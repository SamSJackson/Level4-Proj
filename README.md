# Embedded Watermarking - Bachelor's Project
#### Author: Sam Jackson (2520998J@student.gla.ac.uk)
#### Supervisor: Dr. Jake Lever (Jake.Lever@glasgow.ac.uk)

### Project Goal
Investigate feasibility of embedded watermarks in machine models as a means of authenticating machine-generated text.

### Minor Questions/Sub Research Topics
- Does the length of the document matter? What about a short sample of a large AI document?
- What is an appropriate required confidence to say that a document is AI-generated?
- Are there methods which are model-specific? Can they be broadened? 

These questions serve the purpose of guiding the project questions as well as research direction.

### Research
A lot of this will be reading papers in order to collate ideas and consolidate my own.
These are some existing papers in the area that are useful at the moment:
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10226.pdf | Watermark on Large Language Models (LLM)
- https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.370.pdf | Distillation-Resistant Watermarking

### Datasets
We require a large number of essay documents. Some of which must be AI-generated.
This is necessary for training our models as well as analysis.

Potential datasets at the moment are: 
- https://www.the-good-ai.com/examples | Scrape this website for examples
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/overview | Essay examples with prompts
