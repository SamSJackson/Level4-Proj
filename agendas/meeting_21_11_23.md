# Meeting : DATE

* Time: 14:00-14:30
* Location: SAWB 331 
----------

* Project: Watermarking in Machine-Generated Text
* Student: Samuel Jackson
* Student ID: 2520998J
* Supervisor: Dr. Jake Lever
----------

### Agenda

- Fixing computer/impact [5 mins]
- Z-Score Fixed, how it looks now [5mins]
- Questions [10 mins]
- Misc.

### Progress

- Computer fixed, graphics card removed.
- Remotivated and fixed z-score issues.
- Results look lots more promising/realistic.
- Realised that kirchenbauer's fancy one (developed soft-wmark) is entropy-based.
- Trained on ~300 documents. Takes a long time at the moment due to processing speeds.

### Questions

- I am going to make my own watermark, designed to survive paraphrasing as a primary purpose.
- Making my own paraphraser/watermarker - I could make a entropy-influenced paraphraser or perhaps a new watermark.
  - Is making a paraphraser a feasible idea? It sounds feasible to be completely honest. 
  - "Just" need to think of a way to embed a signature. 
- Concerns about scope:
  - Is three watermarks, evaluated on recursive paraphrasing enough?    
  - I plan to pair this with my own paraphraser/watermarker, with an evaluation in the paper.
- Is fine-tuning a paraphraser close to reasonable?
  - Initially against it but feels possible and I want to expand scope.
  - Potentially fine-tune my own paraphraser - I can use Azure AI for $100 credits, probably enough.
