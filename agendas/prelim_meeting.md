### Questions

- Is space possible on Glasgow Cluster? Google Colab is also feasible for me. Some papers train on LLaMa which is too big. 
- I would like to focus on academic impact - essay watermarking. Is this okay? As opposed to general purpose papers previously produced.
- Would it be reasonable to email some of the researchers in this topic and ask for opinions on research directions?
- I plan to focus on modifying an existing technique and give deeper statistics on essays in particular.
- I also intend to include basic attacks to defeat watermarking and statistics around this - detection after attack.
- Do you want to me send you any of the papers so far?
