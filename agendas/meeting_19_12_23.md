### Agenda

- Finetuned paraphrase model
- Reviewed text dataset - considering new dataset.

### Progress

- Spent a bunch of time reviewing text dataset for generating data - not satisifed with generated data.
  - Lots of generated text not making much sense when I know Llama-2-7B should make sense
- Finetuned paraphrase model - fortunately results look good.
- Fair bit of reading and managed to make sense of creating Z-score - confident in making new watermark.

### Questions

- No questions atm.

### Meeting Minutes

- New dataset makes sense, could pivot towards instruct-style.
- Llama-2-7b should make sense, try different generative strategies.
- Careful that new watermark does not take too long.
- Try out scatterplot visualisation of z-score method.
