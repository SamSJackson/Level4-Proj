Of the 900 experts, 47 per cent say mobile payments are not secure and a staggering 87 per cent expect an increase in mobile payment data breaches over the next year, yet 42 per cent have used mobile payments in 2015. 
 
Only 9 per cent use cash although 89 per cent consider it the most secure method of payment. 
 
The findings of the survey – the 2015 Mobile Payment Security Study – by ISACA, an international IT and cyber security association, imply that many cyber security professionals use mobile payments despite their perception that it is risky. 
 
Eight per cent of the respondents (72) in the study were professionals living in Africa. 
 
The top two risks associated with mobile payments, as chosen by the experts, are use of public WiFi (26 per cent) and lost or stolen devices (21 per cent). They are followed by phishing/shmishing attacks (18 per cent), weak passwords (13 per cent) and user error (7 per cent) 
 
“ISACA members, who are some of the most cyber-aware professionals in the world, are using mobile payments while simultaneously identifying and contemplating their potential security risks. This shows that fear of identity theft or a data breach is not slowing down adoption—and it shouldn’t—as long as risk is properly managed and effective and appropriate security features are in place.” John Pironti, risk advisor with ISACA and president of IP Architects said. 
 
Many of the cyber security experts believe that the most effective security measure way to make mobile payments more secure is using two ways to authenticate their identity (66%). 
 
This is followed by short-term authentication codes (18%), and installing phone-based security apps (9%). 
 
The number of mobile payment users in Africa as at 2012 was estimated at 57.8 million, and only second to 85 million in Asia and the Pacific. The figure is expected to rise to 101.3 million users by 2016 
 
According to the Bank of Ghana 106.4 million mobile money transactions were made in Ghana in 2014 – a massive increase from 36.7 million in 2013.

507592,8e115871-d392-4768-969f-5287cbb3bbd3,TCU DE Mike Tuaua arrested on robbery charges,NBC Sports,"It hasn’t been a good season for TCU’s defense. In fact, it’s been a terrible one. A unit that already came into an expectation-filled 2015 season with mostly new starters has lost, on average, a starter a week in this young season. And now the Frogs have suffered another type of attrition. 
 
Senior defensive end  Mike Tuaua  was arrested Monday afternoon on felony robbery charges following a fight on Friday, Sept. 4. Police say Tuaua and two others arrived uninvited at a party on Lowden Street in Fort Worth, got kicked out, and the attacked three male TCU students, making off with a case of beer. 
 
NBC DFW reports police are looking for another player to place under the same charges, but no arrest has been made. 
 
TCU head coach  Gary Patterson  alluded to off-field troubles earlier this season. “You’ve got to all be in,” he said last week. “I wish I could be more positive, but I think it’s better to be the way it is. If we’re not acting right on and off the field, then I’ve got a problem. Right now I’m not real happy with the buy-in.” 
 
A senior out of Rohnert Park, Calif., Tuaua arrived at TCU by way of Santa Rosa Junior College and placed fourth on the Frogs’ co-Big 12 championship squad with five sacks. Tuaua was listed as TCU’s second-team defensive end for the Frogs’ 56-37 win over SMU Saturday. 
       
No. 13 Oregon has a crucial game against No. 18 Utah on Saturday, and the Ducks don’t yet know who will start at quarterback Saturday evening. 
 
Speaking to reporters Monday, Ducks offensive coordinator  Scott Frost  said the finger injury that sidelined  Vernon Adams   last week can not get any worse than it already is, but that does not mean he’ll automatically be named the starter. 
   
Scott Frost wouldn't name a starter yet for this week, but said Adams finger is past the stage of possible further injury.

The  Eugene Register-Guard , though, reported Monday “the Ducks plan to fly” with Adams . 
 
As for the man himself? “I hope so. My finger is really good,” Adams told reporters after practice , adding he could have played in Oregon’s 61-28 blowout of Georgia State.  Jeff Lockie   completed 23-of-31 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns in Adams’s place. 
 
Adams connected on 22-of-39 throws for 309 yards with a touchdown (plus one rushing score) and two interceptions in Oregon’s 31-28 loss to Michigan State on Sept. 12. 
 
“I would have loved to see him have his chance on a big stage like that and be 100 percent. He wasn’t,” Frost said of Adams’s performance at Michigan State. “That being said, you’re never going to play a game 100 percent, so that happens across football and it’s no excuse. 
 
“That was kind of his coming-out party for the world watching him, and for him to have the courage and competitiveness to go out there and play knowing he wasn’t at his best says a lot about him.” 
       
UCLA is off to a good start to the season, but they have been doing so without one key player on the defensive side of the football. Defensive back Ishmael Adams  was suspended by the program on September 1 following his arrest for alleged robbery. On Monday Adams received some relatively good news regarding his legal battle after Los Angeles District Attorney’s office opted to forgo felony charges and referred the case for misdemeanor filing consideration . The Orange County Register reported the updated legal news Monday. 
 
Adams was originally arrested on a robbery charge and was sent to jail in lieu of a $100,000 bond. The original reports tied Adams to a forced entry to take a cell phone from an Uber driver , which led to the felony charge possibility. UCLA indefinitely suspended Adams as a result while the legal process unfolded, which is customary for players at any school when legal issues enter the picture. Adams remains suspended from the program and no status change with the Bruins is expected until after this legal issue is taken care of first. 
 
Adams is scheduled to appear in court tomorrow (Tuesday) morning.

The Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) is making a renewed bid for a nationally-approved enterprise zone that would give businesses moving into the Waterfront an extended rates ""holiday"". 
 
A similar bid in 2011 was shelved in favour of sites in Darlaston and Wolverhampton. 
 
But the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has invited a new round of applications - and Dudley Council and the LEP are going all out to win it for Brierley Hill this time. 
 
The LEP intends to submit the bid by the deadline on Friday (September 18) and, if granted, the Government would cover a 100 per cent business rates discount for five years at the Waterfront, where 40 per cent of the 650,000 sq ft of office space is currently vacant. 
 
Companies could also get tax breaks for investing in plant and machinery and funds raised by a growth in business rates over 25 years would be reinvested to further develop the enterprise zone, which would eventually also cover Harts Hill. 
 
A report to Dudley Council's cabinet which is due to meet on Wednesday (September 16) says that, if the Waterfront was fully occupied, it would create 4,600 jobs - on top of another 6,000 if other plans for an additional million square feet of office space in the area come to fruition.

Deputy Dudley Council leader Councillor Judy Foster said: ""It's not a done deal - but it would be fantastic news if it was granted. 
 
""There are lots of things going on to regenerate Brierley Hill anyway - we've got the Brierley Hill Area Action Plan and Dudley's own business development zone, which gives new businesses a rates reduction for two years. 
 
""We would be delighted if the submission for a national enterprise zone was accepted - but if it isn't we've still got other initiatives to bring Brierley Hill along.""

This is part of a series of case studies showcasing how companies achieve their business communication objectives with Mitel technology 

The move to virtualization enables an agile remote workforce and business continuity 

Providing mission critical logistics services for the global market place and helping clients stay one step ahead of the competition requires a dedication to customer care and the use of leading-edge technology. Choice Logistics, a New York City-based global company that stores and delivers critical parts for major technology products, operates on six continents, in 80+ countries, and has over 400+ locations throughout the world. In order to keep operating 24/7/365 and serving customers regardless of location and in the event of natural disasters and power outages, the company deployed technology to enable remote workers. The company has deployed a variety of Mitel solutions, including those that provide communication and collaboration capabilities for desktop and mobile workers, as well as its contact center solution, and has recently virtualized their Mitel unified communications and collaboration (UCC) solutions for the data center and the desktop. 

In 2011, Hurricane Irene wreaked havoc on Manhattan and shut down the transit service. It was impossible for employees, including the contact center agents who are essential for providing service to customers around the globe, to get to the office. Despite having a business continuity site in New Jersey with a dedicated room, it was a challenge for Choice’s agents to get to the back-up location. This helped Choice Logistics understand the value of having remote workers and to implement solutions that would enable employees to be able to work remotely. 

Since that time, Choice Logistics has used Mitel’s contact center solution to enable some of their top contact center agents to work from home. These at-home agents provide backup in case of an emergency, and can be used to quickly fill in if any agents call in sick or get to work late. All that is required is booting up their computer and logging in. 

The biggest benefit of remote agents has been business continuity. According to Fran Iuzzini, Vice President Communications & Facilities at Choice Logistics, “We recently had to vacate the building due to an explosion in the electrical room. We were able to use our home agents, while some people went to our warehouse in Long Island City and used Mitel’s hot desking capabilities to log in. We didn’t miss a call.” 

After Hurricane Irene, Choice Logistics deployed a virtualized Mitel solution at its backup data center at SunGard, a business continuity site. The continuity site is an extension of the headquarters site and has the same capabilities, including directory contacts, speed dials, and all of the capabilities on the agents’ phones. 

According to Colleen Mantella, Director Global Logistics Center Operations, “As a result of deploying the virtual solution, as devastating as Hurricane Sandy was, the following year, Choice was able to support the business with minimal impact to our clients.” 

With the virtualized Mitel system at its headquarters, plus a virtualized Mitel system housed at SunGard, Choice Logistics is confident that their phone system will never go down. Iuzzini explained, “Three times a year the building performs electrical maintenance and shuts power to the building. In the past, we had to bring people to SunGard, but now we just tell people to work from home. If we ever have to vacate the building, and operate at SunGard, our employees can log into the Mitel phones at just like they’re logging in at their desks.” 
Attract and Retain the Best 
Since the company began using remote workers in 2011, a side benefit has been the ability to retain quality staff. Iuzzini noted that there were several occasions where experienced agents needed to relocate due to personal reasons. Rather than lose those agents, the company enabled them to work remotely, saving the company time, money and retaining essential skills and expertise. According to Iuzzini, “We don't have to hire a new employee and spend 2-3 weeks of training. Instead, we can retain these experienced agents that already know the business, which reduces our stress and overhead.” 

Another benefit is that people are more likely to be willing to work off-shift hours if they can work from home rather than having to commute into the office late at night or early in the morning. In addition, the use of remote workers has helped reduce overtime costs. Iuzzini explained, “If someone lets you know at 03:00 that they won’t make it for their 05:00 shift, that gives you only have two hours to find someone who can come in, which is impossible in New York. Instead, agents working at home can log in and get on to the system immediately and fill in.” 

The use of remote agents has been so successful that as the company looks to hire new contact center agents, they are looking at people who can work remotely if possible. Iuzzini noted, “Because of the 24/7 nature of our business and the need to answer calls and to keep the business running during hurricanes, train strikes, etc., we are pushing towards growing our remote workforce.” 

Choice expanded its remote capabilities to field and managerial staff, and now has a large number of managers, executives, and sales professionals who work remotely in various locations around the globe. 

According to Mantella, “Choice has been expanding our remote workforce to the West Coast, which has assisted with our late evening coverage. Having staff located outside of the metropolitan area also mitigates our exposure when an event happens in the local area, such as a blizzard or blackout.” 

The company currently uses Microsoft Lync for chat and web/desktop sharing, which integrates with the Mitel phone system using a Mitel gateway. Choice is looking at Mitel’s collaboration solutions, rather than have two separate solutions, and will use Mitel for conferencing and other unified communications and collaboration capabilities. 
Making the Right Choice 
The use of remote workers is growing rapidly, with 20% of the global workforce currently telecommuting. Since 2012, there has been a 20% increase in telecommuting in the US. 

Having remote workers is not for every company, and there are certainly some challenges, such as managing remote employees and ensuring that productivity is high. While some managers are skeptical when it comes to remote workers, as it is hard to monitor what they are doing, they will need to ultimately embrace this growing and inevitable trend. For companies like Choice Logistics, using remote workers is certainly the right choice.

Iuzzini noted, “Because of the 24/7 nature of our business and the need to answer calls and to keep the business running during hurricanes, train strikes, etc., we are pushing towards growing our remote workforce.” Choice expanded its remote capabilities to field and managerial staff, and now has a large number of managers, executives, and sales professionals who work remotely in various locations around the globe. According to Mantella, “Choice has been expanding our remote workforce to the West Coast, which has assisted with our late evening coverage. Having staff located outside of the metropolitan area also mitigates our exposure when an event happens in the local area, such as a blizzard or blackout.” The company currently uses Microsoft Lync for chat and web/desktop sharing, which integrates with the Mitel phone system using a Mitel gateway. Choice is looking at Mitel’s collaboration solutions, rather than have two separate solutions, and will use Mitel for conferencing and other unified communications and collaboration capabilities. Making the Right Choice The use of remote workers is growing rapidly, with 20% of the global workforce currently telecommuting. Since 2012, there has been a 20% increase in telecommuting in the US. Having remote workers is not for every company, and there are certainly some challenges, such as managing remote employees and ensuring that productivity is high. While some managers are skeptical when it comes to remote workers, as it is hard to monitor what they are doing, they will need to ultimately embrace this growing and inevitable trend. For companies like Choice Logistics, using remote workers is certainly the right choice. This paper is sponsored by Mitel.
