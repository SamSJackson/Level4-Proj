fb416cd3-4aac-4b12-869b-440cf59348b5,Carly Fiorina's epic fail on science and everything else,News,Daily Kos,"To hear the glowing reviews late last week, Carly Fiorina won the September 16 Republican presidential debate. And by debate, we mean a spectacle of pithy soundbites cranking out revenue like a ratings engine devoid of judges, scoring, and winners and losers. 
But as Josh Marshall and others have noted, Fiorina has a habit of just making shit up. Her problems begin when anyone with an Internet connection and reading comprehension skills outside of the cheering squads takes notice : 
 2) California ""destroys lives and livelihoods with environmental regulations"" 
[B]etween 1993 and 2013, thanks to energy efficiency, the average residential electricity bill in California declined, on an inflation-adjusted basis, by 4 percent, even as bills rose elsewhere in the country. Between 1990 and 2012, the state cut per-capita carbon emissions by 25 percent even as its GDP increased by 37 percent. ... Oh, and California created more jobs than any other state in the nation last year, with the fifth-highest GDP growth rate. And its budget is balanced. 
[...] 
6) ""Coal provides half the energy in this nation still"" 
 
No, it doesn't. Coal provides 20 percent of the total primary energy used in the US. 
 Fiorina claims to have seen babies cruelly being kept alive as a tissue farm for Planned Parenthood. In fact no such video exists. Doctor Professor Pastor Carly Fiorina has also been a regular critic of the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds that . . . something along the lines of Obama should have solved it all his first day in the White House with a single phone call to the Supreme Leader. And of course she plays up her business success when it's been widely reported how she bungled her own big merger between Compaq and HP so thoroughly that she was kicked to the curb by panicked shareholders and fellow executives : Six weeks after publication of this article that pilloried Hewlett-Packard, the board hired Mark Hurd to replace Fiorina. Only then did the company acquire the management skills needed to take the raw material that was there and transform it into a world leader in technology. In the three years since Hurd became CEO, the results have been truly remarkable. Still, consider that the current GOP front-runner is a trust fund braggart who thinks China has collaborated with NASA and others to hoax us into believing several hundred thousand super accurate thermometers display local and global temperature inaccurately. Or that fully one-third of the GOP base and at least half of the tea party admit they are or were convinced that the government was going to take over the American state of Texas a few weeks ago.

The firm boosted production after US sales rose by 30% over the past six months. European sales were up by 9% over the same period.

Quorn ceo Kevin Brennan said: “There is a growing trend towards meat reduction around the world and as more consumers turn to alternative sources of protein, Quorn has seen a growth in sales globally. “The US market in particular is waking up to the opportunity beyond meat free burgers, which is great news for us as our existing range of products is second to none, both in terms of the breadth and quality of our offering. And we’ve got plenty more new products in the pipeline too, as we‘re always looking to bring something new and exciting to the market.”

US consumers were attracted to the quality and diversity of the Quorn range, which was high in protein and low in fat, he added.

Quorn had targeted annual US business growth of 30% – with the goal of building an American operation three times its current size by 2020.

Exports to Nordic countries and Germany seen also seen strong double digit growth over the past six months, building on strong performances in both markets last year, said the firm.

The meat free manufacturer has enlisted the help of sports superstar Mo Farah, as it boosted TV advertising in Germany and the Nordics to help further drive growth. “There is a growing trend towards meat reduction around the world and as more consumers turn to alternative sources of protein, Quorn has seen a growth in sales globally.” “As we push to accelerate our European exports we are investing heavily in TV advertising, particularly in Sweden and Germany,” said Brennan. “We know this will help to generate trial, and we’re confident that once people taste our products, they’ll repeat purchase, fuelling long-term demand.

“Quorn is even able to export Mo Farah through international marketing campaigns. Mo Farah, the star of our UK ads, also features in the Swedish advertisements and consumers there love him.”

The increased capacity followed the completion of a £30M investment by the company to create a third fermenter at its Billingham production plant, near Middlesbrough. The firm made about 22,000t of mycoprotein per year, the core ingredient of Quorn products, at the site.

Quorn currently exports to 15 international markets, with overall sales growing by 7% over the past six months, “at a time when most food manufacturers are seeing flat sales”, said the firm.

Aquarian farmer David Williams points out that their food uses far less water than other groups such ""natural foods"".

It doesn't seem clear why quinoa crops would offer greater value here where traditional 'aquifer' farming could provide better yields though we can still speculate they might do so due just how efficient it works even if you've already cut back your livestock feed used per acre vs making use entirely through animal breeding practices like all forms human driven genetic engineering using only humans rather.

After my daughter arrived my perspective changed, and I had a strong desire to work from home. I always enjoyed crafting and creating, and I turned to those talents to make working from home a viable option. While I had experience in crafting, I had very little experience in sewing. In the summer of 2009, Rustic Horseshoe was born. The first pattern I created was my Classic Collection Stick Horse… It has come a long way in six years as I honed my talents. My son arrived in January 2011 and I “retired” from my career in May 2011 on a leap of faith that this venture would pan out. In my childhood there was never a time we didn’t have horses, and I have always loved them. (You can tell when you look at my designs since most are horses.) I love creating and designing new patterns, and I have a long list of ideas for new ones to create as time permits.

                            Harper was unapologetic about the law, which has effectively disenfranchised about 1.4 million Canadians who have lived abroad for more than five years and sparked anger among many of them. 
 

                            ""Obviously, we're going to make sure that we have, I think, fair rules to make sure Canadian elections are decided by Canadian residents,"" Harper said during a campaign event in Calgary. 
 

                            ""I've never heard Mr. Gretzky challenge that particular notion."" 
 

                            Gretzky, who was raised in Brantford but has lived for years in the United States, appeared with Harper at a Friday evening event in Toronto. 
 

                            While Harper may not have heard from the Great One about losing his right to vote, other Canadians have been far more vocal, including actor Donald Sutherland, who denounced the law in a recent opinion piece. 
 

                            ""I'm an expatriate and the Harper government won't let expatriates participate in Canadian elections,"" Sutherland wrote in the Globe and Mail. 
 

                            Two other expats have begun a crowdfunding effort to allow them to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case after Ontario's top court upheld the law as constitutional. 
 

                            In a tweet Friday, Gill Frank, who helped launch the constitutional challenge, wondered why Gretzky would be campaigning for Harper if he's precluded from voting for him. 
 

                            Another expat, Nicolas Duchastel de Montrouge, is running against Harper in his Calgary riding to highlight what he considers absurd rules that prevent him from voting, but not from running as a candidate. 
 

                            Harper is effectively ""modifying"" the Constitution, Duchastel de Montrouge said. 
 

                            ""The Constitution doesn't have any residency requirements,"" he said. ""It says every single of citizen of Canada is entitled to vote."" 
 

                            Duchastel de Montrouge, now of suburban Seattle, is trying to get the required 100 signatures from residents he needs to become an official candidate — although he is discouraging people from voting for him if he does run. 
 

                            The first signature he got, he said, came from a fellow passenger on the flight to Calgary — a self-described Conservative. 
 

                            Gretzky, who recently endorsed Patrick Brown in his successful bid to lead Ontario's Progressive Conservative party, nevertheless won praise from Harper for representing more than just great hockey. 
 

                            ""He has been, even as an expat, a fantastic ambassador,"" Harper said, ""not just for our great national winter sport but for this country."" 
 

                            Besides Sutherland and Gretzky, disenfranchised expats with strong ties to Canada could include such well-known figures as Neil Young, Celine Dion, William Shatner or even Sidney Crosby, another NHL superstar who lives in the United States.

Ondo State Police Command has suspended two of its officers, Inspectors Oladipupo Fabunmi and Haruna idris, who were said to have assaulted a middle-aged woman, Aderonke Adenigba‎, which led to her death. 
 
Addressing reporters at the Command Headquarters in Akure on Friday, the Commissioner of Police in Ondo State, Isaac Eke, stated that on the fateful day, 10 policemen were said to have stormed an uncompleted building opposite late Adenigba’s house on a tip-off that some miscreants were hiding there. 
 
Mr. Eke claimed that two of the miscreants escaped into the late woman’s house when the two officers were after them. 
 
It was recorded that there was an argument between the woman and the Policemen when the woman fell down. 
 
After the policemen had left the scene, the late woman‎ became ill and died before she could be rushed to the hospital. 
 
However, when Channels Television visited the house, two of the children of the deceased, Daniel Bello and Obiosa Tosan alleged that one of the policemen hit the woman on the chest with his gun after-which she started fuming from her mouth and nostrils. They also claimed that their mother died before she could get medical treatment. 
 
Meanwhile, investigation is in progress to discover the circumstances surrounding late Aderonke Adenigba’s ‎death. Her remains have been deposited at the mortuary of the State Specialist Hospital Akure. (Channels TV)

UK and Ireland,"Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka returned safely to Earth with two other astronauts from the International Space Station Saturday with the record for having spent the most time in space.

Padalka -- who has spent a total of 879 days in space over five separate trips -- touched ground on the barren Kazakh steppe on schedule at 0051 GMT along with Kazakh cosmonaut Aidyn Aimbetov and Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen.

""Landing has taken place,"" a spokesman for Russia's space agency Roscosmos told AFP. ""All is well."" 

Padalka led the 44th expedition at the ISS, breaking a 10-year-old record for the total number of days spent in the cosmos on June 28 when he surpassed the figure of 803 days, nine hours and 41 minutes achieved by Sergei Krikalev, another Russian.

His most recent mission began on March 27 when he blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome with compatriot Mikhail Kornienko and American Scott Kelly.

Mogensen, the first Dane in Space and Aimbetov, the third cosmonaut from his country, had a comparatively short stay at the ISS having entered space in the Soyuz TMA-18M on September 2 and docking two days later on September 4.

Space travel has been one of the few areas of international cooperation between Russia and the West that has not been completely destroyed by the Ukraine crisis.

But the joint space program has still faced difficulties this year. 

Russia put the breaks on all space travel for almost 3 months after the failure of the unmanned Progress freighter in late April. 

The doomed ship lost contact with Earth and burned up in the atmosphere, forcing a group of astronauts to spend an extra month on the ISS.

In May, another Russian spacecraft, a Proton-M rocket carrying a Mexican satellite, malfunctioned and crashed in Siberia soon after its launch.

New Delhi, Sep 13 (IANS) In a major boost to the BJP, RSS affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad made a comeback at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) after 14 years on Sunday by winning the students union joint secretary's post. 
 
The joint secretary's post was won by AVBP's Saurabh Sharma. 
 
The JNUSU president's post was won by the CPI-affiliated All India Students Federation's (AISF) candidate Kanhaiya Kumar, while vice president and general secretary's posts were retained by Left-leaning All India Students Association (AISA). The seats were won by Shehla Rashid Shora and Rama Naga respectively. 
 
""The poll results were declared at 8 a.m. today (Sunday). Since paper ballots are used for polling and counting is done manually, the counting process takes longer at the JNU. The voting percentage at the university is also relatively high. The ABVP made a comeback at the JNU after almost 15 years,"" said JNU poll's chief election commissioner Praveen Thallapelli. 
 
The AISF won the president's post by 67 votes over AISA, while AISA nominee won the vice-president's post against his ABVP rival by 234 votes. For the general secretary's post, AISA candidate defeated ABVP nominee by 213 votes while joint secretary's post was claimed by ABVP, defeating AISA by 28 votes. 
 
The ABVP last won a post in the JNU elections in 2001 when Sandeep Mahapatra became the president by a vote's margin. 
 
Shehla Rashid of AISA is the first Kashmiri woman in JNU history to contest the students' union polls and win in the central panel. She is also this year's highest polled candidate (1,387), according to JNU sources. 
 
""This victory is a mandate for carrying on the struggles for which JNUSU is known. We will carry on the struggle for social justice, gender justice and against privatisation and saffronisation of education,"" said Shehla after winning the vice president's post. 
 
""We are content with the overall Left mandate, but we have to take cognizance of the proliferation of the right-wing in the campus and work collectively towards establishing a Left-progressive consciousness on the campus,"" she added. 
 
The students' union elections in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Friday recorded 53.3 percent turnout, a marginal dip over last year, when the turnout was 54.58 percent.

As per the Gregorian calendar, either the festival falls during late September or the early October, which is the beginning of high tourist season (autumn) in Nepal. 
 

 As per the Hindu myth, the king of the heaven, Indra visited Kathmandu Valley in search of the sacred flower Parijat for his mother, to perform a holy ceremony in the heaven. Indra was caught stealing the flower and was kept hostage by the Tantric of the valley. When Lord Indra did not return to heaven, and the rainfall stopped to pour across the world, pleads of human on earth grabbed the attention of Indra’s mother, Dakine Devi. In search of her son, she came to the valley and discovered that Indra was imprisoned by the tantric. After the tough negotiation and the oath taken by Indra himself for the timely rainfall in the valley, the lord of the heaven was released. Since then the festival is observed in Kathmandu to please Indra so that he would provide enough rain in the valley.  

 

 
The festival kicks off by putting up a 36 feet long Linga (Yasingh), a ceremonial pole, which is made by the chosen tree from the woodland of Kavre, the district east of Kathmandu. During the occasion of pole erection the vibrant display from the living deity Akash Bhairab, who wears colorful large mask and spouts Jaad and raksi (Nepali local liquors) from the mouth is worthwhile observing. 
 

 
Households throughout Kathmandu (especially Newars) display images and sculptures of Indra and Bhairab at this time of year. On the final day of Indra Jatra the Kumari (living goddess) along with other Living Gods of the valley Kumar & Ganesha, leave the seclusion of their temples in adorned palanquins and lead processions through the streets of Kathmandu to thank Indra, the rain god. 
 

 
  
 
The main attraction of the festival is the procession of chariots and masked dancers representing deities and demons. During the festival varieties of masked dancing sequences from different locales of Kathmandu like Sawa Bhakku Bhairav dance from Halchowk, Majipa Lakhey dance from Majipat, Devi Nach and Yeravathatthi from Naradevi Mahakali and Kathi Maka Nach from Bhaktapur add fascinating attractions to all the wonderful highlights of this vibrant festival. 
 

 
On the final day after the Linga (Yasingh) is pulled down the festival ends. Later on, the linga is taken to the confluence of holy Bagmati and Bishnumati Rivers in Teku to submerge it. 
 

 The great festival of Indra Jatra was celebrated with great joy in Kathmandu Durbar Square this year. Though the devastating earthquake shook the country during April this year, the natives of the valley still celebrated the festival with their heads high. Their hearts filled with pride and joy despite the grounded monuments all over the ancient heritage site, the people observed it with great enthusiasm. People were gathered in numbers at the site to enjoy the authentic Newari music and to witness the Living Goddess Kumari processing in her chariot followed by the chariots of Vhairab and Ganesh. Though the celebration site looked bit empty compared to last year celebration, the energy of the people witnessing the festival and the pride they had towards their heritage and culture was remarkable to observe.

7fa3db5c-74f4-41e8-8243-877811f38798,August AAII Asset Allocation Survey: Equity Exposure Declines To A 10-Month Low,Blog,All Articles on Seeking Alpha,"Summary Stock and stock fund allocations decreased, but remain above their historical average for the 29th month in a row. After three months of essentially no change, bond and bond fund allocations inched above their historical average for the first time since April. On the whole, members aren't waiting for a change in Fed policy to make portfolio changes. Individual investors reduced their exposure to stocks and stock funds last month, according to the August AAII Asset Allocation Survey. The reduction put stock and stock fund allocations at a 10-month low. Cash allocations rose to a 15-month high and fixed-income exposure rose to a five-month high. The survey period covered the entire month of August, with many of the responses recorded before the late-month drop in stock prices.
Stock and stock fund allocations declined by 2.4 percentage points to 65.0%. This is the smallest exposure to equities since October 2014 (64.1%). Even with the decrease, stock and stock fund allocations remained above their historical average of 60% for the 29th consecutive month.
Bond and bond fund allocations rose 0.8%, to 16.3%. The modest increase follows three consecutive months with essentially no change. Fixed-income allocations are now above their historical average of 16.0% for the first time since April 2015.
Cash allocations rose for the fourth time in five months, increasing 1.6% to 18.7%. This is the largest amount allocated to cash since May 2014 (19.2%). Cash allocations were also at 18.7% in October 2014. Even with last month's increase, August was the 45th consecutive month with a cash allocation reading below its historical average of 24%.
As stated above, the survey period covered the entire month of August. The correction in U.S. stocks did not start until August 20 (when the S&P 500 fell by 4.5%). As such, the survey incorporates, but does not fully reflect, the actions of surveyed AAII members in response to the recent drop in stock prices.
Exposure to equities among individual investors had been trending down somewhat prior to the start of the recent market correction; August was the third out of the last four months to show a decline in stock and stock fund allocations. At the same time, cash allocations have been trending upwards. In addition, our weekly Sentiment Survey has been registering relatively higher levels of pessimism. Bearish sentiment has been above its historical average during eight out of the past 12 weeks. During the entire 52-week period prior to June 2015, bearish sentiment was above its historical average of 30.0% just nine times.
Last month's special question asked AAII members whether there are any portfolio changes they are postponing until the after the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve is announced. The majority of respondents (62%) said ""no."" Many of these members said that they follow long-term strategies or that they make buy and sell decisions based on the attributes of individual securities and funds. Others said that the first rate hike is already priced in or that it will not have any lasting impact.
About 20% said that they are waiting for a change in monetary policy before taking certain investment actions. Several of these respondents specifically said that they are postponing buying bonds or bond funds. Some respondents said that they intended to increase their equity allocations once the first rate hike is announced.
Here is a sampling of the responses:""No, I'm a long-term investor and not a market timer.""""No, the rate change should be small and the market has already taken it into account.""""No, because the fundamentals of a company are more important than interest rates.""""I will reallocate some cash to bonds after interest rates increase.""""Yes, purchasing more bonds after the Fed raises rates.""

f6db3867-310f-4f9e-99f1-550e9c9c06fa,A unique day for Fishguard Sports,News,Milford Mercury,"IT was a unique day for Fishguard Sports AFC yesterday as the club officially opened its new pitch and training room facilities at Tregroes Park. 
 
A host of club officials, supporters, guests, and players past and present were in attendance for the official unveiling, and afterwards were able to enjoy a bar and BBQ and watch the first games on the new surface. 
 
Fishguard Chairman Owain Duggan, who has been instrumental in keeping the club running in recent years, welcomed everyone in attendance, and said it was an “honour” to be involved in what was a celebration for not just the club but the community as a whole. 
 
He explained how the club has first purchased the field in 1991, and while there had been many difficulties since in terms of securing grants and other issues, he said: “I want to thank the trustees of the club for their vision all those years ago. 
 
“There were times we doubted today would happen but we were determined and got there in the end.” 
 
Owain explained how the club had needed to raise £25,000 to press on with the project, but had done so via grants from the Cita Trust and Sport Wales. 
 
He expressed his gratitude to all the club members and committee men who had worked tirelessly over the summer to ensure things were ready on time, notably club vice Chairman Matthew Lamb, Nigel Davies, Gary Delaney and Gareth ‘Gaffa’ Thomas, secretary Steve Jones and all sponsors and contractors. 
   Promoted stories

Love has to be remade all the time Posted Sep 14, 2015 SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL “The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.” Andy Warhol It is commonly agreed that online dating provided people with a larger pool of romantic candidates. However, it is not certain whether online dating is better way to find long-term profound love than conventional offline dating is. In order to examine this issue, I will first describe what I mean by profound love and will then consider the value of online dating in finding such love. Profound Love “I date this girl for two years—and then the nagging starts: ‘I wanna know your name.’"" Mike Binder Profundity and superficiality Profound activities are essential for our development and wellbeing; they have an enduring influence on our life and may also shape our personality. Superficial activities affect only the surface of our lives—they are more limited in their scope and immediate impact and they can have a negative influence on our lives if we engage in them too frequently. The distinction between profound and superficial phenomena is expressed in the romantic realm in the differentiation between romantic intensity and profundity, a distinction that is seldom made. Romantic intensity is like a snapshot of a given moment, whereas in romantic profundity the temporal dimension of love has greater significance. Romantic intensity expresses the momentary measure of passionate, often sexual, desire. Romantic profundity embodies occurrences of intense love over long periods of time, along with meaningful experiences that help the individuals to develop and flourish. Time is destructive for romantic intensity, and constitutive of romantic profundity. The centrality of the connection and the dialogical sharing ""Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone; it has to be made, like bread, remade all the time, made new."" Ursula K. LeGuin In her excellent new book, Zwischen Ich und Du: Eine dialogische Philosophie der Liebe, Angelika Krebs (2015) argues that romantic love is not about each partner having the other as his or her object; love is about the connection between the partners. Loving somebody implies being deeply satisfied with the experiences and activities you share with the beloved. She further claims that at the basis of profound love there is dialogical sharing, which constitutes the nature of the connection. Several empirical studies confirm that the quality of romantic relationships indeed increases with shared participation (e.g., Aron, et al., 2000; O’Leary, et al., 2010). Choosing a romantic partner “Happy people plan actions, they don't plan results.” Dennis Wholey In light of the centrality of the connection and dialogical sharing in long-term profound love, choosing a romantic partner should focus on the value of the individual as a partner (more than as a person). Many of the qualities of the individual as a person can also be discerned by others who are superficially observing the individual; the agent has no privileged status in this regard. Revealing the value of the individual as a partner typically requires longer and more profound acquaintance with the individual. The most relevant criterion for long-term romantic love is whether we prioritize the superficial or the profound in our search for romance, as well as whether we focus on the negative or the positive. In this respect, there are four major ways of choosing a romantic partner: (a) The checklist manner: rejection at the first meeting (superficial, negative); (b) Love at first sight: falling in love at the first meeting (superficial, positive); (c) “There is nothing wrong with him”: detecting profound flaws (profound, negative); (d) Bringing out the best in each other: accentuate profound positive advantages (profound, positive). The checklist manner ""Some people think having large breasts makes a woman stupid. Actually, it's quite the opposite: a woman having large breasts makes men stupid.“ Rita Rudner Establishing a checklist of the perfect partner's desirable (and undesirable) qualities is a common practice. Having compiled such a list, you mark next to each quality whether this is an attribute of a prospective partner. This kind of search, which is most common in online dating, has two major flaws: (a) it typically lacks any intrinsic hierarchy that would accord each quality a different weight—hence, it ignores the issue of romantic profundity; (b) it focuses on the other person’s qualities in isolation—hence, it ignores the centrality of the connection between the agents in profound love and therefore fails to consider the value of the other person as a partner. The above flaws are particularly evident in online dating where such a list is compiled by each person in her self-description and is typically discussed at length in their first interactions. The checklist is a fast and efficient way of evaluating the other’s qualities, making it an initial useful tool in online dating, where there are many alluring candidates from whom to choose. Love at first sight “She was funny and sexy and cute, and I was immediately attracted to her personality. We may speak here about ‘Net chemistry’.” A man describing his first chat with his woman Love at first sight is essentially intense love. The great (typically, physical) attractiveness strikes you like a flash of lightening and you want to prolong the time you spend with the other person. Love at first sight can be the basis of long-term profound love, provided that characteristics revealed in later acquaintance enhance—or, at least, do not contradict—those attributed at first sight. Love at first sight cannot be profound as there has been no time for creating such profoundness. Falling in love in cyberspace is similar to cases of love at first sight: we do not have all the required information, but we fill in the gaps with idealized assumptions. In light of this similarity, we can speak about “love at first chat.” For example, one may detect in the first chat a sense of humor and wittiness and instantly fall in love with the sender. It should be noted that although beauty has a powerful impact at first sight, the weight of this impact decreases as time passes, when we get to know the person’s other characteristics of. Likewise, wittiness has a powerful impact at first chat, but its impact may be reduced once we the person’s other characteristics begin to surface. When wittiness is perceived to be superficial, and more profound characteristics, such as kindness and wisdom, are found to be wanting, the weight of the initial positive impact of wittiness is likely to diminish. Although love at first chat can reveal more profound qualities than those involved in love at first sight, those qualities may still be superficial as the agent has no way of knowing whether the prospective partner is representing himself accurately. However, when the first chat turns into an online, and then offline, relationship, the likelihood of finding profound love increases.  “There is nothing wrong with him” ""The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook."" William James Unlike the two previous ways of choosing a romantic partner, this way takes into account profound qualities, and when no profound negative qualities are detected, the prospective partner may be given a chance (Gottlieb, 2010). Compared to the checklist way, the way of detecting profound flaws is more sophisticated and realistic. It assumes the presence of flaws in each of us, and hence it focuses merely on the very profound flaws. Focusing upon profound flaws is valuable, but it involves a more complex search, since detecting profound qualities such as kindness is more difficult than detecting superficial qualities such as external appearance. In online dating, it is even more difficult to detect profound flaws. People can learn to present themselves in many positive ways that hide their deeper flaws. Offline interactions over a long time are required for such flaws to be exposed. Bringing out the best in each other “I’ll let you be in my dream, if I can be in yours.” Bob Dylan Although detecting negative qualities is typically more valuable than detecting positive qualities, detecting positive qualities is of great value in establishing a long-term profound loving connection. A positive quality that is particularly significant for this purpose is bringing out the best in each other. Research has demonstrated that when a close romantic partner views you and behaves toward you in a way that is congruent with your ideal self, you move nearer toward your ideal self. This has been termed the ""Michelangelo phenomenon."" Just as Michelangelo released the ideal form hidden in the marble, our romantic partners serve to ""sculpt"" us in light of our ideal self, enabling the best in us to emerge.  In such relationships, personal growth and flourishing is evident and is typically demonstrated in claims such as: “I'm a better person when I am with her” (Drigotas et al., 1999). This way can hardly be used in the fast and superficial world of online dating. The ability to bring out the best in each other requires ongoing shared experiences and activities that are clearly absent in online dating. Online dating sites and romantic profundity “Online sex is a wonderful invention. Now, if only everyone could type faster.” Unknown Matchmaking online sites promise to expedite two different types of romantic activities: (a) identifying romantic partners, and (b) developing long-term profound love. There is no doubt that these sites can successfully fulfill the first task; it is disputable if they also fulfill the second. The algorithms used by these sites can be highly predictive in avoiding pairings that are unlikely to succeed, which constitute the majority of possible pairings, but they still leave a considerable minority from which to choose.  Furthermore, matchmaking sites claim that their main aim is to predict profound love, but this is very difficult to do when the joint profound activities underlying such love have not yet taken place (Finkel et al., 2012). Since profound love is generated by many and various joint activities, the limited types of such activities available online reduce the likelihood of generating profound love. It is very hard to accurately identify the major profound flaws and advantages of your partner through online dating alone. One cannot bring out the best in the other when the relationship lacks diverse mutual interactions and hence what Krebs terms profound “shared dialogue.” Indeed, Finkel and colleagues (2012) argue that the matchmaking sites’ claim that the essential qualities of a relationship can be predicted from characteristics of the potential partners that exist before they have met is contrary to substantial scientific research indicating that pre-existing personal qualities account for a very small percentage of the variance in relationship success. In addition, the  need to engage in mutual time-consuming activities in profound love is contrary to the prevailing attitude of contemporary high-speed cyber society (Ben-Ze’ev, 2004; Rosa, 2013) where timing is more significant than time. Fast changes are the ultimate model of our cyber society and many people feel that staying in one place is tantamount to treading water. We are addicted to the fast and the new happening in the constant flux of cyber society and are averse to investing time, including in romantic relations. Indeed, empirical evidence indicates that spouses’ investment of time in their marriage has decreased over time (Finkel et al., 2014). The lack of this investment further impedes romantic profundity, which is based upon spending meaningful time together. Although the reluctance to invest time and resources in romantic relationships characterizes both online and offline romantic relationships, it is much more evident in cyberspace, where everything happens faster and is expected to be easier. Integrating online and offline dating “Nobody in his right mind would call me a nymphomaniac. I only have cybersex with witty men.” Unknown Often, integrating the advantages of two different activities can be beneficial. In online and offline dating, there are both beneficial and harmful types of such integration. Beneficial integration occurs when online dating is used to locate possible suitable candidates with whom to start a romantic relationship, after which the partners meet and then establish a relationship offline where the properties essential for profound love can be more reliably detected. This subsequent offline relationship should not eliminate online communication between the two—on the contrary, such communication may reveal significant information about each other. Harmful integration between online and offline dating occurs when, together with the offline relationship, each person also continues his activities on dating sites, in order to further examine other possible candidates. Continuing to use online dating services is a major cause of failing to achieve profound love, as it is very difficult to maintain a long-term committed loving relationship when available romantic options are easier to explore. Persistent and active searches for the perfect partner constitutes a major threat to achieving long-term profound love. So  continuing to use dating sites after such a site has provided you with a suitable candidate has a significant negative impact upon the likelihood of developing profound love with that or any other candidate. To sum up: These online dating sites are excellent tools for locating possible romantic candidates but are of much less useful or effective in establishing long-term profound love.

5abf0669-19b5-4e72-bc03-4d24bed4fab0,Andy Murray feeling much better after straight-sets win at US Open,News,Southend Standard,"Andy Murray made a special request to play Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci later so he could rest his weary legs and the British number one conserved energy on court too with a comfortable straight-sets victory. 
 
Murray survived two draining opening encounters against Nick Kyrgios and Adrian Mannarino in Flushing Meadows but his 6-3 6-2 7-5 win over Bellucci to reach the last 16 was far more comfortable. 
 
Sealing progress in a brisk two hours and 11 minutes, Murray can rest up ahead of the second week, which starts against South Africa's Kevin Anderson and could follow with Stan Wawrinka, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. 
 
Murray's was the last match on, playing under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium, and the Scot was thankful for the extra hours to recover from both fatigue and a niggling bout of cold. 
 
""I just asked if I could play slightly later rather than first or second,"" Murray said. 
 
""Today I felt much better. I slept during the day yesterday two or three times. 
 
""Today I got up, and I slept again before coming out to the courts. I felt much, much better. My voice feels like normal again. 
 
""It's still dull obviously, but it feels more normal today and not blocked up or anything any more, which is good."" 
 
Murray showed few signs of weakness, breaking Bellucci's serve five times during the match and dropping his own just once, early in the first set. 
 
The Scot was typically tenacious in his defence and too quick in attack as Bellucci struggled to cope with his opponent's touch and creativity. 
 
""I felt like I played well,"" Murray said. 
 
""In these conditions, it's a bit easier to control the ball. The ball was not bouncing as high. It was a bit flatter. 
 
""In the conditions the other day, when you tried to flatten the ball out, it was quite easy for it to sail on you. 
   Promoted stories   
""It was harder to serve today. It was much slower conditions to serve in so there were less aces but then obviously returning's a little bit easier, as well. 
 
""So I felt like I played well. But the conditions helped that, too."" 
 
Murray boasts a strong record against Anderson having won five of their previous six encounters, including a straight-sets win in the final at Queen's in June. 
 
The big-serving South African has never made it past the third round in New York but is in good form after winning the Winston-Salem Open last week and beating highly-rated Austrian Dominic Thiem in round three. 
 
""I played some good matches against him in the past,"" Murray said. 
 
""I only lost to him once in Montreal. It was a very quick, easy match. 
 
""I lost to him there but apart from that, I've normally played quite well against him.

1:15 p.m. 
 
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says he understands the frustrations of teachers, parents and others as educators in the state's largest school district strike. 
 
The Democrat said in a statement Wednesday that the state needs an ""educational system that is adequately funded and provides the fair pay teachers deserve."" 
 
The state Supreme Court has said lawmakers have failed to adequately fund education for 1 million schoolchildren. Justices are fining the state $100,000 a day until it comes up with a fix. 
 
The walkout is the first in the district in three decades and comes as teachers, who have gone six years without a cost-of-living pay raise, complain that Seattle's booming tech economy has rapidly increased living expenses.

9:59 a.m. 
 
The head of the nation's largest teachers union says ""all eyes are on Seattle right now"" as educators walk the picket lines. 
 
Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, said Seattle teachers are fighting for reasonable testing policies, a fair discipline policy and securing the tools they need to do their jobs. 
 
Garcia says those are ""issues that every educator in the country is grappling with right now."" She says that if teachers gain traction in Seattle, they will give hope to other educators nationwide. 
 
The strike in Washington's largest school district affects about 53,000 students. Both sides are far apart on pay raises, teacher evaluations and the length of the school day. 
 
The Seattle School Board voted Tuesday night to authorize the superintendent to take legal action against striking teachers.

Teachers in Seattle are on the picket lines on what was supposed to be the first day of school after last-minute contract negotiations broke down. 
 
The strike in Washington state's largest school district began Wednesday and sent parents scrambling to find alternative options, including working from home or signing up for other programs. 
 
The district serves about 53,000 students. Members of the Seattle Education Association, which represents about 5,000 teachers and support staff, planned to picket all 97 schools in Seattle. 
 
Amanda Poch, a 31-year-old kindergarten teacher at West Seattle Elementary, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" that the talks broke down. 
 
She pieced together picket signs that said ""Fair Contract Now"" and ""On Strike,"" saying, ""We'll hold out as long as it takes.""",395,"SEATTLE — The latest on the strike by public-school teachers in Seattle (all times local): 1:15 p.m. Washington Gov.

489707bd-b714-4cd3-a312-953a70d303fa,ICAC laws withstand High Court scrutiny (AAP),News,Yahoo! News Australia,"Retrospective laws introduced in NSW to urgently shore up previous findings from the state's corruption watchdog have survived a constitutional challenge brought by rich-lister Travers Duncan. 

The mining mogul has been engaged in a legal battle with the ICAC since 2013, when then-commissioner David Ipp declared him, and a number of other businessmen and former politicians, corrupt over dealings relating to the Mount Penny coal tenement in the NSW Bylong Valley. 

When the High Court ruled the ICAC had overstepped its jurisdictional bounds in the case of high-ranking NSW prosecutor Margaret Cunneen SC, Mr Duncan decided to follow suit and elevate his case. 

The High Court ruling cast doubt on other previous ICAC decisions and this prompted NSW Premier Mike Baird to rush retrospective laws through the parliament to affirm all commission findings that pre-dated the Cunneen decision. 

Mr Duncan took his matter to the High Court arguing the Baird government's ICAC validation laws were unconstitutional because they amounted to a direction to the courts. 

But in a unanimous decision handed down on Wednesday, the High Court rejected Mr Duncan's challenge and ordered he pay costs. 

A joint judgment from Chief Justice Robert French, Justice Susan Kiefel, Justice Virginia Bell and Justice Patrick Keane described Mr Duncan's construction of the validation laws as ""distinctly implausible"". 

It is expected Mr Duncan will now continue with a Court of Appeal challenge to the ICAC's 2013 corruption findings. 

But Wednesday's decision is a win for the premier. 

This week Mr Baird introduced another bill to allow the ICAC to recover from the Cunneen decision, by effecting review recommendations made by a team led by former High Court chief justice Murray Gleeson and respected silk Bruce McClintock SC. 

""Previous findings of corruption by ICAC should, and will, stand, despite the decision in Cunneen,"" Mr Baird told AAP in a statement. 

""Yesterday, I introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the Gleeson review panel, including an expansion of the ICAC's jurisdiction to investigate corrupt conduct by non-public officials, in strictly defined circumstances. 

""We will not tolerate corruption in this state, end of story."" 

That legislation - which is expected to pass parliament with Labor's support - empowers the ICAC to investigate corruption allegations involving ordinary members of the public where their conduct could ""impair public confidence in public administration"". 

But that right to investigate private individuals would only be triggered in circumstances involving specific criminal acts, like collusive tendering for government contracts or fraudulently obtaining government mining leases. 

Greens MP Jamie Duncan hoped Wednesday's decision would encourage the government to go a step further by introducing statutory provisions covering misconduct, bribery and corruption in public office. 

""The community will be relieved that the corrupt actions of the rich and powerful cannot be airbrushed by repeated court action. Millionaires are still subject to the laws of parliament,"" Mr Parker told AAP in a statement.",478,"Retrospective laws introduced in NSW to urgently shore up previous findings from the state's corruption watchdog have survived a constitutional challenge brought by rich-lister Travers Duncan.

: That is true without any evidence at all; but what about how many cases like this actually get covered under current law?

80e42b7e-1dcf-4891-b97b-301bf614bf2a,G20 vows transparency on rate moves as global growth disappoints,News,Yahoo!Xtra,"ANKARA (Reuters) - World financial leaders will agree to calibrate and communicate monetary policy carefully to avoid triggering capital flight, but will not call an expected Federal Reserve rate rise a risk to growth, a draft communique showed on Friday. 

Many emerging market economies are concerned that when the U.S. Federal Reserve raises borrowing costs, investors will withdraw from other markets and buy dollar assets, leading to the depreciation of emerging market currencies. 

Officials from emerging markets wanted the communique from finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of 20 biggest economies to say that such a rate rise in the U.S. now would be a risk to growth. 

But the draft avoids such wording. 

""We note that in line with the improving economic outlook monetary policy tightening is more likely in some advanced economies,"" the draft communique, seen by Reuters, said. 

""We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our actions to minimize negative spillovers, mitigate uncertainty and promote transparency,"" said the draft, which may yet change before it is finally agreed on Saturday. 

The text welcomed strengthening activity in some economies but said that global growth fell short of expectations. 

The draft indirectly also addressed the devaluation by China of its renminbi currency in August, in a sign the move was not seen as a competitive devaluation to prop up Chinese exports. 

""We reiterate our commitment to move toward more market determined exchange rate systems and exchange rate flexibility to reflect underlying fundamentals, and avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments. We will refrain from competitive devaluations and resist all forms of protectionism,"" it said.

""In August last year we had 6,259 downloads and at the same time this year we achieved 9,940. This really does go to show just how popular eBooks are becoming among library users of all ages. 

""For anyone who hasn't tried eBooks yet, they have exactly the same content as the paper versions but in a digital format. 

""A great advantage is that readers can borrow an eBook on any mobile device, computer or tablet, anytime, anywhere, 24/7. 

""We now have over 10,000 eBook and eAudiobook titles to choose from, and our catalogue is increasing all the time. 

""Our website includes easy-to-follow instructions for downloading eBooks, and if you haven't got the right software, you can even download that for free, too."" 

EBooks are a convenient and useful complement to traditional books. When these are not available or practical, eBooks offer an alternative for instant access to reading. The adjustable text size and lighting options of eBooks are easily accessible for anyone with a visual impairment and helpful for reluctant readers. 

The titles available cover a wide range of fiction and non-fiction, such as mystery, thrillers, travel, humour, romance, science fiction and self-improvement. 

Library members can borrow up to six eBooks at a time and can choose to keep them for seven, 14 or 21 days. 

Unlike traditional books, there is no need to remember to return eBooks. The file simply becomes inactive at the end of the loan period, which means no more fines for overdue books. 

Although eBooks cannot be renewed in the same way as traditional books, people can simply borrow them again at the end of their chosen loan period, as long as no one else has reserved them. 

Julie added: ""If you're not already a member of the library, you can join online at any time of the day or night, or at any of our 74 libraries during opening hours.""

Smith football team withstood an early turnover and limited Kentucky State to only 56 yards rushing while intercepting three Thorobred passes en route to a 38-14 road win at Alumni Stadium in Frankfort, Ky.
On the first JCSU drive, the offense struggled to get going, as Kentucky State recorded a sack on first down and two plays later, Herbin's pass was picked off by KSU's Nathan Robinson.  On the first Thorobred drive, KSU also fell victim to the interception, as JCSU's Dave Mann (Atlanta, Ga.) stepped in front of an Ora Johnson pass, giving JCSU the ball at their own 40 yard line.  On the first play of the new drive, Kentucky State's Raymond Malone scooped up a JCSU fumble and raced 44 yards for the touchdown.  The point after attempt was good, staking KSU to the early 7-0 lead at the 12:38 mark.
The Golden Bulls would respond quickly.  Following a 45 yard kickoff return by Carlo Thomas (East Orange, N.J.), JCSU's Tromecio Summers (Charlotte, N.C.) ripped off a 39 yard rush to take it to the KSU 7 yard line.  Playing in his first collegiate game, Harold Herbin (Fayetteville, N.C.) had a bootleg rush to the KSU one yard line, he punched it in for the first touchdown of his career.  Erik Amaya (Kannapolis, N.C.) knocked in the point after attempt was good to tie it at 7-7 at the 10:52 mark in the first quarter.
Amaya would then put JCSU on top 10-7 when he converted a career-long  41 yard field goal at the 6:51 mark following a KSU turnover.
On the first play of the second quarter, JCSU's Javard Gaines (Newark, N.J.) broke through to block the KSU punt, returning it to the KSU 16.  Five plays later, Herbin found junior receiver Roderick Carter (Miami, Fla.) in the corner for an 11-yard touchdown strike.  Amaya's PAT boosted the JCSU lead to 17-7.
The Golden Bulls would add another touchdown in the second quarter, this time from freshman running back Desean Binyard (Winston-Salem, N.C.), when he pushed through for a one yard score.  Amaya again added the extra point to push the lead to 24-7.
Neither team was able to get much offense going in the third quarter, but KSU struck at the 6:50 mark.  With JCSU pinned deep in their own territory, KSU's Malone stepped in front of an errant Herbin pass, scoring from three yards out.  The successful point after attempt cut the JCSU lead to 24-14.
JCSU struck on it's first drive of the fourth quarter when Herbin found Bryan Chambers for a 12-yard touchdown strike, boosting the lead to 31-14.
Kentucky State would embark on a promising drive, but the JCSU defense stiffened and forced a 49-field goal attempt.  JCSU safety Keith Darnell blasted through the KSU line to block the attempt, then scooped the ball and took it 53 yards for a touchdown, extending the JCSU lead to 38-14.
On the next KSU possession, JCSU's Alfred Mickle picked off a wobbling Ora Johnson pass to seal the game.  JCSU would go on to melt the clock, taking the 38-14 road win.
Offensively, JCSU rushed for 132 yards, getting 55 from Summers and 42 from Binyard.  On the receiving end, Carter hauled in in four passes for 31 yards and one score.  Fred Scott (Stone Mountain, Ga.) caught one pass for a game-long 28 yards.
Defensively, the Golden Bulls were led by Carlo Thomas' five tackles, four of which were unassisted.  Thomas also had one interception and a pass breakup.  Senior Linebacker Austin Jacques (Springdale, Md.) had four tackles with one being for loss.  Defensive lineman Jamaal Tutt (Atlanta, Ga.) recorded four tackles on the day and had one sack for a 16 yard loss.  Travon Leake-Anderson (Richmond, Va.) and Brice Smith (Atlanta, Ga.) also recorded sacks for JCSU in the win.  All told, the JCSU defense had eight tackles for loss and forced four KSU turnovers on the afternoon while limiting the Thorobreds to only 132 yards of total offense on the afternoon.
The Golden Bulls will remain on the road next week,  travelling  to Morehouse on Saturday, Sept. 19 for a 7:00 p.m. tilt against the Maroon Tigers.

1ee0e62a-dd91-4684-831d-597c09ceb67b,Chico family raises awareness for childhood cancer month,News,KRCR-TV,".  -  
A Chico family, personally affected by childhood cancer, is on a mission to raise awareness about the disease. 

Every year, more than 15,000 children under the age of 21 are diagnosed with some type of cancer, according to the American Childhood Cancer Organization. However, monetary support can be limited for these families. 

""The whole family is fighting cancer, not just the kid,"" Kira Evans explained. 

Evans is the mother of Kingsley, a 7-year-old fighting juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer. He was diagnosed in April of 2014, but doctors believe he was born with it. 

""Well I noticed something was wrong at 18 months,"" Evans said. ""He was screaming in pain and holding his leg. At first, his pediatrician thought it was a growing paint."" 

Far from a growing pain, now, the family spends most Fridays driving down to U.C. Davis Medical Center for treatment of Kingsley. 

Currently undergoing three types of chemotherapy, doctors tell the family his tumor is down only 20 percent, but they believe the cancer cells are dead. 

""It takes a big toll on a family,"" Evans said. ""Financially, mentally, emotionally."" 

But they're not letting this break them. Driving around Chico, you may have seen Kira's van, with writing in paint on the windows, reading ""I go gold for my son"" and ""#TeamKing."" It's Evans way of raising awareness this month. 

September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, represented by the color gold. 

""I want everybody to go gold like they go pink for breast cancer,"" Evans said.  

On the other side of the van, more hashtags like ""#MoreThan4,"" referencing the lack of funding to childhood cancer from the National Cancer Institute. It leaves parents of sick kids responsible for footing thousands of dollars in medical bills.  

""It needs to be more of a national priority,"" Evans explained. ""They only receive four percent of federal funding for cancer."" 

The money could help sponsor more treatments that might literally be the difference between life and death for the thousands of kids battling cancer, like Kingsley.  

As for the ""fighter,"" as his mom calls him, Kingsley has a check-up at the end of this month to see how the tumor is responding to chemo and what the next step's will be. 

""He's doing great,"" Evans said. ""You would never know.""  

Though they go out of the area for treatment, Evans said they receive support locally from a non-profit called ""Wings of Eagles.""

59ee3507-50e0-4d43-93c9-db974ba53ac7,Marijuana tax hol saves growers,News,Brisbane Courier-Mail,"COLORADO'S marijuana growers were the big winners when the state suspended new recreational pot taxes for a day, a tax quirk that saved shoppers some sales tax but saved wholesalers tens of thousands. PROMPTED by a quirk in state tax law, the one-day tax suspension allowed growers to transfer a month or more of inventory without paying 15 per cent excise taxes, or $US300 ($A418.32) a pound.

At Colorado Harvest Company, a chain of dispensaries in the Denver area, owner Tim Cullen saved $US45,000 - before even opening his doors to the first customer.

Looking over a small tangle of pot shoppers in his suburban Denver shop, Cullen said the crowds weren't huge but the tax break would be a big win anyway.

""This is just gravy,"" Cullen said about the shoppers.

The odd tax waiver was triggered almost two years ago, when Colorado voters approved two taxes on recreational marijuana - a 10 per cent sales tax for shoppers and a 15 per cent excise tax for wholesale growers.

Ahead of that vote, state tax analysts miscalculated overall state revenue for 2014. The error triggered a mandatory suspension of the new pot taxes.

Lawmakers decided to waive the taxes only for a single day, though voters will have to return to polls in November to authorise the state to keep about $US50 million ($A69.72 million) in pot taxes collected in 2014.

Confused? So were many shoppers Wednesday - but they loaded up on lower-cost weed anyway.

""Lower taxes are always better. Who's going to complain about that?"" asked Benjamin DelCarpio of Centennial, who was queuing early at a dispensary that offered half-price weed to their earliest shoppers.

Some out-of-state visitors were shocked to see the virtually tax-free sale of weed. (It was still subject to local taxes and Colorado's basic 2.9 per cent sales tax.)

""I saw online there was some kind of loophole on the taxes, so I had to come buy some,"" said David Illig of Onawa, Iowa, who was passing through on a drive to California.

Colorado tracks marijuana sales, but it doesn't make the data public, making it impossible to know if Wednesday set a single-day sales record. Several retailers said the day was akin to a busy holiday weekend.

A fiscal analysis prepared for state lawmakers earlier this year predicted that pot growers would use the tax holiday to transfer a month of more of marijuana supply. They estimated a one-day suspension would cost the state between $US3 million and $US4 million in lost taxes - an estimate the state marijuana regulators declined to update.

Still, shoppers and marijuana industry workers lauded the tax holiday as a needed break.

In a statewide tally made final Tuesday, Colorado reported that it collected much more in marijuana-specific taxes last fiscal year than alcohol-specific taxes.

""The cannabis community has brought so much money to the state of Colorado, this is only fair,"" said Chad Drew, sales manager at Colorado Harvest Co.",494,"COLORADO'S marijuana growers were the big winners when the state suspended new recreational pot taxes for a day, a tax quirk that saved shoppers some sales tax but saved wholesalers tens of thousands.

baf247eb-8cc6-4f20-9687-be41919d46ec,Buhari Must Keep His Promise To Reflect Federal Character With His Remaining Appointments By Dr. Wumi Akintide,News,Sahara Reporters,"I am amazed that Buhari in hindsight did not anticipate or envisage that his initial appointments as president would be trailed and greeted by controversy that are bound to suck some oxygen out of his change agenda  for Nigeria. I fault him not so much his lethargy, but for his insensitivity given his track record as a former military dictator. 
 
I went back to read his Chatham House speech in London where he assured the International community he has learnt his lessons and he is not going to repeat the same things he did as a military dictator, when he deliberately tilted the balance in favor of the North with some of his actions and some of the choices made in his name by few of his overzealous aides who wanted to be more Roman Catholic than the Pope. 
 
I am amazed that a man who gave those assurances in London could return back home to start making appointments that clearly remind a cross section of Nigerians about some of the things he did wrong for the 20 months he and Tunde Idiagbon ruled Nigeria with an iron fist. 
 
I caution all of you reading this not to get me wrong. Buhari and his regime did a few things right in 1985, but he also made a few serious mistakes, which Nigerians believed he was going to correct if he was given a second chance 30 years later. But we all forget what clinical psychologists like Professor Ozodi Osuji know and understand: human beings don’t change that easily. Human beings in that context are pretty much like a leopard. The observation is even more pertinent when that human being is over 70 and already fixed in his ways, as an old soldier who never dies but simply fades away. 
 
I recall trying to persuade a professor friend of mine in New York and a chieftain of NADECO whose name I would not divulge in this confession. I was trying to persuade him to support Buhari for president at a time he was running low at the polls for failing to produce his school certificate. 
 
The professor told me no: he did not trust Buhari because of his track record. I pressed him further on why he felt that way about the only man I thought could save Nigeria. The professor gave me three good reasons that left me scratching my head, as I had no ready-made answers to each of the reasons he gave. The professor told me that human beings don’t change that easily. If Buhari did something bad before, he well might do it again. 
 
I left the professor feeling a bit disappointed and disillusioned about Buhari, but I felt convinced in my heart he was a better candidate than Jonathan, and I was going to stick with him. I kept repeating to myself as I drove away that Buhari is going to change, because he would be a fool not to. 
 
The day I saw Femi Fani-Kayode’s analysis of the implication of the first 37 appointments Buhari made, I could not help but remember what my learned friend had told me. To add insult to an injury, the same day somebody sent me video of a young Yoruba man who spoke a mixture of English and Yoruba in a 30 minutes video sent to me on WhatsApp. The young man eloquently spoke about his own views about what is going on in Nigeria without appearing to take any particular side. 
 
I watched the video 3 times to make some sense out of it and I realized the same video must have been sent to millions of Nigerians like me. I became very restless after hearing the stuff because the young man did not strike me as a rabble rouser or a politician trying to cut corners like Fani Kayode. I picked up my phone and I called my professor friend to tell him I wanted to share the video with him. 
 
The professor, a Yoruba man like me, repeated the same predictions he had given me in our previous conversation as follows: When Buhari took over power in 1985 from Shehu Shagari, a fellow Fulani man, he decided to detain Shagari in the comfort of his own house in Sokoto, while he put his Deputy or spare-tire Vice President Alex Ekwueme into a maximum security prison for close to 5 years on spurious charges. 
 
Buhari, according to him, then pounced on frontline politicians from the South, including individuals like Governor Bisi Onabanjo, Governor Lateef Kayode Jakande, Ebenezer Babatope, Governor Adekunle Ajasin and Chief Reuben Faseide Fashoranti—even Joshua Oladimeji Tuki, my favorite uncle. He also detained many of their colleagues from the Southeast and the South/South. 
 
He tried some of them in some kangaroo courts, and he put some of them in jail or detention without trial. He let most of their colleagues from the North walk away scot-free. That, according to him, was how Buhari gave Babangida and his cohorts a reason to dethrone the Buhari regime in 1985. One of the first things Babangida regime did so was to release those detainees and grant clemency to those already in jail. 
 
The professor added that Buhari issued a decree against drug-dealing and money-laundering that targeted more southerners than the northerners. The aide-de-camp Major Jokolo, son of the then-Emir of Gwandu, presumably using his authority and influence, went to the Murtala Aiport to clear 52 boxes filled with foreign currency from the Nigerian Customs and Immigration without anyone lifting a finger. 
 
The professor repeated to me he would never trust Buhari for those reasons. I knew from that point I must leave the professor alone and go talk to some other people who did not have as much grouse against Buhari. I told my new recruits that Buhari might have made a few mistakes in the past without going into specifics and I got all of them persuaded to support Buhari. I cited Buhari’s war against corruption and indiscipline in Nigeria and his pronouncement to kill corruption before corruption kills Nigeria. 
 
You all can then imagine my joy or euphoria when Buhari won convincingly on March 28 and when his APC won again on April 11. I was glued to my television in New York as I watched him take his oath of office at the Eagle Plaza in Abuja on May 29. 
 
I had expected him to make a few announcements with his inaugural address, just like Nasir El Rufai and his Deputy of Kaduna State had done. I was not expecting him to solve all Nigerian problems in one fell swoop, but I was expecting him to do some of the things he had the power to do without any confirmation hearing from the legislature. 
 
His inaugural address was low key, as far as I am concerned. The only memorable thing he said was, “I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody.” I waited for another 4 to 6 weeks expecting him to do something dramatic to actually prove himself as an agent of change. When I did not see him do that, I was among the first columnists in the social media to call him “President Go Slow” in one of my articles carried by Chatafrik, SaharaReporters, and Facebook. I was also among the first to predict that when Nigerians get to know the details of what President Jonathan and his ministers stole, they would be less forgiving of the man because the guy was just terrible. 
 
If the truth must be told, I believe that President Buhari has done a lot that deserve our commendation. Massive theft at the NNPC has been radically reduced because most Nigerians now know that the fear of Buhari, like the fear of God, has now become the beginning of wisdom. Nigerians instinctively know that the new sheriff in town is quite different from the Ali Baba and his 40 thieves he has replaced. 
 
If Buhari’s predecessors in that office had done half the things Buhari has done, Nigeria would not be in the kind of mess she has now found herself. I would be the first to admit that, and I am proud of him for that. I, nonetheless, still have my reservation on some of what Buhari has not done, and some of what he has done. 
 
The most egregious of all is his apparent lack of sensitivity to the need to reflect federal character in his first 40 appointments. Morning shows the day as boyhood shows manhood. We live in a country where tribal rivalry runs deep and rightly so, because of pervasive poverty and our lopsided level of development in terms of education and civilization between the North and the Southern states. 
 
Many Nigerians forget that if it were left to Ogbuefi Nnamdi Azikiwe and Obafemi Awolowo alone, the East and the Western regions had wanted Nigeria to be the first country in the West African sub-region to get independence from Britain on January 31, 1957, clearly a few months before Ghana got her independence with Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah as the foremost pan-Africanist. 
 
The Constitutional Conference at Lancaster House in London changed that calculus because the least educated among the three premiers did not go along with the arguments put forward by his learned colleagues. He simply told the British, as a wise and courageous leader, that the North was not ready and won’t be ready for another 3 years or more. 
 
That Nigeria got her independence on October 1st 1960 was the brainchild of Sardauna Bello. He led the northern delegation to that conference and he made a big difference in that conference. 
 
Ahmadu Bello returned home to engage on a massive and draconian policy of the “northernization” of the Public Service of the North because he did not want a Nigeria in which the northerners were going to be enslaved by the Igbos and the Yorubas of the South. He knew there were minorities in both the North and the South who needed to be reckoned with and catered for but Sardauna focused like a laser beam on making the North competitive with the South and he clearly won that debate arms down. He told the British and anybody who listened that when he became the leader of Government Business around 1948 there were only 23 northerners in the senior cadre of the Northern Nigeria Public Service. 
 
The rest of the positions were taken by the Igbos and a few Yorubas from Ogbomosho area only because the Yorubas as a rule do not like to leave home if they can help it. The Igbos, on the other hand, were traders by occupation and like the Jews, they have more of their people living outside than those living at home. Up till tomorrow and despite a very costly and painful civil war, there are more Igbos living in the urban towns of the North, and the West and the South/South. The Igbos left Rivers Port Harcourt, Ikwere, Ogoni, and Okrika in droves during the Biafran war. Today they are back in full force. Akure, the Ondo State capita,l which happens to be my hometown, is as good an Igbo city like Onitsha, Ifite Oraifite, and Umuahia Ubeku to mention a few. 
 
Sardauna Bello was therefore right to pursue his “Northernization” policy, which preferred to give jobs on contract to Indians, Egyptians, Pakistanis, and Lebanese, while turning down Igbos and Yorubas who applied to do the same jobs. Sardauna refused to budge. He started an aggressive policy of having more northerners trained and educated in overseas institutions.  As the northerners return home after their studies, they all began to take over all of the positions offered on contract to foreigners. The fallout from that policy saw the College of Arts and Science in Zaria becoming a full-fledged university, which now bears the name of Ahmadu Bello and rightly so. 
 
When you see individual northerners like Lamido Sanusi, late Abubakar Rimi. Jerry Gana, Professor Yadudu, Nasir El Rufai, Ahmed Joda, Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, Gambo Gubio, and so many of them speak English with eloquence and authority, you will understand that the North has come a long way due in large part to the great vision and leadership of Ahmadu Bello. The South did not fold up its arms waiting for the North to catch up, so Buhari cannot tell us he cannot find educated and qualified southerners to take some of the jobs he has now filled with northerners.  I traveled quite a bit around Nigeria in my role as Secretary to the National Council of Education of Nigeria and as Secretary Staff Development   of the Manpower Department of Nigeria so I know what I am talking about. 
 
When the history of this Republic is written, the name of Ahmadu Bello shall be written in gold for what he did to make the North competitive with the South. He did a lot more than that. He made sure that all the military bases in Nigeria were all located in the North and he made the Military the Civil Service of the northerners. That was how the northerners at one point in our history and even up till now still dominate the officer rank of our Military and the rank and file as we speak. 
 
Ahmadu Bello did not stop at that. He made the  Hausa language the “lingua franca” of the military. Who says that Sarduana Bello has not made a difference in Nigeria? Today the ragtag army of Boko Haram has managed to take the battle to the heavily-armed Nigerian troops for more than 6 years, in close to half of the country in land mass. The whole of the Northeast, including Sambisa Forest, is almost taken over by Boko Haram. Now Boko Haram has moved the headquarters of the military back to the North so they could be closer to the Northeast. So Nigeria is back again to the status quo of the northern domination of the Nigerian Armed Forces, as speculated in some quarters in the South. Buhari ordered the movement for a perfectly legit reason but people can read different meaning to what he has done and if their concerns are not addressed in the nick of time, the perception could lead to future problems. 
 
I go into all of these details to show how tribal rivalry runs deep in Nigeria  and how each of the three dominant tribes jealously guard whatever edge they already have and can kill to have any tribe take away that advantage for whatever reason. 
 
If you are still wondering why Nigeria for all the efforts she has made cannot yet conduct a realistic census or afford to let Nigerians have a social security or identity card like they do in America, you can take this point as one of the drawbacks to that move. Some are scared that such a move might let the Nigerian Government know how many mouths it is feeding. 
 
It is not in the interest of the North to let Nigeria have a realistic Census because if it does, the creation of 19 states in the North and 17 in the South might become indefensible and unjustified. The creation of 776 Local Governments with the lion share of them going to the North might become absurd and totally indefensible. That is why it is wrong to compare Nigeria with Singapore under Lee Kuan Yu, like Buhari said he wanted to do. Singapore does not have the same kinds of problems, like mutual suspicion, that Nigeria has to grapple with. 
 
Buhari tilting the balance of his initial appointments to the North is therefore viewed in the South as an abomination, if not a security threat, because it is going to further put the South at a clear disadvantage when compared to the North. When Obasanjo decided to decentralize the military bases from the North to the South, he by that single stroke had made it impossible for northerners to easily stage a coup in Kaduna or any part of the North and to get their colleagues elsewhere across the country to challenge them because they do not have the wherewithal to resist such a coup, so they go along to get along. End of story. 
 
If Obasanjo had consulted with the northerners before making the move they probably would have shot it down.  Say what you want about Obasanjo, the man was a tough cookie, like Sardauna Bello who passionately loved Nigeria and took some steps to do what he considered to be the best interest of Nigeria and its stability. 
 
I recall Major Okah when he announced his failed coup on radio and television, and Lt. General Alani Akinrinade announced that his command was not going to obey. If Buhari now reverses the Obasanjo’s decentralization of the military bases in Nigeria to send all of the military bases back again to the North, you can be sure that the Southerners are not going to view such a decision favorably because such a move is going to tilt the balance of power back again to the “status quo ante bellum.” It is that simple. 
 
Buhari picked 75 percent of his initial appointments from the North and only 25 percent from the South. That is something to be viewed with some suspicion. That is why there has been a groundswell of resistance against what Buhari has done. Yes, we know that the less than 50 appointments constitute a tip of the iceberg because there are many more appointments left to be made. The South knows that for a fact, but it also knows the 50 appointments are among the most strategic appointments that can easily upset the apple if push comes to shove. 
 
The Head of State and Commander-in-Chief is from the North. All of the service chiefs are from the North. The individuals come from different political zones in the North, but what unites them all is the Hausa Language, which Sardauna Bello insist had to be included in the curriculum of all the schools in the old North because he knew the value of language as a weapon of indoctrination even better than his counterparts or peers in the South. 
 
The Chief Justice of Nigeria is from the North. The President of the Court of Appeal is from the North. The Director of DSS, which is the equivalent of the director of the CIA in America, and the Security Adviser are all now from the South. The Inspector-General of Police is from the North. The Head of Customs and Immigration are all from the North.  The President of the Senate is from the North, the Speaker of the House is also from the North. The Secretary to the Government and the Accountant-General and the Auditor-General are all from the North. Tell me what is left? 
 
If you have worked in Government or Public Service for as long as I have done, you will understand that Buhari has pretty much pushed the North in charge of everything that matters, just like it used to be for all of the 38 years the military in particular was in charge in Nigeria. That is why some southerners are having some sleepless nights about what Buhari has done with those appointments, and that is why Femi Fani-Kayode, like “Osiun” Ado and “Osiun Oye,” cannot be dismissed as talking garbage or rubbish. The young man has a point. 
 
Yes, you can argue that President Jonathan pretty much did the same thing for the 6 years he was president, but what he did with the military are not half as draconian as what Buhari has just done, and all he could tell the South is to be patient. No, the South is not going to be patient. The South is doing precisely what Sardauna Bello did when he bluntly told Azikiwe and Awolowo that the North was not ready for Nigeria to become independent until the North was ready. 
 
It would have been unthinkable for the South, with all its educational advantage over and above the North, to just keep quiet and let it go. That would be nothing short of suicide. If the North can momentarily put itself in the shoes of the South, it would understand what we are talking about. 
 
The North would never have tolerated or condoned that kind of imbalance against it. That is the blunt truth. 
 
The only consolation the South can take away the inferno of a controversy is the assurance by Buhari that he is going to seriously reflect federal character in making the remaining appointments and will take a second look at the first 50 appointments he has made with a view to assuring the people that he is going to be fair to all and sensitive in the way and manner he conducts himself as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. 
 
Those who argue that he has a right to choose only the people he can trust are right to say that, but I must also remind them that when you are president, you are supposed to know and find people in the other parts of the country who can best appointed to such positions if needed. The Constitution expects every president to do that, and that is why the Constitution insists the president must win in at least 2/3 of the states and win no less than 25 percent of the votes in all of them to have the spread to be declared a winner. 
 
Buhari would not have become President if he had only won in the 3 political zones of the North. He won because he won in 4 out of the 6 geopolitical zones and because he secured more than the required 25% vote in 2/3 of the states including the Federal territory. 
 
He cannot now argue that he did not know enough people he could easily have tapped for appointment if the push comes to shove. If he could identify with the Igbos during the campaign by wearing their national dress or costume, he should be able to find Igbo supporters of his party or another party that he could appoint into any of the positions, since the Constitution requires the President to give to them as integral parts of Nigeria. That is the bottom line. 
 
I still believe that Buhari despite all his shortcomings articulated in this write-up, is still the best candidate to have won the last election. I understand why he has imposed a litmus test for those he would like to appoint. I support him on that but I also like to remind him that he himself may not pass his own litmus test, if we dig deeper into his past. 
 
There are a few transgressions that can and could be forgiven or overlooked because none of us is perfect. The seriousness of the offenses committed should be a determinant for the punishment given. You cannot simply equate somebody who has stolen 1000.00 naira with someone who has stolen 100 million or a trillion naira. 
 
Yes, the Law would call both of them thieves but the one who stole 1000.00 Naira would receive a lesser punishment than the one who stole several millions and trillions. If both of them are forced to refund back to government the money they have stolen, the one that stole the millions and trillions would feel the pinch more. 
 
I hope Buhari would let Nigerians know the level or degree of the culpability of those he wants to try for looting our Treasury. I hope the court or the process would let us know how much they have stolen. By the same token, Buhari ought to let us know the reasons why he has refused to appoint some of the individuals in his own party like Amaechi, like Fashola, and so many others he may have been forced to drop. 
 
We do know that some of them have sacrificed much to help him win the presidency. Some of them bank-rolled his campaign, potentially from some of their loot. If Buhari receives the stolen good, he is as guilty before the Law as the person who stole the goods to begin with. Nigerians need all of those details because those who seek equity must also come in with clean hands. Let Nigerians make that determination or judgment is all I am saying. 
 
I cannot wait to see Buhari keep his promise to more adequately reflect federal character in all his remaining appointments from now on. Need I say more? 
 
I rest my case.",4102,"I am amazed that Buhari in hindsight did not anticipate or envisage that his initial appointments as president would be trailed and greeted by controversy that are bound to suck some oxygen out of his change agenda for Nigeria.

6c4c1e38-a702-45cb-9a10-1f8ce3c88fa5,Donald Trump slams Marco Rubio as just a ‘kid’,News,949 KCMO,"WASHINGTON () – Donald Trump slammed rival GOP presidential contender Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during an interview Thursday with CNN, calling the 44-year-old just a “kid.” 

“Marco Rubio, he’s like a kid. He shouldn’t be running in this race as far as I’m concerned,” the 69-year-old Trump said. 

Trump also disparaged Rubio’s public service, claiming he doesn’t do anything but sit at a desk. 

“Marco Rubio sits behind a desk; sometimes and he reads stuff, he’s in committees so you know that’s all he does. I create jobs all day long,” Trump told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on “New Day.” 

“Believe me, I’ll know more about this than all of them put together,” Trump said. “If Marco Rubio’s good, how come we’re doing so badly? He’s a sitting U.S. senator so why doesn’t he do something about it? I’m not in government, he is in government. “ 

Trump’s fire comes after Rubio knocked Trump on Tuesday, suggesting the businessman is not prepared to take the helm as commander-in-chief. 

“I think that the most important thing a president will ever do is provide for the national security of our country, and I think up to now, he hasn’t really answered serious questions about national security,” Rubio said on Fox News. “Until he does, there should be serious concerns, not just about him but about any candidate that’s not able to speak in detail, with clarity and with seriousness, about the national security threats that we face.” 

Trump first took aim at Rubio — who is ascendent in polls following a strong performance in last week’s CNN debate — during a Tuesday night tweet, then again on Wednesday, during an appearance in South Carolina. 

“I mean, Marco Rubio, as an example. He’s got no money, zero. Now, I think that’s OK, (but) … I mean, he’s got nothing,” said Trump, speaking before the Greater Charleston Business Alliance at a joint event with the South Carolina African-American Chamber of Commerce in North Charleston. 

Trump — who is often mocked for his own signature coif — even went after Rubio’s hair. 

“(Rubio) announced he was going to run because he’s overly ambitious, too young — and I have better hair than he does, right?” Trump said to cheers from the crowd. 

But Trump told CNN on Thursday when it comes to foreign policy, he prefers to be “unpredictable” over revealing how he would address top national security issues like the threat of ISIS and U.S. military interventions in Iraq and Syria. He also slammed President Barack Obama for giving the U.S.’s enemies too much insight into U.S. policies. 

“I don’t want the other side to know what my views are, where I’m coming from,” Trump said. “You’ve got to be cool and you’ve got to be unpredictable.” 

Trump also mocked Obama for publicizing ISIS successes.

Rain fell in parts of the the West Valley Sunday night and the National Weather Service said parts of the Phoenix area could experience 40 mph winds and small hail as storms move in from the southwest. 

Buckeye, Goodyear and Maricopa were among the Phoenix-area cities getting rainfall. 

A   flood and significant weather advisory was issued Sunday night by the National Weather Service for the southwest part of Maricopa County. 

A blowing dust advisory issued  for parts of the Valley and northern Pinal County expired at 8 p.m. 

The Gila Bend area was put under a flood advisory Sunday evening with rain expected to cause areas of State Route 85 to be flooded, according to the NWS. 

There is a 40 to 50 percent that the storms in the southwest Valley will move into other parts of the region, according to the NWS.

92f35927-d7eb-49a4-a28d-e49d3fce41b2,"Pope Francis: Before one can know what is moral, he must know what is true",News,CO2 Science,"By Dr. Craig D. Idso, Chairman 
Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change 
 
As predicted in an article I wrote last week published in The Federalist , Pope Francis is making climate change a signature issue during his visit to the United States. This morning, in remarks presented at the White House, Pope Francis commenced his U.S. tour by proclaiming ""climate change is a problem that can no longer be left to a future generation,"" thereafter complimenting the Obama Administration for the policy prescription it advocates in addressing the issue (i.e., reducing CO 2 emissions). 
 
However, as noted in my Federalist piece, neither the Pope's concerns, nor the Administration's alarms, over potential global warming are based upon the best available science. The biosphere is not spiraling downward toward planetary Armageddon and policies designed to deal with the subject are, quite frankly, nothing more than a recipe for social and economic disorder and disaster. And in support of this position, our Center is releasing today a massive new report exposing the pathetic house of cards upon which the entire global warming movement is founded -- global climate model predictions. 
 
The new report, titled Mathematical Models vs. Real-World Data: Which Best Predicts Earth's Climatic Future? , presents a thorough and careful scrutiny of hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific publications evaluating the accuracy and capability of climate models to simulate the response of a number of important climatic phenomena to rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations.  In short, this treatise provides the proverbial look under the hood of the inner workings of today's state-of-the-art climate models that provide the basis for both the Pope's and the Obama Administration's belief that global warming is a problem and that something must be done about it.  And that ""look"" is not encouraging. 
 
In brief, our report present the results of a thorough and careful scrutiny of the scientific literature that evaluates model credibility as it pertains to a number of important climatic phenomena. First of all, pouring over some 33 original scientific studies of the subject, along with 34 of their relevant citations of other such studies -- all of which 67 publications are listed in the Reference section of our document's initial chapter on Clouds -- we encounter 188 major documented errors , inadequacies or shortcomings in all of the carefully evaluated ""hindcasts"" of the several climate models therein reviewed, which modelling failures the authors of the 33 original studies acknowledge as still remaining in the most up-to-date climate models that include the many significant impacts of clouds in their projections of both past and future climate characteristics. And in light of this sad state of affairs, one can only presume that this negative aspect of the quest to successfully predict how earth's climate will evolve over the next several decades will likely not be achieved anytime soon ... or maybe not even at all. 
 
In the second chapter on ENSO -- i.e., the El Niño Southern Oscillation -- we review 31 other original papers related to this phenomenon; and we include in the chapter's reference list 68 additional citations to still other pertinent studies, which have proven invaluable in revealing 203 different inadequacies in climate model hindcasts , which host of negative findings seriously questions the validity of current climate model projections that have been made in relation to this important climatic phenomenon. 
 
In a closely related third chapter on Monsoons , we review the findings of 43 other original scientific studies, as well as report the major findings of an additional 82 studies that were cited by the first set of studies, while identifying in this process 326 different ways in which current climate models have failed to accurately represent the major documented characteristics of monsoons of prior years. 
 
In the fourth chapter, we repeat this process for Oceans by reviewing the findings of 33 pertinent original publications and 84 other studies therein cited, which together highlight a total of 263 climate model errors and/or shortcomings related to the roles of earth's seas in influencing global climate change. 
 
In the fifth and much-shorter chapter on much-less-studied Permafrost , we describe the findings of 13 pertinent papers that reveal a total of 23 climate model errors. 
 
In the sixth and rather large chapter on Precipitation , we review the findings of fully 73 original scientific papers and 130 other studies that they cite, all of which are found to be plagued by a total of 518 climate model prediction failures. 
 
In the seventh chapter on Radiation , we review the findings of a much smaller set of 22 original studies plus 4 others that they cite, which together reveal a total of 49 climate model prediction problems. 
 
In the eighth chapter on Sea Ice , we review the findings of a still smaller set of 11 original studies plus 14 others that are cited by them, which together produce a total of 73 climate model prediction problems. 
 
In the ninth chapter on Soil Moisture , we review the findings of only 6 original studies along with those of 10 other studies they cite, which when combined reveal a total of 40 major model biases. 
 
Last of all, in the tenth and largest chapter on an assortment of Miscellaneous Phenomena , we review the findings of 98 original investigations together with those of 148 additional studies cited in the 98 original studies, which when combined together reveal a total of 735 climate model prediction problems. 
 
Altogether, therefore, we find (and document) a total of 2,418 failures of today's top-tier climate models to accurately hindcast a whole host of climatological phenomena. And with this extremely poor record of success, one must greatly wonder how it is that anyone would believe what the climate models of today project about earth's climate of tomorrow , i.e., a few decades to a century or more from now. 
 
In concluding, therefore, it would seem to be the height of folly to place any faith (attention Pope Francis) whatsoever in the predictions of even the very best of today's most up-to-date climate models, regarding the thermal status of a future atmospheric-CO 2 -enriched world.

As if Trump's concern about Americans living up-rotation lifestyles still hasn´t changed things beyond trying / failing financially would he call upon them every step along those slippery paths? Indeed precisely so: there really simply do NOT appear anywhere within Canada without substantial restrictions both existing regulations governing Canadian greenhouse gas emission rates are strong — including what we see today when measured viscount increase below 80 mb/yr.

I asked Pope Francis what he meant by the American job market, which did not benefit the US but is still pushing hard to reduce emissions. ""Our field or even our classrooms will stay cell phones addicted. And, unfortunately, not inventions,"" he said"," we have seen with our national energy security — both on Earth Day here two weeks ago but this Monday— there was never any doubt or justification behind their approach under either Vice President Joe Biden or Secretary Ryan; all three were aware of these challenges ahead when they met today… With regard: what role will Hillary Clinton play playing her part? There has been very little public conversation suggesting Mrs Trump make efforts before reaching out nationally–at least not publicly –to address global warming … My position within government requires me also to focus my energies now more highly upon pressing issues relating directly-in opposition [sic] only unto those relevant specifically so long as such effort brings about significant consequences which may outweigh current costs.""

3f90d41e-9fc1-4caf-9d39-2f4d23d5e28f,Work ongoing to boost the performance of The Castle theatre in Wellingborough,News,Northamptonshire Telegraph,"Bosses at a town theatre are looking to continue their work to offer more to visitors both on and off the stage. 

		 
The Castle theatre in Wellingborough sold more than 71,000 tickets to events in 2014-15, an increase of 1,340 on the previous year. 

It also saw an increase in the number of professional artistic events, community events, and functions, business and private events held there. 

			 
The figures were contained in a report on the theatre’s performance discussed by members of Wellingborough Council’s partnerships and performance committee this week. 



 
It covered the theatre’s performance at the end of the financial year 2014-15, activity in the first months of 2015-16 and a forecast for the second half of the financial year. 

Among the highlights was last year’s Christmas show, Pinocchio, which saw more than 75 young people from the borough involved in the show alongside the professional cast and the highest public ticket sales for a Christmas show to date. 

The comedy programme is going from strength to strength, with acts including Lee Evans, Josh Widdicombe and Alan Carr driving sell-out audiences. 

Contemporary dance is another area which the theatre would like to expand, and they have secured specific funding streams to support dance development. 

			 
However, the commerical trading side of the business, the bar, cafe and functions, saw a decrease in sales of about £16,000 in 2014-15. 

This has mostly been attributed to a continued decline in daytime sales, and while the sale of alcohol and non-hot beverages in the evenings has grown, it is not as high as they felt it should be. 

A report by director of The Castle (Wellingborough) Ltd Darren Walter said they had to ‘take definitive action on the bar and cafe trading’ so they have been working with Tom Hewer Enterprises to take over the running of the bar and cafe and open a new on-site restaurant, Franks Hamburger House. 

Mr Hewer already has several restaurants in Northampton and recently opened a new one in Towcester. 

			 
It is hoped the new initiative will mean the commercial trading operation returns to what it should be. 

But while they wait to see how it goes, pre-sales for the theatre’s Autumn season are looking strong and classes are now at an all-time high in terms of number of classes, participants and revenue generated by it. 

The Christmas show, A Christmas Carol, is also ahead on like-for-like sales of last year’s Pinocchio and the theatre has launched its new Business Club as part of its 20th anniversary celebrations. 

Looking ahead, Mr Walter’s report states: “We have been informed our revenue grant from Wellingborough Borough Council is being reduced by a further 15 per cent next year (in addition to the 15 per cent cut this year). 

“We have been working throughout this year to develop proposals for finding a sustainable way for arts and culture in the borough to survive and thrive in the borough. 

			 
“A key part of this has been the commissioning of a feasibility study to address both the venue’s needs, its options for the future and the business plan that needs to underpin any developments.”",521,"Bosses at a town theatre are looking to continue their work to offer more to visitors both on and off the stage.

Protection of the whole theatre' revenue

St. Hugh's Theatre in Lisbon, which operates at St. Hughs, has been sold 60,000 tickets in a five day period starting in the latter part of 2014 for about £15,000. But it has also delivered more opera its members (large numbers of about 35,000)"," day last Wednesday for two performances which they said provided ""good news"" about what was yet still left out during one or many days back when most people would likely be talking over each other that season with only limited information from local officials as well As things stand now however public contracts remain not quite right (unlike before!) whether it is possible have increased competition such as ticket pricing through different venue operators
What can we expect?  New production schedule A change will follow where these projects finished because I did feel very confident those should see better opportunities too soon but even then my fears seemed unfounded so long live next project! Let's hope nothing changes until everything does 🙂 But why wait till after December 2012 here... In February 2013 all contract updates went according plan including new locations along three routes: We don't know how much money could come up budgetly without further funding just like any future industry event had costs increasing throughout November /December - Budget estimates show 20% decrease, 5 years down payment plus 10"

Matthew Samuels, who is on trial for fraud, told some of the women he met through online dating websites that he was ""one of the richest men in the UK"", according to prosecutors. 
 
The Crown has claimed instead that Samuels is adept at ""juggling"" relationships ""to obtain money"". 
 
He is accused of conning five women including a wealthy widow and a serving police detective, between 2011 and this summer. 
 
Former public schoolboy Samuels, 50, is also alleged to have cheated his own stepson out of thousands of pounds over what prosecutors claimed was a dodgy car deal. He denies 11 counts of fraud. 
 
His ex-wife Caroline Morris told the court she went bankrupt owing £150,000 after allowing him use of her credit cards and taking out loans. 
 
Ms Morris, from Lichfield, Staffordshire said the couple met at a motor show in Earl's Court, London, in 1992 and they had children. 
 
In 2003 the couple married and Samuels was written into her mortgage, and promptly refinanced the property for £111,000 more. 
 
She claimed her ""A1 credit rating"" was wiped out by her former husband's spending over the next few years, before she ended the relationship in a ""messy"" divorce in 2007. 
 
Ms Morris, mother to seven of his children, said: ""He borrowed on every single credit card I had. I had a (£20,000) M&S loan, I had American Express loan me some money, and almost paid M&S back and had to go bankrupt in  the end."" 
 
By 2011, she and the children were ""living like church mice"" with the burden of debt, she said. 
 
She told Worcester Crown Court she would be paying back an outstanding debt from the period, and added: ""I'm still paying those payments."" 
   Promoted stories   
However, for one period Ms Morris was involved in a what she agreed was ""a three-way relationship"" with her ex-husband and his new female partner, all living under the same roof. 
 
Ms Morris said Samuels had run car dealerships and always believed the money was to fund his businesses. 
 
Gareth Walters, prosecuting, asked her if the relationship ""started to decline"" when she became aware of text messages to Samuels from another woman. 
 
Breaking down, Ms Morris said: ""I knew there was somebody in the background of his life."" 
 
She added: ""I suppose I loved him and wanted him to be with me, and I put up with him."" 
 
Sitting in the dock in a suit and tie, Samuels, who was privately educated at King Edward's in Witley, Surrey, showed no emotion as his ex-wife wiped away her tears. 
 
In cross-examination, Samuels's barrister Abigail Nixon said: ""You agree the credit cards' use was with your permission.  So even if there was £150,000 on your credit cards, that was all done with your knowledge and permission."" 
 
Ms Nixon asked: ""He did pay you back in relation to the the loans?"" 
 
Ms Morris replied: ""To a point and then he couldn't pay any more.  He robbed Peter to pay Paul, borrowed from one to pay another, and then I jumped.  I wish I had jumped sooner."" 
 
The jury also heard from Samuels's sister who claimed he was ""brilliant at business"", likening him to entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. 
 
Deborah Storer said her brother was treated differently by their mother from the other three siblings, being sent to an expensive boarding school and was, as Ms Nixon put it, ""the apple of his mother's eye"". 
 
After an up-and-down relationship, she told the court Samuels rang her with ""wonderful"" news, telling her he had won the EuroMillions lottery, and claimed he would pay off her mortgage. 
 
She told the jury she quit her job and stopped paying her mortgage, based on her brother's news - and later nearly lost her home when the banks foreclosed and no lottery winnings surfaced. 
 
On Tuesday, the jury heard how serving West Mercia Police Detective Nicola Bull was allegedly drawn in by Samuels who is accused of conning her out of almost £12,000. 
 
He is also accused of cheating mother-of-three Anne Ruddock, from Ledbury in Herefordshire, out of £45,000, and Alfreda Roberts, a 78-year-old widow from Ipswich, out of £110,000 of the money her husband left her.

Opening the prosecution, Mr Walters said: ""He has been shown to be adept at juggling a number of relationships simultaneously, the Crown would say using those relationships to obtain money from his partners either with or without their knowledge.""

875184a6-4e08-4ca9-8e53-ce9452b2c20a,Senator: Give Joplin developer time with family before he goes to prison,Blog,The Turner Report,"When Richard Gregg, the former developer of 1717 Marketplace on Rangeline in Joplin is sentenced for bank fraud and bankruptcy fraud a week from today, the best he can hope for is the opportunity to spend some time with his family before he goes to prison.
Gregg has been locked up since his arrest, repeatedly denied bail because authorities alleged he was continuing to commit crimes while behind bars.
Five letters asking the judge to allow Gregg some time with his family before he begins his prison sentence were filed in U. S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today.
Four came from family members, while the fifth was written by Sen. Jay Wasson, R-Nixa.
I have known Rick all my life and have watched his children grow up. I am not writing in defense of his actions as I am not informed in regard to all the circumstances of his charges.I would respectfully ask that you consider giving him some time with his family before he is transported to a facility to begin serving his sentence.
Rick has five children and four beautiful granddaughters. Many of them have not seen him in over a year. I believe his family deserves some time with him in order to begin to deal with the confusion and unresolved feelings which have resulted from his many months of incarceration.
I believe Rick is very remorseful for his past actions and I do not feel that allowing him time with his family would in any way result in risk to the community.
Gregg's son, Trevor Gregg wrote the following:
Judge Wimes, 
No words can express the time that he's spent in jail and the numerous birthdays, events, my wedding, and everyday luxuries that he's missed. He's maintained an unbelievably positive outlook on everything, from wanting to spend more time with his family and trying to make the best of the situation. I know you have to factor in a lot of things when you come up with your decision to allow him some time to spend with his friends and family before continuing his sentence and I truly appreciate you allowing us to write about some of the positive traits of my dad.  Growing up, my brothers and I played sports. We played basketball, baseball, tennis, pretty much anything with a ball. He was always our coach, spending countless hours coaching our teams and practicing with not only his own boys, but the other kids on the team. He took all of us on long trips, sometimes taking other kids with us and paying for them to stay with us, providing food and anything else we all needed and wanted. This was a pattern throughout our young lives and extended into junior high, high school, and college.  My grandparents and my dad’s parents are getting older and may not be with us for an extended period of time. I hope that isn’t the case because they are absolutely incredible people, but I would be saddened if something happened to them before my dad was released. I know that’s a tough way to look at providing my dad some time before he continues his sentence but I hope you take that into consideration. I know he would love to be able to see my mom, his parents, his kids and grandkids. I can tell it hurts him deeply, not seeing his parents and not being able to see his grandkids grow in these ‘character shaping’ years. He’s been there for his kids, his parents, and now grandchildren and I know it would mean the world to all of us and to him to be able to share a little bit of time together before he finishes his time served. His daughter, April Tindall, noted, ""Being in Greene County Jail has humbled him, got him reading the Bible, and not controlling things on his own but leaning on God. It has softened him to realize the important things in life, which his relationship with God, his family, and doing right."" Gregg's crimes are detailed in this April news release from the U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri: A Springfield, Mo., businessman pleaded guilty in federal court today to engaging in fraud schemes, even after he was under indictment and while incarcerated, that totaled more than $3 million in losses.
Richard Thomas Gregg, 59, of Springfield, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge David P. Rush to one count of bank fraud and one count of bankruptcy fraud.
Gregg was the principal shareholder and a director of Southwest Community Bank in Springfield, which failed in May 2010. In the factual basis to his plea agreement, Gregg admitted that the United States could prove he substantially jeopardized the soundness of that financial institution and directly contributed to the failure of the bank. Southwest Community Bank lost $679,399 on Gregg’s personal line of credit and $871,125 on a commercial real estate fraud scheme perpetrated by Gregg, for a total loss of $1,550,524.
Gregg and his wife also were majority shareholders in Glasgow Savings Bank in Glasgow, Mo., which failed in 2012. Prior to Glasgow Savings Bank’s failure, it was one of the oldest operating banks west of the Mississippi River. Gregg was also a real estate developer, an investor and a licensed insurance agent for the Shelter Mutual Insurance Company. Gregg had ownership interest in and controlled a number of business entities.
Under the terms of today’s plea agreement, Gregg will be sentenced to six years and six months in federal prison without parole and must pay $3,098,896 in restitution to the victims of his fraud schemes. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.
Bank Fraud
By pleading guilty today, Gregg admitted he defrauded Great Southern Bank by selling the collateral securing a $2 million loan, and keeping the proceeds. In February 2009, Gregg borrowed $2 million from Great Southern Bank in Springfield, using 160,000 shares of stock for First Bancshares, Inc. (FBSI), the holding company for First Homes Savings Bank, as collateral. Gregg physically deposited the stock certificate with Great Southern Bank. Between May 6, 2009 and June 6, 2009, Gregg devised and executed a scheme to defraud Great Southern Bank, and to obtain securities under the custody and control of Great Southern Bank by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises.
As a part of this scheme, on May 6, 2009, Gregg checked out the original FBSI stock certificate from Great Southern Bank, using as a pretext the stated purpose of separating the large certificate into multiple smaller certificates. At that time, the loan from Great Southern Bank had a balance of $1,511,194. Gregg signed a trust receipt promising to return the stock certificates to the bank within 30 days. Gregg, however, chose not to return the stock certificates to Great Southern Bank and instead used the funds for other purposes. On May 7, 2009, Gregg deposited the collateralized FBSI shares into his account at Scottrade (a privately-owned retail brokerage firm). On May 28, 2009, Gregg borrowed $440,000 from Scottrade, from the margin account on which he used the FBSI stock as collateral.
As a result of Gregg’s fraud, Great Southern Bank consolidated several of his outstanding loans in order to cover the missing collateral. In the end, Great Southern Bank “charged off” $2,316,264 on this consolidated loan. However, the actual value of the FBSI shares, $1,350,400, is the loss directly attributable to the fraud.
Bankruptcy Fraud
While Gregg was already under indictment for bankruptcy fraud relating to the bankruptcy petition of his corporation, 1717 Market Place, LLC, he filed a personal bankruptcy petition that contained numerous false declarations and concealed fraudulent transfers of property.
On March 19, 2013, Gregg filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition. Between Feb. 20, 2013, and Sept. 1, 2014, Gregg devised a scheme to defraud the Bankruptcy Court, the United States Trustee and his creditors. By pleading guilty today, Gregg admitted that his bankruptcy petition contained materially false statements and knowingly omitted material facts. Gregg also admitted that he transferred his property to place that property beyond the reach of the Bankruptcy Court, the United States Trustee and his creditors.
Gregg transferred his interest in two parcels of real estate, a 97.2-acre tract and a 6.4-acre tract in Nixa, Mo. Gregg also filed $250 million in bogus liens on his real and personal property in order to keep them out of the hands of his creditors. Gregg admits that the United States could prove he reported $45,773,834 in unsecured debts to others, which he fraudulently attempted to have discharged in his personal bankruptcy case.
Other Crimes
In addition to the two counts to which he pleaded guilty, Gregg admitted the United States could prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the other conduct alleged in the indictment against him, including two other bank fraud schemes, wire fraud schemes targeting two casinos, and money laundering.
In one bank fraud scheme, in 2008 Gregg defrauded Southwest Community Bank by selling the bank a piece of commercial real estate at 2814 S. Fremont in Springfield for $1,551,9440, when it was worth less than half that amount. Gregg did not disclose to the other bank directors that he had purchased that property for $775,000 a few months earlier, nor did he disclose that two appraisals had been conducted on the property in recent months. One appraisal valued the property at $762,000. The second appraisal was cancelled when Gregg disagreed with the preliminary work. After Gregg cancelled the appraisal, he had the bank order an appraisal of the Fremont property by another appraiser, who valued the property at $1,580,000. Gregg did not disclose to the bank that this appraisal was not an independent valuation of the property, but rather was something Gregg had, in essence, directed.
In another bank fraud scheme, Gregg used collectible automobiles as collateral to obtain loans, then sold the cars without paying back the loans. Gregg admitted that the United States could prove that in January and February 2010 he executed separate but related schemes to defraud Great Southern Bank, Metropolitan National Bank and People’s Bank of the Ozarks. As a part of these schemes, Gregg sold seven collectible automobiles at the Barrett-Jackson Auto Auction in Scottsdale, Ariz. Five of the automobiles were encumbered at the three banks.
Gregg borrowed $400,000 from Great Southern Bank in October 2007, which he secured with four collectible automobiles, including a 2006 Ford GT. Gregg consigned the 2006 Ford GT with the Barrett-Jackson Auto Auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., where on Jan. 23, 2010, the vehicle was sold at auction for approximately $150,000. Gregg chose to not return the proceeds of the sale of the Ford GT ($138,000 after deducting the auctioneer’s fee) to Great Southern Bank and instead used the funds for other purposes. When Gregg defaulted on the loan, Great Southern Bank realized a $129,644 loss.
Also, Gregg borrowed $400,000 from Metropolitan National Bank in 2005. He secured this loan with a “floor plan” financing, meaning the loan was a revolving line of credit made against specific pieces of collateral, in this case automobiles. When each vehicle on the floor plan was sold, the loan advanced against that piece of collateral was to be repaid. This loan was renewed in December 2009. In January 2010, the collateral included a 1971 Chevy Cheyenne Pickup. The portion of the loan’s balance collateralized by the 1971 Chevy Cheyenne Pickup was $17,221. Gregg also consigned the 1971 Chevy Cheyenne Pickup with the Barrett-Jackson Auto Auction, and it was sold for approximately $29,000. Gregg admits the United States could prove he chose to not return the proceeds of the sale ($26,680 after deducting the auctioneer’s fees) to Metropolitan National Bank and instead used the funds for other purposes. When Gregg defaulted on the loan, Metropolitan National Bank realized a $17,221 loss.
Gregg also admits the United States could prove he committed wire fraud related to bounced checks at two Oklahoma casinos. On Jan. 3, 2012 Gregg presented five checks, payable to Buffalo Run Casino in Miami, Okla., each in the amount of $10,000, knowing his credit union account contained insufficient funds to cover those checks. Between Feb. 16 and March 1, 2012, Gregg presented five checks payable to Downstream Casino and Resort in Quapaw, Okla., in the total amount of $60,000, knowing his bank account contained insufficient funds to cover those checks.
Gregg also admits the United States could prove that on Aug. 14, 2012, he filed a substantially fraudulent corporate bankruptcy petition for his company, 1717 Marketplace, LLC, that misrepresented the company’s financial situation to the material detriment of creditors, and concealed more than $9 million in debt owed to the company by insiders, payments he had directed.
Ongoing Criminal Conduct
Some of Gregg’s criminal conduct occurred while he was on bond and while he was incarcerated.
Following his indictment by a federal grand jury on Feb. 28, 2013, Gregg was released on a personal recognizance bond. While he was on bond, Gregg committed substantial, additional criminal offenses, for which the grand jury issued the first superseding indictment on July 23, 2014. The court found that Gregg had violated his conditions of bond by committing federal crimes while on release. The court found that Gregg posed a danger to the community in the form of potential economic harm, and that Gregg was unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release. For those reasons, the court ordered Gregg’s bond revoked and he was incarcerated.
Gregg, through counsel, filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its order. Prior to the hearing, the government obtained and reviewed recordings of Gregg’s telephone conversations and prison visits, preserved on the Greene County Jail’s recording equipment. The recordings revealed that Gregg had conspired with others to commit new crimes from jail. On Nov. 3, 2014, the court issued an order denying the motion to reconsider bond.
On Nov. 4, 2014, the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment, which charged Gregg with additional acts of bankruptcy fraud.",2355,"When Richard Gregg, the former developer of 1717 Marketplace on Rangeline in Joplin is sentenced for bank fraud and bankruptcy fraud a week from today, the best he can hope for is the opportunity to spend some time with his family before he goes to prison.

c7458733-6233-4515-881f-d7c485b8826b,"To Hell With IMF, Says War Veterans Minister Mutsvangwa Adding Cabinet Colleagues Still Think 'Whites Are Superior'",News,Individual.com,"In A sign of confusion in the cabinet linked to the bitter fights over President Robert Mugabe's succession, war veterans minister Chris Mutsvangwa has hit out at finance minister Patrick Chinamasa's pro-IMF strategy. 

The outspoken Mutsvangwa further attacked ""some of ministers in the cabinet (who) still think white man is superior"". 

Mutsvangwa is a key ally of vice president and succession aspirant Emmerson Mnangagwa while Chinamasa is close to the Zanu PF faction opposed to a Mnangagwa presidency. 

And, indicating that the succession question is also impacting efforts to right the country's economy Mutsvangwa effectively accused Chinamasa of treachery by claiming the IMF which the Finance Minister is quoting wants to topple Mugabe. 

""They (IMF) want to remove Mugabe ... they want Tsvangirai to be on the helm,"" Mutsvangwa told a war veterans meeting in Mutare this week. 

Chinamasa has been working hard to get Zimbabwe back into the good graces of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a desperate bid to secure debt relief, new financial support and to improve the country's battered image in the West. 

He has made some progress which is why he reacted with annoyance when Mutsvangwa tried to throw spanners into the works by attacking the IMF at a meeting with a delegation from the institution last week. 

Chinamasa, at the time, called his cabinet colleague to order, reminding him that Zimbabwe was not paying its debts. 

""We owe countries and international financial institutions huge amounts of money, hence we should not politicize the situation,"" said the treasury chief. 

But Mutsvangwa hit back while addressing a provincial war veterans meeting in Mutare recently. 

""Some of ministers in the cabinet still think white man is superior,"" he said. 

""They have the mentality that whatever comes from America is number one; whatever comes from British is first. 

""That's a wrong mentality but I will stand by you. We are the brave of the brave."" 

Mutsvangwa then went for the jugular, effectively accusing Chinamasa of trying to topple Mugabe by working with the IMF. 

""We have nothing to do with IMF because their agenda is removing war veterans from influential positions in government,"" he said. 

""They want security sector reform and they want Tsvangirai to be on the helm of the government. 

""They want to remove Mugabe and war veterans from power because they want access to our wealth."" 

Zimbabwe's economic salvation, Mutsvangwa, stated could only be secured through Mnangangwa's China strategy. 

""There are plans to build a new Harare city and V P Mnangagwa has met the Chinese to discuss the project,"" he said. 

""The matter will be soon taken to cabinet for consideration. It involves links of roads to South Africa as well as links to Beira. This means it's a multibillion dollar investment. 

""Initially capital will be around $5 billion which is not coming from the government but we will use our minerals as a guarantee to Chinese which President Mugabe agreed to. 

""We will call the Canadians and Australians to evaluate our minerals and we pay back the Chinese using our minerals. The new city will generate money to pay back the debt.""",520,"In A sign of confusion in the cabinet linked to the bitter fights over President Robert Mugabe's succession, war veterans minister Chris Mutsvangwa has hit out at finance minister Patrick Chinamasa's pro-IMF strategy.

238e9f70-3ac8-4330-9faf-5d508fdda2ce,South Australian MPs confident of local submarine build under a Turnbull government,News,Wagin Argus,"A greater share of a $50 billion submarine-building program will likely be done in Australia under a Malcolm Turnbull-led government in a major strategic and industrial shift, according to buoyant South Australian MPs. A greater share of a $50 billion submarine-building program will likely be done in Australia under a Malcolm Turnbull-led government in a major strategic and industrial shift, according to buoyant South Australian MPs. Liberal MPs who were facing electoral wipe-out under Tony Abbott in part because of the broken promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide say they are confident Mr Turnbull is more inclined than his predecessor to build the next generation of boats locally.

""In the conversations I've had with him, Malcolm was more receptive to building as much as possible locally than the current PM,"" one South Australian Liberal said on Tuesday morning before Mr Turnbull was sworn in.

South Australian senator Sean Edwards, who extracted the pledge from Tony Abbott for a ""competitive evaluation process"" for the submarine program during the last leadership crisis in February, also expressed confidence.

""From the conversations I've had overnight, there will be more work locally and a big focus on smart industries and advanced manufacturing,"" said Senator Edwards, while stressing he had not spoken personally with Mr Turnbull.

""I've never been more confident about the process than I am today … I'd welcome Christopher Pyne because the role of defence minister is an extremely important one and Christopher has a good track record as an effective operator.""

The Department of Defence is undertaking a ""competitive evaluation process"" to assess bids by Japan, Germany and France to build the new fleet of subs.

Mr Abbott was widely regarded as having favoured a partnership with Japan, which initially meant much of the building work would likely be done in that country.

However he announced the competitive evaluation process amid fears of a major electoral backlash in South Australia because the government had made a pre-election promise to build 12 submarines in Adelaide.

A shift towards doing more building work locally should be manageable because Defence has asked the three bidding countries to prepare a range of options: building locally, building overseas, or a ""hybrid"" build partly onshore and partly offshore.

Reports emerged on Monday night that Education Minister Christopher Pyne, the most senior South Australian Liberal, would shift to the defence portfolio, all but guaranteeing a boost to local building work on the new fleet.

However government sources cast doubt on those reports and suggested Abbott-backer Kevin Andrews may remain in the portfolio.

Mr Andrews said on Tuesday he wanted to remain in the job given the major challenges still facing Defence.

""We're about to bring out a White Paper, we're in the midst of the submarine evaluation, we're in the midst of replacing the navy almost completely over the next decade or so. It takes a long time to get on top of the complexity of Defence and I would be happy to continue in this role,"" Mr Andrews told the ABC.

""I don't think it's good for the security and safety of this country and for the wellbeing of our defence forces to keep changing defence ministers.""

One perceived driver of Mr Abbott's inclination towards Japan was to build a closer strategic relationship with that country – a move that is supported by Washington.

Since then, however, Japan has largely matched Germany and France in saying it was prepared to do much of the building work in Australia. One South Australian MP said he had been ""pleasantly surprised"" by recent conversations with Japanese representatives.

Of course there is a loop hole or two here still with this new change. According to the story, the ability of the embassy of consulate general to take care of the application depends on their other workload — and all applications are considered on a case-by-case basis. If you’re stationed overseas and want to get this process started, you must email the embassy directly and include both the service member’s full name and the full name of the dependent, as well as their date of birth, and proof of active duty status, the story says.

To use the new system, which circumvents the previous central office approval system, service members must have stateside PCS orders relocating them from their overseas duty station.

According to French website TF1.fr, the limited edition hypercar will not be called HyperVeloce as previously reported, but Centenario LP 770-4. The name has been chosen to mark 100 years since the birth of Ferruccio Lamborghini. The company’s founder was born on April 28, 1916.
As the name suggests, the Lamborghini Centenario LP 770-4 will be powered by a 770PS (759hp) version of the naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine also found in the Aventador SV and regular Aventador models. Thanks to the uprated engine and the four-wheel drive system, the anniversary model is said to cover the 0-100 km/h (62 mph) sprint in 2.7 seconds, with a top speed of more than 350 km/h (217 mph).
The Centenario LP 770-4 will be built in a very limited run of 20 units, which will make the Aventador SV (600 units) and Aventador SV Roadster (500 units) look like mass-produced models.
Obviously, the Centenario LP 770-4 will be distinguished from regular Aventadors thanks to a more track-focused aerodynamic package. However, it won’t be as extreme as the Veneno (pictured).
Lamborghini’s hypercar will not only be rare, but expensive as well, with a rumored price of more than €1 million ($1.12 million). The Centenario LP 770-4 is expected to launch in April 2016, just in time to celebrate Ferruccio Lamborghini’s centenary.

dbccf4ea-869a-415c-a0e6-b286828bc55c,Barack Obama promises tough action on China cyber attacks,News,Camden Advertiser,"Obama and Xi face off in Washington 

After six bruising and sometimes humiliating years grappling with the great global challenger, Barack Obama reckons he's learned some lessons. This time, instead of offering to share the global leadership podium, as he did in his first presidential visit to China, Obama is welcoming the Chinese President to Washington with an unambiguous threat.

""There comes a point at which we consider this a core national security threat,"" said Obama, answering a question about cyberattacks from a member of the Pentagon's new cyberwarfare unit, while visiting troops at the US Cyber Command and National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade. If China and others cannot work within acceptable limits, ""we can choose to make this an area of competition, which I guarantee you we'll win if we have to"".

China's President Xi Jinping will be walking into a very different President Obama to the one who began by promising to ""extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist"". It will be a less relaxing conversation than the eight hours they shared in Sunnylands two years ago, when these charismatic leaders were building their rapport.

Between Obama's first China summit in 2009, in Beijing, and what will probably be his last in Washington on Thursday and Friday, he has shed the old humble willingness to give his Chinese counterpart ""face"" at the cost of his own, in the hope of building the trust required to jointly solve the world's most pressing problems. Instead, this encounter of the world's two most powerful men is being framed by grim brinkmanship on both sides.

Xi, as chairman of the Central Military Commission, has just finished building an extraordinary archipelago of artificial islands, which will enable him to defend audacious territorial claims and project military power deep into the South China Sea. US defence leaders have replied with promises of ""fly throughs"" and ""sail throughs"" to puncture China's implicit territorial claims, while warning against militarisation of those islands. THE SUPERPOWER THREE-STAR RATING

1. Chinese cyber attacks:

It's looming as the greatest daylight robbery in global history and the thieves are getting away 

2. China's building fake islands:

Land reclamations in the Spratlys are all done. Nothing can stop airstrips, armaments and ports 

3. Close-in military surveillance:

China has been harassing US spy flights and vessels for 15 years, to no avail 

4. China's human rights crackdown:

Beijing is waging war on Chinese civil society, while the US stands idly by 

5. Regional Institutions:

US fumbled China's infrastructure bank and its own TPP, but has rallied support in ASEAN 

6. Taiwan:

The harder China pushes, the further its dreams of Taiwan's 'liberation' drift away 

7. Making friends in Asia:

The US has never been so popular, China has rarely been so feared 

8. Weaving maritime military alliances:

While China draws closer to Russia, the US weaves alliances with everyone else 

9. Economy:

China's 40-year economic miracle is looking shaky, US recovery is underway 

10. 'Soft' cultural power:

Avengers, Star Wars, Mad Max v ... anti-Japanese propaganda films? 

In July, Chinese intelligence agencies were blamed for the largest publicly acknowledged data heist in cyber history, involving the theft of data from 21.5 million US government personnel files. Obama responded with cyber sanction threats.

A fortnight ago Xi sent his security chief to Washington on a secret mission to placate the Americans with an offer of cyber reassurance, just in time to save their summit. Before doing so, however, Xi sent five PLA Navy ships through the Aleutian Islands, within the 12 nautical mile US territorial zone, just off the coast of Alaska, where Obama happened to be making a visit.

And just in case the subtleties were misinterpreted, last week a senior Chinese military leader made clear that he wasn't interested in only the narrow band of water around Chinese-controlled islands. He wanted the whole maritime expanse from China's southern coast to the tip of Indonesia. ""The South China Sea, as the name indicated, is a sea area. It belongs to China,"" said the commander of China's North Sea Fleet.

Strategists often remind us that this is not the Cold War. They point to the extraordinary breadth of trans-Pacific engagement in terms of people, ideas and money. But such reassurance goes only so far. Strategic uncertainty is rapidly rising. Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama. Photo:  Susan Shirk, who ran the State Department's China desk in the Clinton administration, says Obama's cyber ultimatum shows he is prepared to wear a significant cost to his own interests – including the cancellation of the most important bilateral meeting anywhere in the world this year – to signal his resolve. And this, she notes, is a profound departure from how American presidents have traditionally played the ""summitry"" game.

""Even in the Cold War the US and Soviet Union used summitry to highlight the possibility of avoiding war and co-operating with each other,"" says Shirk, chairwoman of the 21st Century China program at the University of California, San Diego. ""This time, both sides are wanting to show they're willing to risk more tension in the relationship to achieve their objectives, especially in cyber and the South China Sea, and also with economics and human rights. Both sides are signalling firmness and determination, rather than co-operation. And that's really dangerous.""

A lot has been written about Australia's new Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, coming into the job with a more ""nuanced"", ""independent"" or ""soft"" China policy, based mainly on old speeches. But not enough has been said about how China has changed in the intervening years.

Turnbull took the opposition leader's reins late in 2008, in the depths of the global financial crisis, when much of the world was consumed by a mix of awe, fear and giddy admiration for China's seemingly inexorably rising economic power. He lost the leadership in 2009. Hillary Clinton's quip to prime minister Kevin Rudd that year – ""How do you deal toughly with your banker?"" – provides a sense of how the power relativities were being perceived at the time.

Back then, many were convinced China would liberalise its rigid political controls to facilitate the leap to a consumer-driven, services-based modern economy. That model has gone out the window as analysts struggle to explain Xi's sabre-rattling abroad and deepening ideological controls at home. Says Shirk: ""It's mind-boggling to see a personalistic dictatorship re-emerge in China.""

So far, in strategic terms, Xi's muscle-flexing has been counterproductive. He's energised Japan's staunchly nationalist Abe administration, set the rest of China's maritime neighbours on edge and reinforced a web of security relationships around China's great strategic rival, the United States.

Philippine President Benigno Aquino has made comparisons with Nazi Germany. Vietnam has built bridges with its old foe, the United States. And India joined a regional chorus demanding ""freedom of navigation"", backed by ambitious naval exercises with Australia this week, while making the point that the surrounding maritime expanse does not belong to India just because it's called the Indian Ocean. US President Barack Obama (left) and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a press conference at the Great Hall of People in Beijing in 2014. Photo:  In Asia, at least, in this emerging game of strategic competition, China's losses are America's gains.

""They've managed to take long-time complicated relationships for the US and make them into allies,"" the chairman of the US House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes told Fairfax Media in a recent visit.

Over the span of the Obama administration, as the Chinese economy has doubled in size, the US has deepened its ties with every maritime nation in the Indo-Pacific at China's expense, with the exception of the two Koreas. Growing fears of China have fuelled a regional demand for US military engagement that is virtually insatiable. ""If the entire US Navy was stationed in the East China Sea [and] South China Sea the question I would still get [is] 'when is the rebalance going to be real, what more can you send to the region?'"" Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, says.

Perhaps the greatest casualty of China's political muscle-flexing has been the story of an inexorably rising economy, which ultimately underpins all else. Xi's much-touted economic reforms have not eventuated. Ham-fisted efforts to inflate a sharemarket bubble and stop it from deflating have tainted China's policy-making record.

A confidential survey released by Consensus Economics found that economic forecasters believe the Chinese economy grew at 4.3 per cent last quarter, which is a little more than half of the official figure of 7 per cent. If that estimate is roughly right, then America's GDP growth rate might be catching up to China's for the first time in 40 years.

""Has there ever been a better moment to come back to the question how to be tough with your banker?"" says Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.

But just because the balance of power is shifting in Obama's favour doesn't mean he's willing to use it.

As Turnbull receives his military, security and diplomatic briefings over the coming days and weeks he will discover a Canberra bureaucracy that is exasperated with the Obama administration's failings in Asia. He'll find the paradigm of the US pulling Australia away from its long-term strategic interests makes no sense, because it's Canberra that has been doing the pulling. President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California, in 2013. Photo: New York Times The mandarins in Canberra were horrified by Washington's incompetent response to China's Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. They were shocked that Obama sent his trade representative to Hawaii to seal the Trans-Pacific Partnership without room from Congress to negotiate a palatable deal. They were dismayed that the administration could threaten to conduct ""freedom of navigation"" exercises but fail to follow through. Most recently, they suspect Obama will baulk – again – before enforcing his new cyber red lines. Canberra's frustrations stems from its desire for the US to be more effectively engaged, not less.

""This is the worst civilian Asia team we've seen since before World War II,"" says one senior official. ""Secretary of State [John] Kerry is simply not interested in Asia,"" says another. And a third: ""If I'm held hostage somewhere I would hope to God that this [National Security Council] team is not responsible for rescuing me.""

This week the Republican candidates were out-toughing each other, promising to retaliate for Chinese cyber incursions and arguing whether or not to cancel next week's state dinner. Obama confirmed that sanctions were still on the table.

After winning La Liga last season Eder was born two years later than most others thanks not only because Arsène Wenger can't seem as focused after losing him but also due largely owing what became known about an extraordinary run out during World Cup 2008. One wonders how many days it took all eyes off Chelsea manager Diego Simeoneto? As well, some doubts surrounding El Shana if we remember anything good are perhaps overblown (and no wonder those who watched Claudio Ranieri's Real Madrid team were sold within weeks) At other points like these there would need be considerable discussion going back even further into this issue while Chicharito went so far to make sure they did nothing without any kind or justification beyond sheer emotion...

LOS ANGELES -- Chase Utley hit a leadoff homer and added a tiebreaking RBI double in the eighth inning, and the Los Angeles Dodgers snapped their four-game losing streak with a 4-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday night. 
 
Utley's double to the wall in right field drove in Jimmy Rollins, whose bunt single leading off the eighth was Los Angeles' first hit since Utley's homer on Chase Anderson's first pitch. 
 
Corey Seager then added a two-run homer for the Dodgers (86-65), who lowered their magic number for clinching a playoff berth and their third straight NL West title to six. 
 
Paul Goldschmidt homered in his fourth straight game at Dodger Stadium for the Diamondbacks, who easily won the first two games of this series against the inconsistent Dodgers. 
 
Anderson struck out a career-high 10 during six dominant innings, but the Phillies' longtime double-play combo came through for the Dodgers late against David Hernandez (1-5). 
 
Chris Hatcher (3-5) finished the eighth for Los Angeles, and Kenley Jansen closed it out for his 33rd save. 
 
Carlos Frias pitched four innings of one-hit ball in an emergency start for the Dodgers in place of major league ERA leader Zack Greinke, who was scratched with soreness in his calf. Greinke has won five straight starts and 13 of 15 overall, and the Dodgers hadn't won since his previous start last week. 
 
Frias was outstanding in his second appearance after spending two months on the disabled list with a back injury. The rest of the Dodgers' maligned bullpen also provided outstanding work, yielding four hits and never allowing a runner to reach third after Goldschmidt's homer. 
 
Utley put Anderson's first pitch of the game into the bleachers in right field at Dodger Stadium, although A.J. Pollock missed the catch by inches when he leaped at the wall. 
 
The veteran infielder had never hit a leadoff homer in the first 1,575 games of his 13-year career. Utley was the fourth player to hit a leadoff homer for the Dodgers in September, setting a major league record for a calendar month. 
 
Goldschmidt answered with his 31st homer on Frias' first pitch of the second inning. He joined Chad Tracy as the only Arizona players to homer in four straight games at Chavez Ravine. 
 
Anderson mowed down the Dodgers after the first pitch, striking out five straight batters at one point.

9e4d7b9e-f351-453d-bf2d-aa574bd3faa6,"How Pope Francis Clashes With Both Democrats And Republicans, In 1 Graphic",News,WVPE 88.1,"When Pope Francis addresses Congress on Thursday, watch in the background on the C-SPAN feed for some uncomfortable fidgeting. That's because he has plenty of material to make both Democrats and Republicans squirm. 

Since becoming pope in 2013, Francis has made one controversial statement after another on all kinds of, well, controversial topics. On many of these issues, the pope's statements challenge Republican orthodoxy. On some others — abortion and same-sex marriage in particular — the church and this pope are still firmly conservative and unlikely to change doctrines anytime soon. However, even on these, Francis has signaled subtle shifts in the church's attitude. 

Below is a rundown of how the pontiff has challenged both Democrats and Republicans in just two short years. 

Of course, one could argue that these clashes don't matter much. After all, a strong majority of congressional members are not Catholic. Why should they care what stance the pope takes? 

While Francis' speech might make for an ""uncomfortable moment"" as some politicians confront their differences with him, it's unlikely they'll change their views based solely on the pope's statements, said Mark Gray, senior research associate at Georgetown University's Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. 

What's more, he added, that even goes for American Catholics. ""There is not a lot of evidence of American Catholics changing their political attitudes or choices based on the statements of Church leaders,"" Gray said. ""The impact empirically has been weak at best."" 

But the pope is undeniably popular, among both Catholics and non-Catholics — even among people who aren't religious at all. The very fact that people pay attention to him is important, Gray pointed out. ""Among the public, the pope likely has an 'agenda setting' effect,"" he said. ""He can put new issues on the table or elevate issues in the discourse."" 

That means if Pope Francis brings up any topic — be it inequality or abortion — he would give it more oxygen, making it a bigger issue in Congress or on the presidential campaign trail. So even if he doesn't directly change minds, he could meaningfully change the U.S. political conversation.

This highly anticipated match up started with UND scoring first on a 4 play, 51 second drive ending in a 36-yard field goal by kicker Reid Taubenheim. 
 
After a block-in-the-back call on the receiving kick-off, senior quarterback Carson Wentz lead the Bison down the field on a 4:48 minute drive that set up freshman kicker Cam Pederson who nailed a 28-yard field goal through the uprights. 
 
“I think our guys on defense had a chip on their shoulders. We wanted to prove that we were the best defense out there and our guys sure as heck did that,” head coach Chris Kleinman said of the defense in the post-game press conference. 
 
While running the ball is UND’s go-to, the NDSU defense allowed 4 total yards rushing the whole afternoon. 
 
“Now that we did that, allowing 5-yards of rushing next week won’t be good enough,” defensive tackle Nate Tanguay joked after the game. 
 
Bison redshirt freshman wide receiver Darrius Shepherd scored for the Bison, this strike less than a minute into the second quarter. 
 
It was a catch and run 18-yard pass from Carson Wentz followed by a Pederson extra point. 
 
“I saw Carson throw the ball up and I tried to make a play and it worked out,” Shepherd said modestly in the post-game press conference. “It was a really exciting moment.” 
 
At this point, UND was still trying to run the ball rather unsuccessfully.  The men from Grand Forks did not make a first down until late in the third quarter. 
 
Tanguay lead the Bison on defense on the following drive with an unassisted sack on UND quarterback Keaton Studsrud with 13:45 left in the second quarter. 
 
A roaring student section, reaching 100 decibels on the decibel meter, succeeded the hard-hitting tackle. 
 
Freshman wide receiver Rj Urzendowski’s two touchdown catches put an exclamation mark on the drive; it was a 14 yard pass from Wentz and put NDSU up 17-3. 
 
Wentz was 18 for 27 with 262 yards in the air and 4 touchdowns with no interceptions. 
 
In contrast, UND quarterback was 6 for 17 with 57 yards and no touchdowns. 
 
The Bison scored one more time before half on a 22-yard pass and catch Wentz to junior running back Chase Morlock. 
 
At halftime UND had five yards of total offense, to NDSU’s 158 yards. 
 
It took the Bison under seven minutes to score in the third quarter, and it came from a career long 49 yard field goal from Pederson. 
 
The field goal bounced off the crossbar through the uprights as a perfect distance to give the Bison the 27-3 lead. 
 
The fan-voted Play of the Game came with 5:53 left in the third quarter, and it was a Wentz-Urzendowski connection for a diving 38-yard pass into the north end zone for a touchdown. 
 
It was followed by a Pederson extra point making the score 34-3. 
 
UND was the last team to strike on a 1-yard quarterback run from Studsrud.  After an unsuccessful two-point attempt the score was 34-9. 
 
Head coach Bubba Schweigert had this to say about the Bison: “We knew it was going to be a difficult trip down here.  And I thought we played really hard; it was a good effort. “We didn’t establish anything on offense, and you have to be able to do that against North Dakota State.” 
 
The Bison will take a week off and head to South Dakota for the ‘Border Battle’ against South Dakota State in Brookings Oct. 3 at 6 p.m.

2f3e343e-af8d-491e-a7d3-21983be5f795,Andrew Robb trade trip to Indonesia a sign he will survive cabinet reshuffle,News,Daily Liberal,"Trade Minister Andrew Robb is proceeding with a planned trip to Indonesia this weekend in an indication he is confident of retaining his ministerial position despite voting for Tony Abbott in the party room ballot this week. Trade Minister Andrew Robb is proceeding with a planned trip to Indonesia this weekend in an indication he is confident of retaining his ministerial position despite voting for Tony Abbott in the party room ballot this week. The trip comes as it was revealed Indonesian President Joko Widodo has written to Malcolm Turnbull congratulating him on his appointment.

Mr Robb's high-level trip, which will include meetings with his Indonesian counterparts in trade, industry and communications on Monday, comes ahead of the 200-member Australian trade mission the trade minister will lead to Indonesia in November.

""We had planned to go to Indonesia and these plans remain in place until there is any advice to the contrary,"" a spokesman for Mr Robb said.

Mr Robb is widely regarded as an effective trade minister who has successfully negotiated three free trade deals.

His removal is considered unlikely given he has just introduced legislation for the China free trade agreement into Parliament and is working on a similar deal with India.

Mr Robb's visit is intended to continue to bolster the bilateral relationship, which has been bumpy this year following the executions of Bali nine organisers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

Mr Abbott inflamed tensions in Indonesia by linking his pleas for the men's lives with the generosity Australia showed Indonesia in the wake of the 2004 tsunami.

Mr Robb will meet with senior members of the business community and CEOs of leading Indonesian banks in his whirlwind 24-hour visit to Jakarta.

It is likely he will discuss the live cattle trade after Indonesia slashed its import quota from Australia this year, and new growth opportunities.

His trip will focus on shoring up the trade relationship ahead of November's trade mission, which is understood to be the largest ever Australian trade delegation to Indonesia.

The trade minister has placed a high priority on building business to business links between Australia and Indonesia given there are less than 250 Australian companies operating in Indonesia.

Mr Robb told Lateline on Wednesday that he had not voted for Mr Turnbull because of loyalty to Mr Abbott.

""Tony had given me a lot of support after I had a problem with depression several years ago and subsequently with the major responsibilities. He not only did that, but he supported me greatly in terms of fulfilling those ambitions with the three free trade agreements,"" he said.

However he said he had known and respected Mr Turnbull since the mid 1980s, despite a ""year or two which was a little bit frosty"".

""But that's - you know, that's been patched up long ago and I've got enormous respect for him and, you know, I think he will weld the team in a way which will really make us very, very competitive,"" Mr Robb said.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, said Indonesia was ready to work with Australia to enhance bilateral relations based on ""mutual respect and mutual benefit"".

He said Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi already had a close relationship and frequently exchanged SMS texts.

""I think it shows the close relations between the two ministers. There is open communication and I think it is very important,"" Mr Nasir said.

In a Labor Relations Board conducted election today, 23 of the total 25 votes cast among post-production technicians and artists at Deluxe’s Culver City unit on the Sony lot were to join the Motion Picture Editor’s Guild and IATSE. The balloting ended around 5:30 PM Wednesday. There are around 30 post-staffers at the facility. 

As Deadline reported earlier this week, this vote means that Deluxe will have to sit down and work out an agreement with the union for the employees – though no one thinks that’s going to be an easy process with the sharp divisions on both sides on the matter.

“Post-production professionals recognize the value of having a voice at work and today they spoke resoundingly,” said Editor’s Guild National Organizer Rob Callahan tonight after the votes were counted. “Deluxe prides itself on offering world-class post-production talent to its clients, and we look forward to sitting down with the company to negotiate a world-class contract for those employees.” 

Many of the Deluxe employees on the Sony lot used to be health and pension benefits covered staff at Sony Colorworks before it was closed in February. Noticeably non-union friendly Deluxe soon took over the unit in a “semi-exclusive” deal. They then let the staff go and then hired back around half of them as non-unionized employees. 

Today’s vote means its likely back to the future for those employees now.

f6bb2d64-b05d-46ca-8bab-9be251d5539f,Envoy raises $3M for its on-demand senior care service and expands to San Antonio,Blog,TechDiem.com,"As our lives get busier, who will take care of the elderly members of our family? If you’re a fan of the on-demand economy, then Envoy might be just the thing. It’s a family concierge service for seniors and family caregivers, and today it has launched in San Antonio, now making it available in 17 markets across 7 U.S. states. 
 
To support this massive expansion and its operations, Envoy has also raised a $3 million seed round led by SoftTech VC. 
 
Available as a subscription service, Envoy specializes in providing assistance to seniors who need “lightweight help and support.” It’s not meant to replace conventional in-home care, but rather to offer assistance with groceries, personal shopping, running errands, picking up prescriptions, and doing in-home tasks like washing dishes or changing a lightbulb. The idea is to allow seniors to be independent, but give them some support if they need it. 
 From VentureBeat 
  
Envoy has more than 500 Family Concierge assistants who are all connected through their mobile device. The company said that many of them are stay-at-home mothers who are looking for flexible income. And recognizing the importance of safety, Envoy has an acceptance rate of 5 percent of applicants. Many are filtered out through the company’s screening process, background checks, and on-boarding process. It also has a $1 million liability insurance policy in place. 
 
Started by Justin Lin, Envoy solved a problem he had living across the country from his father after losing his mother to cancer. “My father and brother still live on the East Coast, where I grew up,” he said in a release. “My brother was born with a learning disability, so he can’t drive, and with my dad getting up there in age I knew I’d need to get help for them soon. There was no good place for us to turn.” 
 
Besides San Antonio, the company operates in California (San Francisco, Oakland/East Bay, San Jose, Sacramento, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Orange County, Inland Empire, Ventura County, and San Diego), Oregon (Portland), Washington (Seattle), Nevada (Las Vegas), Colorado (Denver), and Arizona (Phoenix). 
 
After coming out of beta a year ago, Envoy has rapidly been tapping new markets, and the new $3 million seed round is expected to help it set up shop in more suburban neighborhoods where seniors live. In addition to commitments from SoftTech VC, the company has received investments from Lowercase Capital, ENIAC Ventures, Structure Capital, Technicolor Ventures, Vayner/RSE, and multiple angel investors. 
 
Envoy is anything but an original idea as it has many competitors with similar services, including Santa Monica-based HomeHero , which has raised $23 million in funding;  Honor , which has $20 million in its coffers; and Care.com , which also focuses on child care. 
 
The company didn’t disclose specific user numbers, but did say that “thousands” of seniors and families have already signed up to use Envoy’s services. It charges based on how many visits per week you’d like: $119 per month for biweekly visits and $199 per month for weekly. Furthermore, regardless of the plan, Envoy charges a 10 percent surcharge for all groceries and other items purchased for the user.

Gold

Gold steadied on Monday, bouncing up from session lows as oil prices rallied and the U.S. dollar fell, after bullion felt earlier pressure on indications the Federal Reserve may still raise interest rates this year, despite recent market turmoil.

Support from rallying oil prices came after spot gold fell 0.7 percent as investors focused on the Fed, which left open the possibility of a September rate rise at a central banking conference at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on the weekend. Several officials, however, indicated that prolonged financial market turmoil might delay such a move.

Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said on Saturday that U.S. inflation was likely to rebound as pressure from the dollar fades, allowing for a gradual rise in rates.

World stock indexes edged lower amid persistent investor concerns about slowing growth in China and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates.

The market is particularly awaiting Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report for August, a key economic indicator.

Hedge funds and money managers more than doubled bullish bets in COMEX gold in the week ended Aug. 25.

3e5d0ca1-f688-4867-ba50-2745414cfc15,Proposed niqab ban could be thin edge of the wedge: Hébert,News,Inside Halton,"MONTREAL — There are no statistics to document how many veiled Muslim women take the oath of citizenship every year in Canada but for many voters, the actual number is irrelevant. 
 

                            On principle a majority of them believe that a face-covering niqab has no place in the citizenship courts of a country committed to gender equality. 
 

                            Conservative Leader Stephen Harper professes to agree and yet over the course of a four-year majority mandate he failed to legislate on the issue in a timely manner. 
 

                            It was only on the very last day of the current Parliament — with the election just around the corner — that the Conservatives got around to introducing a niqab-related bill. 
 

                            Until then the government had embarked on a course that might as well have been programmed to fail the first legal test that came its way. And that has turned the niqab into a political football for Harper and others to kick around in the election campaign. 
 

                            In his days as minister of citizenship and immigration, Jason Kenney had instructed citizenship judges to require the removal of face-covering veils for the taking of the oath. 
 

                            As the government’s own lawyers must have pointed out, that directive conflicted with an existing regulation that gives judges latitude to accommodate religious observance in their citizenship courts. 
 

                            To no one’s surprise, the Federal Court ruled that a regulation could not be undone at the stroke of a ministerial pen. On that basis — and not because the religious rights of the Muslim plaintiff were at stake — the court struck down the Conservative veil ban for the second time last week. 
 

                            If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the government’s appeal of its latest reversal , it will not address whether there is an irreconcilable conflict between the charter-guaranteed freedom of religion and a veil ban because that is simply not at issue in this case. 
 

                            As an aside, if the top court were ever asked to pronounce on whether a veil ban is constitutional, the Conservatives might not like the answer, even if it turned out to be positive. 
 

                            If the principle of gender equality or the secular character of the Canadian state could sustain a policy that requires the removing of the Muslim veil in order to take a citizenship oath, would the same argument not apply to just about any religion-related vestment or accessory? 
 

                            The main consequence of the Conservatives’ efforts to keep their technically flawed case alive by appealing it all the way to the Supreme Court has been to turn the matter into a wedge issue in the election campaign. 
 

                            At is happens, both the Liberals and the New Democrats oppose a ban on veils on constitutional and legal grounds. 
 

                            The Conservatives are not the only party that believes there are points to be scored on the niqab issue. Support for a veil ban runs nowhere higher than in Quebec, the long-standing locale of a debate over the accommodation of religious minorities. 
 

                            In a campaign that has the Bloc Québécois clutching at straws to justify its ongoing presence in Parliament, leader Gilles Duceppe has seized on the fact that the NDP — its main opponent in the election — is offside with the majority of voters on the niqab. 
 

                            Since Bloc-sponsored attack ads came out late last week, NDP campaign signs have been defaced, with the word Islam scrawled across the face of some local Montreal candidates. 
 

                            This may be only the first half of a larger game to be played out — if the Conservatives secure a majority — after the Oct. 19 election. 
 

                            Harper has promised, if he is re-elected, to pass the niqab ban into law. If he wanted to pre-emptively bulletproof such a law from an all-but-certain charter challenge, he could use the notwithstanding clause of the Constitution. 
 

                            It allows governments to shelter a law from the dispositions of the charter for a renewable period of five years. Over its 30-plus years of existence, it has never been used at the federal level. Some Conservative strategists have been shopping for an issue consensual enough to allow their government to break what has become a political taboo. 
 

                            Support for the niqab ban extends well outside the Conservative base. It enjoys the backing of many progressive Canadians, including more than a few feminists. It would be tailor-made for that purpose. 
 

                            Those same strategists believe that once the ice is broken, the use of the notwithstanding clause to suspend the fundamental freedoms that get in the way of the government’s legislative ambitions could eventually become as banal as the now-routine production of catch-all budget bills. 
 

                            From medically assisted suicide to life imprisonment without parole and including supervised injection sites for drug addicts, the list of issues on which the Conservatives could find it convenient to free themselves of an inconvenient charter of rights is an extensive one.",814,"MONTREAL — There are no statistics to document how many veiled Muslim women take the oath of citizenship every year in Canada but for many voters, the actual number is irrelevant.

The scam remained undetected for nearly seven years, Newport Crown Court was told. 
 
The court heard how the 48-year-old mum had ""lived a lie"" but could not see any way out of it. 
 
She illegally claimed £18,785 of Jobseeker's Allowance between 2008 and 2004, prosecutor Byron Broadstock said.

Mr Broadstock told the court: ""It is clear the defendant and her husband lived not a lavish lifestyle, but certainly they had Sky TV and so forth. 
 
""They certainly don't appear to have been in any financial difficulty.""

Justin Evans, for the defence, said £1,060 had already been repaid at a rate of £32.50 a week. 
He said that his client had expressed remorse for her actions.

Still University (ATSU) and Special Olympics Arizona partnered to commemorate 9/11 through Patriot Day, a national day of service, and an opportunity for more than 200 athletes to receive free sports physicals on the Mesa campus. 
 
“We shall never forget. We shall remember this special day – we will keep the events and the tears in our minds, our memory, in our hearts as we carry on,” said ATSU-Arizona School of Health Sciences Dean Randy Danielsen, PhD, PA-C, DFAAPA, during the opening ceremony. 
 
Inducting the opening and closing ceremonies were members from the Mesa Fire and Medical Department Honor Guard & Pipes and Drums, who lead a solemn march in front of hundreds of spectators. 
 
Nearly 400 faculty, staff, students, and community members attended the event, which was directed by ATSU’s Arizona School of Health Sciences’ Jim Farris, PT, PhD, chair, department of physical therapy, and Gerry Keenan, MMS, PA-C, associate professor, department of physician assistant studies. The City of Mesa Police Department and Olympic gold medalist Misty Hyman also attended to show their support. 
 
Athletes from around the Arizona – as far as Payson – made the trip to Mesa for the exclusive Special Olympics Healthy Athletes® event, a health outreach initiative offering health services and information to athletes in need. The event at ATSU marked the first stand-alone Special Olympics Healthy Athletes® event hosted by any medical university nationwide. 
 
“Providing care for Arizona’s wonderful Special Olympics athletes while serving our community on Patriot’s Day, a national day of service, resonates deeply with our University’s mission,” said ATSU President Craig Phelps, DO, ’84. 
 
Under the supervision of faculty and staff, students from ATSU’s Arizona School of Health Sciences, School of Osteopathic Medicine in Arizona, and Arizona School of Dentistry & Oral Health worked together in interdisciplinary teams to provide sports physical examinations to athletes. 
 
“It was incredible to take time as a community to remember of the heroic acts and sacrifices thousands of people made on 9/11,” said first-year athletic training student Luke Beermann. “Then coming together with members of other ATSU programs to provide services to such special individuals with bright, infectious personalities, made the day of service that more memorable.” 
 
Stations included medical history, height and weight, blood pressure evaluations, musculoskeletal testing, orthopedic testing, abdominal examinations, cardio respiratory testing, abdominal evaluations, as well as dental screenings and hearing examinations.

“It was really important for me to be there, and I am really proud to be associated to the University,” said Misty Hyman, spokeswoman of healthy lifestyles and oral health initiatives at ATSU. “There is an important reason why sports are such a great part of our society — it’s because sports are one of the best illustrations of human potential.” 
 
Special Olympics Healthy Athletes ensure participants are fit and healthy to participate in the hundreds of games hosted by Special Olympics Arizona each year. In October, more than 1,000 athletes, partners, and coaches will look forward to the State Fall Games, a statewide competition held at the culmination of each sports season.

THE humble burger bun has stood the test of time since its alleged invention in 1891 by Grandpa Billy and has been filled with an array of meat and veg-based patties ever since. 

The burger has come on leaps and bounds from the simple meat and bread creation and is now feeding the craze for an array of toppings, fillings and variations with a gung-ho ""pile 'em high"" approach. 

You can get the best burger in the UK from Truro's The Hub Box, create your own combos at Mount Hawke's The Old School and go gourmet at St Ives, Blas Burgerworks. 

But lately we've seen new developments between these two bready baps. 
 
Various slow cooked barbeque meats have been stuffed into burgers, adorned with pickles and mustards and eaten with rolled up sleeves. 

Pulled pork has sprung onto nearly every menu across the county and burgers have gone mini with the introduction of sliders for the indecisive types who can't choose what to go for. 

Burger buns are however becoming vessels for much much more than a simple patty; filled with fresh mackerel, pig cheeks or pork porchetta they are diversifying their way from street food to gourmet menu. 

One place that are using their buns for the better is Genki's in St Agnes. 

On Sunday mornings they stuff them with delicious barbeque cooked bacon and monthly they offer freshly caught barbeque mackerel buns, keeping it simple, fresh and absolutely delicious. 

Shellfish Pig, the street food van have also created a delicious mackerel bun offering alongside their unique take on ubiquitous pulled pork with brioche, emmental and   garlic crackling stick, which is really rather   good! 

So what's next for the humble bun? 

I think we will see fresh seafood in a bun growing in popularity, given our fruitful seas with a New England influence, starting with the delicious lobster rolls which has been springing up at various locations across the county from St Ives's Rum and Crab Shack to Padstow's BinTwo. 

Mexican and South American flavours might sway the way our buns are filled – creating every popular taco mash-ups in buns perhaps? 

Or maybe we will stick to our Cornish roots; pasty in a bun anyone?",369,"Comments (0) THE humble burger bun has stood the test of time since its alleged invention in 1891 by Grandpa Billy and has been filled with an array of meat and veg-based patties ever since.

Started at 1:24AM, in a very small area...like all ARSON fires. These poor residents better demand a thorough arson investigation, and the results made public! Many of the more than 400 fires burning all over the west are being deliberately set by eco-terrorists and NWO zealots who both want to rid all rural and forest areas of what they refer to as the ‘human scourge.’ The plan is that after they are burned out by fires set during dry-high wind conditions, to a) foot-drag on restoring water and other utility services, b) withhold well water permits, c) require more stringent environmental permits for any rebuilding, and, worst of all, d) immediately introduce the pack-hunting gray wolves back into those areas to keep people out, which is already being done in many areas of CA, MT, ID, and OR. Google it. And demand a full-scale arson investigation by your local sheriffs… NOT by Cal-Fire, which has been ordered to rubber-stamp all fires as ‘drought-caused.’ But many locals report there being no lightning, seeing suspicious individuals where the fires started, and some of the arsonists have actually been caught—but we don't hear any more about them or their motives. Arson fires only start in a small area, as all of these fires have done. And non-arson fires are RANDOM in terms of their location and frequency, and the causes are immediately discernable. These are anything but random, and although the flashpoint can be determined the ‘natural’ cause cannot. That, along with the shear number of fires occurring all at the same time, points to arson. My point is that there is no talk of the cause of all these fires when that is always the main information provided. ‘Drought’ or ‘global warming’ does not CAUSE a fire, which is all we are hearing, instead of the CAUSES."" * * * PRICE GOUGING, A Letter To Mendocino Sports Plus THANK YOU EVERYONE who sent me info on potential price gouging from area hotels…All of the hotels that were suspected of this were contacted and have corrected their rates.

Angelo, Chief Executive Officer * * * THE FOLLOWING PRESS RELEASE was issued by the Lake County Sheriff's office @ 6:55 pm today: ""On Tuesday, September 15, at approximately 5:00 am, Lake County Sheriff’s Office Patrol Deputies noticed a vehicle approach them, as they were parked at a closed intersection at Bottle Rock Road and Highway 29 in Kelseyville. Both Bottle Rock Road and the section of Highway 29 from Live Oak Dr. were closed to traffic, due to the Valley Fire. Deputies illuminated the vehicle as it came to a stop in front of the road barricade. The deputies approached the vehicle where they noticed a female driver and a male sitting in the back seat, who was not wearing a seatbelt. They observed the male passenger make some suspicious movements, as if he was hiding something from the deputies. They also noticed that he appeared to be extremely nervous and was wearing all black clothing. They identified the male as 26-year-old Royce Sterling Moore of Lakeport. Central Dispatch advised that Moore had two warrants for his arrest and he was immediately detained. Deputies looked into the backseat area and noticed gloves, a black bandana and a backpack in the area where Moore was sitting. Moore admitted that the backpack was his. The deputy picked up the backpack and immediately located what appeared to be a semiautomatic handgun, which was lying underneath the backpack. On closer inspection they noticed that it was actually a BB gun, which Moore admitted was his. The deputy noticed the BB gun was broken and not functional. Moore As the deputy pulled the backpack out of the car, Moore appeared to be extremely nervous and complained about it being searched. A search of the backpack produced pliers, channel locks and a cordless drill with a grinder wheel attachment, which the deputy recognized as being very common burglary tools used in the commission of numerous types of theft. The deputy also located a methamphetamine smoking pipe. Due to the tools being organized in a backpack along with the gloves, bandana and imitation firearm indicates they were possessed as burglary tools. Based on the area where Moore was contacted and his possession of the aforementioned items, the deputies believed he was planning and attempting to burglarize evacuated residents in the Cobb Mountain area. When asked why Moore was being driven up to the Cobb area, he said they were going to check on a friend’s parrot. Moore was arrested for possession of burglary tools, two warrants and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia. He was transported to the Lake County Hill Road Correctional Facility and booked."" (Booking photo of Royce Sterling Moore courtesy of the Lake County Sheriff's office.) CLIPPIES (hippies with clipboards) are collecting signatures in shopping areas around the County to qualify a June 2016 ballot measure that would prevent timber companies from hack-and-squirt tree thinning. The initiative already has a broad base of support, especially among firefighters. Poisoned trees left standing until they collapse a year or two later (if they do collapse) constitute a double fire hazard because they burn rapidly and emit the deadly chemicals used to kill them. The Mendocino Redwood Company maintains hundreds of acres of these upright, highly flammable tree corpses, greatly alarming not only firefighters but residents of the communities bordering the forests. MENDOCINO COUNTY has so far been spared a large-scale fire as they rage to the east and north of us in Lake and Humboldt counties. But if a fire were to break out in areas where non-commercial trees have been killed via hack and squirt, that blaze would that much more quickly become a raging, chemical-fed inferno. THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE is called “Shall the People of Mendocino County Declare Intentionally Killed and Left Standing Trees a Public Nuisance?” Poisoned trees left standing for more than 90 days and that are more than 16 feet tall and within at least 3,200 feet of critical infrastructures such as roads, driveways, fire lanes, significant water sources and telecommunication structures, would be declared a public nuisance under the Mendocino County Public Health, Safety and Welfare code. FORESTS FOREVER, a San Francisco-based environmental group, is gathering the signatures, of which only about 2,500 are needed by January 1st to qualify the initiative for the ballot. The full text of the petition, and a list of places where the petitions can be found is at www.citizensforfiresafeforests.com. MENDOCINO COUNTY UNDERSHERIFF Randy Johnson On Difficulties Recruiting And Retaining Deputies. (Excerpted from his report to the Board of Supervisors, September 8, 2015) “It's difficult to get qualified candidates. Of the qualified candidates you do get there are still a percentage that don't make training, are not ready, for various reasons. And we have some who do fine and then decide after they've been on board for a relatively short period of time that it is not really what they had in mind, it's not what they like, they aren't really interested. We try to talk people into another position, if they say they want to leave. We've already done the background. We want them to remain a county employee and part of our family. But it just doesn't work out for various reasons. We had one gentleman who looked really good, he finished training, was working well, then after a couple of months he decided it wasn't working out, it was too remote for his wife so he quit and went to Santa Barbara. So people will say yes, and give a commitment, and say they want to be there, but… We also understand they are trying to get a job situation. If it doesn't work out for the family— we don't want to separate families, we don't want family issues because they are staying here and the family wants to move somewhere else or for various reasons they need to go somewhere different. We have a person who is from out of state who is interested in the resident post in Covelo that we are excited about. He is going through the process of being certified in California. There may need to be some schooling and classes necessary. Until he has the certificate he is not eligible to apply for the job. Things like that can make the process longer. We have the new deputy-in-training program which allows us to pay people while they are in the academy. If they pass, they come to work for us in some part of the county. That's been helpful but it has the same issues because they may not make training or they get training and then something else comes up. Some of them are military personnel who are on reserve duty. We have not had anyone activated yet, but they are available for duty. It's problematic when reservists are in training because it can make it difficult for them to learn the new job. If they go away for reserve training it can expand their law enforcement training time. The North Coast Sector is just about full now and we're about to fill a resident post on the South Coast. Some recent retirements have cleared the way and improved the budget picture. We're working hard to fill vacant positions before the end of the fiscal year in June. Since we have people back from injury and back on the street recently and we've made a few personnel changes, Deputy Walker has not had to cover Ukiah as much lately and spends more time in Anderson Valley. A few years ago we hired somebody from the big city who had retired and was looking for something where he could slow down a little bit and stay in the community. It started out well but it didn't last very long. Everything was fine here, but he had started a security company after retirement and he left his son to run it and his son was having difficulty with it and there were family issues and he had to leave. He has not been back. The biggest challenge is, it's certainly very isolated and there's not much there [in Covelo]. For instance if they bring a spouse and family it is difficult for them to be long term. It never seems to work out. We might get a recent retiree from another department who wants to slow down and be part of the community. Then they get here and there are all the callouts and they were looking to slow down a little, not be called out on their days off or while they're trying to sleep. Obviously none of us can control that. And there's a lack of activity for them to be involved in generally, so unless they are just going to be totally involved in the community and the job, that makes it very difficult when there's so little to offer. Recent Academy grads are all willing to work wherever because they want a job. Generally it's not a wise business decision for us to put someone fresh out of the academy into a resident post though because they are still learning and they are far from done with training. It's difficult when the supervisors and supportive peers are not around, other than by phone. Then even if that happens they come here — and remember they have passed probation and they get that certificate — it's Have Gun Will Travel because most departments will offer more money than we do and more benefits and they move on somewhere for better benefits and more money. It's well-known in law enforcement that the people we are hiring now are a totally different generation. They look at things totally differently. People ask why we don't do more recruiting and we answer that we get laughed out of the academy because other departments come and recruit and they're offering way more money. They also offer different job conditions and totally different things. When you're a new guy and you are going to the Academy you are looking at one thing: the bottom dollar, how much money you make. They don't look at how they have to commute for an hour or two. They don't look at how much they're going to be on call. Most of our staff has more experience in a year than they could get in most big departments in several years because they handle more kinds of things themselves. They don't call specialists to do work as much. We could offer more money but we will never be able to offer the money to keep people from going to the big dollar departments. We try to make more of a family atmosphere. We take care of their training, their equipment, and we try to include the family in the schedules and be more flexible to try to keep them from going somewhere else. It works sometimes. But you can't change those people who are just looking for the dollars because Mendocino County will never have the kind of dollars to keep people from going to the big cities. When they are just looking at that, it's difficult to compete no matter what you offer. I'd like to see the staff get more bucks to recover from the 10% cut from before. But when you're out fighting against the big agencies with a lot of money— we can offer a beautiful location, we can offer a family atmosphere, we can offer training, equipment, but generally when they're coming out of the academy there looking at one thing, not retirement, but the bottom dollar. How much am I going to get paid? What is my take home? Chasing bad guys is a young man's game. Right now it would be simple to fix the money issues such as reduced pension benefits. But in the long run it will hurt the [law enforcement] industry because people won't want to face bad guys and get attacked and potentially killed for less and less money. As you know one of our officers was killed recently and as we get further away from that it makes it a little easier. But when you see things in the news regularly, there are a lot of wives and mothers who will say they don't want their kids and their husbands going into law enforcement. They will find something else and for the most part they can find other things that pay pretty well and they don't take quite the risk that they take here. They don't get beat up, they don't get shot at, they don't get exposed to all kinds of different things. It's not easy. But we are not in this alone. Even departments with more money to offer experience shortages. They have retirements to fill. But it's harder for the small departments if you can't pay competitive rates. Maybe we can't pay what Sonoma County pays but we can make it enough to where you don't have to drive an hour to Sonoma County. But some will still go there.” SAVING WATER by Jon Spitz As California's epic drought plunges into it's fourth year, Californians are desperately seeking ways to use less water in their daily lives with such measures as taking fewer and shorter showers, flushing less often, turning off the tap while brushing, washing the car less often and replacing lawns with drought tolerant plants being heavily promoted by State water agencies. And according to the State Water Resources Control Board, Californians have heeded this call as household water use was down 28.9% from May 2014 to May 2015. While all these efforts by Californians to conserve water are laudable, household water use accounts for only a small fraction of the water Californians use every day; it is putting food on the table that accounts for most of the water we use. Eighty percent of California's developed water supply is used for agriculture. University of California professor of Agricultural Engineering, Blaine Hanson, published a paper in 2009 in which he quantified how much water was being used to grow California's major crops. According to Dr. Hanson's figures, alfalfa was by far the #1 water intensive crop in California using 5.2 million acre feet/year (1 acre foot = 325,851 US gallons). #2 was pasture at 3.3 million acre feet/year (af/y). Here is the millions of af/y for other major California crops: rice – 2.7, cotton – 2.3, almond/pistachio – 2.1, fruit trees – 2.1, corn – 1.7, grapes – 1.6, subtropical fruit trees – 1.4, grains – 1.0, tomatoes – 0.8, squash – 0.3, dried beans – 0.3. From Dr. Hanson's agricultural water use figures, it is clear that alfalfa and pasture account for a disproportionately large share of California's water use making animal feed by far the largest water user in the State. Seventy percent of California's alfalfa crop is fed to California dairy cows with some exported to China to feed their fledgling dairy industry. Most of the irrigated pasture is forage for dairy and beef cattle. In a 2008 paper entitled, “The water footprint of food,” Arjen Hoekstra, Professor in Water Management at the University of Twente, the Netherlands, estimated on average around the world how many gallons of water it takes to grow one kilogram (2.2 lbs) of various foods. On the low end were lettuce at 15 gallons/kilogram, tomatoes 22 and cabbage 24. In the middle were corn at 107 gallons/kilogram, peaches 142 and avocados 220. At the high end were rice at 403 gallons/kilogram, eggs 573, chicken 815, cheese 896, pork 1,630, butter 2,044 and beef 2,500 to 5,000 gallons. The reason animal foods take so much more water to produce than plant foods is all the water it takes to grow their feed. While the number of gallons of water it takes to produce specific foods varies somewhat from place to place and year to year, it always takes much more water to produce animal foods than plant foods because converting feed crops into meat, dairy and eggs is an inherently inefficient biological process and most of the biomass of the plants is not retained in the animals that eat them. Due to this irreducible biological function, as far as water is concerned, it doesn't matter whether animal foods are produced at a local family farm or at a factory farm far away, they take magnitudes more water to produce than plant foods. Obviously, what this all means is that it takes a lot more water to put animal foods on the table than plant foods. By one estimate a single quarter pound beef patty takes 450 gallons of water to produce in California, the same amount as 45 (or a month and a half's worth of) daily ten gallon showers. While beef is the worst offender, as you can see from the numbers above, all animal foods are high water consumers. A much more effective strategy for cutting down on one's domestic water use than skipping showers is to cut down on the animal foods on one's plate. Even today, some people still believe that they need to eat animal foods to get enough protein, but this fallacy was conclusively debunked long ago by nutritional science. And nutritional science has also proven unequivocally that a whole-foods, plant-based diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds is the only diet to effectively treat and prevent America's most common diseases of diabetes, atherosclerosis and many types of cancer. So not only is eating less animal food and more whole plant food the near-term solution to California's current water shortage, it doubles as the long term solution to ending the scourge of chronic degenerative diseases that plague our country. MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY SEEKS RECERTIFICATION AS A GREEN COMPANY Comments by Betty Lou Whaley, Stakeholder The Rain Forest Alliance (RFA) called a meeting of ‘stakeholders’ to gather information for the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) so that organization can decide whether to recertify Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC). Once certified, MRC wood can be branded as ‘green’ and sold for higher prices at Home Depot. MRC promotes itself as an environmentally sensitive company that uses green methods to grow and harvest their wood; however, they have used the ‘Hack ‘n’ Squirt’ method to poison tan oaks and other hardwoods on their land for many years. After the oaks die, foliar sprays are used to kill the ‘brush,’ thus nothing is left to feed and shelter wildlife. MRC’s forests are situated above our watersheds and as Charlie Acker reminded everyone at the stakeholders meeting, “Water is a forest product.” Eventually all the poisons that have been squirted and sprayed on the forest, along with their metabolites, may seep down into the aquifer. Pesticides must not be considered innocent until proven guilty; we need to enact the precautionary principle and stop all use of all pesticides, before the earth is rendered unfit for all forms of life. MRC should simply cut down their excess oak trees which would keep poisonous herbicides out of the air, the ground, the water, and the people who apply it; this would leave the wood clean and useful for custom furniture, flooring, striated strand-board, pallets, firewood, wine barrels, logs for growing mushrooms, landscaping mulch or biochar. MRC should leave large, mature oaks on every acre and allow native people to gather unpoisoned acorns, which are an important traditional food for them. It is sinful to waste this resource, and lose all the jobs that could and should be based upon it. Killing hardwoods and leaving the dead trees standing, creates an extreme fire hazard, destroys wildlife habitat, wastes the resource, and fails to create jobs in our community; this is the polar opposite of green, sustainable, socially responsible forestry, and therefore the FSC should NOT recertify MRC as a green company. All the timber companies in Mendocino County use Hack ‘n’ Squirt to kill their unwanted trees, and according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, all these companies together have killed 5 million trees in the past three years alone, and left them standing. Thousands of acres of dead standing trees constitute a massive load of fuel—ready and waiting for some accident or lightening strike to set off a toxic and unstoppable firestorm. Despite the obvious fire hazard, Cal Fire only taxes land with ‘habitable structures,’ which garners almost nothing from the timber companies whose actions have set the stage for future firestorms; private homeowners with little land and few (if any) dead trees standing are taxed, and thus forced to subsidize Cal Fire’s firefighting on corporate timberland. In my opinion, Cal Fire must not give timberland owners a free pass on the cost of fighting fires on their own land. Furthermore, volunteer firefighters from community fire departments should not be expected to respond to toxic fires on MRC land. The Grand Jury must investigate this issue of dead trees left standing and who pays for fighting fires on commercial timberland, as well as why Cal Fire urges private homeowners to cut down their dead trees because they are a fire hazard, but does not urge commercial timber companies to do the same. The RFA held a stakeholder’s hearing at the Caspar Community Center on 25 August 2015. The standing-room-only crowd included several of MRC’s neighbors in the Comptche area who stated that their homes are now surrounded by ‘dead zones’ where nothing is able to live; some stated that they can still smell the poisons long after their use, and others claimed that the death rate at early ages from cancer is inordinately high in their neighborhoods. One young mother stated her son was born with leukemia and without a functioning immune system four months after the area around her well was sprayed by four men at night, without her permission. Other women complained of having miscarriages, and at a different meeting, Hack ‘n’ Squirt workers claimed they had children born with cleft palates and missing fingers and toes. Obviously, people in our community are being used as guinea pigs, which is illegal, immoral and downright sociopathic. The poisons being used are considered innocent until proven guilty, which places an undue burden on the public: it is as impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain absolute proof of harm caused by herbicides as it would be for them to finance justice through the courts. The Mendocino County Health Department must investigate these allegations and they should conduct a survey to discover any other problems such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, cancer, birth defects, stillborn babies and miscarriages experienced by residents living near dead forests, as well as by the people hired to hack ‘n’ squirt. A ban on the use of all pesticides is the only sensible course to follow if we want a green, healthy environment where we can safely conceive and give birth to children, raise them, grow gardens, live and work without the fear of being sickened or trapped and burnt alive in toxic wildfires. At the RFA meeting, several people asked for the definition of a ‘green’ company, but the facilitator Dr. Stephen Graddo (the socioeconomic auditor for RFA), appeared not to understand the question. Without official standards, how can any company shape their forest stewardship policy so they can be certified as green? Owners of TPZ land should be required to leave enough food producing plants and sheltering trees and shrubs per acre to provide for the birds and animals that would normally live on an acre in a natural forest. Without a clearly stated set of requirements for certification, RFA and FPC are a sham and their certification is no more than a marketing tool. Another question asked at the meeting was: “Does MRC receive carbon credits for leaving their dead trees standing?” Stephen Graddo, claimed he knew nothing about this despite being the socioeconomic auditor for RFA. Beth Bosk recently claimed (in a letter to the AVA) that MRC gets more carbon credits by leaving their dead trees standing than they would get if they cut them down. If this is true, it is outrageous and makes the whole carbon credit scheme look like a scam. Several attendees complained that Hack ‘n’ Squirt is transforming our natural forests into tree plantations, without filing THPs or EIRs. No stakeholders were pleased with the way MRC treats either the forest or the loggers, who were conspicuous at the meeting by their absence. Someone explained that any logger seen there would be blacklisted and would never work again. This is not how a ‘socially-responsible company’ should act. According to Mendocino County Ag data, there are primarily three poisons used in forest management here: Roundup (active ingredient is glylphosate), Garlon (active ingredient is triclopyr,) which is not registered for use in CA for chemical mowing and possibly other uses as well, and Arsenal (active ingredient is imazapyr). The formulations that are used in the forests include up to 55% ‘inert’ materials, which are often highly toxic. When mixtures are combined, synergistic effects can create even more toxic compounds. Everyone using these formulations claims they are nontoxic and not harmful, however the Safety Data Sheet dated 2015/04/07 for imazapyr states that it has not been tested for genetic or reproductive toxicity, or for carcinogenicity (cancer), or for teratogenicity (birth defects.) It also states: “when thermally decomposed, may release hazardous and/or toxic fumes … Firefighters should be equipped with self-contained positive pressure breathing apparatus and turnout gear … Contain fire fighting water – do not allow it to enter waterways.” The Alligare Imazapyr 4 SL label states: “It is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling … This product may (not) be applied (in CA) on forestry sites with seasonally dry flood plains and transitional areas between upland and lowland sites when no water is present. Also (not) permissible (in CA) to treat marshes, swamps, bogs after water has receded as well as seasonally dry flood deltas.” The Safety Data Sheet for ‘Glyphosate 4 Plus’ states: “Harmful if inhaled, Toxic to aquatic life, have the label with you when calling a doctor. During a fire, product may generating (sic) … toxic gasses. Evacuate area and fight fire from a safe distance. Approach from upwind to avoid hazardous vapors and decomposition products (nitrogen oxides, phosphorous oxides and carbon monoxide). A foam or dry chemical fire extinguishing system is preferred to prevent environmental damage from excessive water run off. If possible, dike and collect water used to fight fire to prevent/minimize run off.” Firefighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus with full face piece. Wear full firefighting turn-out gear (Bunker gear). Roundup, which contains glyphosate, is highly lethal to amphibians in a natural setting. Both glyphosate and herbicides containing it cause genetic damage in laboratory tests with human cells; this year the World Health Organization announced that glyphosate is a probable cause of cancer in humans. The ‘Material Safety Data Sheets’ and the ‘Specimen Labels’ warn of potential health hazards and list first aid treatments; they also warn of environmental hazards. For example the Specimen Label for ‘Forestry Garlon XRT’ warns “This pesticide is toxic to fish…The use of this chemical in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow, may result in groundwater contamination.” Up-to-date copies of these documents for every chemical used must be provided to all local fire and police departments as well as to hospitals, along with maps showing exactly where they have been used. When used as foliar sprays, Arsenal, Roundup and Garlon destroy all the food and shelter for the birds and animals that live in a natural forest. They kill: Ceanothus, Chinquapin, Chamise, Buckthorn, Western Azalea, Coast Live Oak, Toyon, Hazel, California Bay Laurel, Manzanita, Madrone, Alder, Birch, Ash, Willows, Pine, Maples, Red Alder. They also kill huckleberries, thimbleberries, salmonberries, coffeeberries, dwarf Oregon-grapes, elderberries, chokecherry, salal, blackberry vines and many varieties of ferns. Not even wild roses, mosses, and rare fairy orchids are spared: otherwise why would stakeholders describe the sprayed forest as a ‘dead zone’? The callousness of forest managers who plan the destruction of the food sources for all our beautiful native birds is disgusting. Have they never seen a family of handsome, redheaded acorn woodpeckers that depend on acorns but also eat termites, ants and insects in bark and foliage? Without birds to eat the gypsy moths and spruce budworms, won’t MRC then spray insecticides to kill the insects that would otherwise be eaten by birds in a truly green and sustainable environment? Will MRC also use rodenticides to poison the rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, skunks, voles, gophers, mice and wood rats that are the food of eagles, hawks, blue herons and owls? Will the tiny beneficial micorrhizal organisms that live on the roots of oaks, hold water and transfer nutrients to the roots of the conifers die along with the oaks? We have dead zones in the oceans, now we have them in our forests. Despite this mayhem in the MRC forests, the Fisher family wants to brand their company and their forest products as ‘GREEN.’ MRC has killed millions of trees at a time when the earth is heating up, and co2 is building up in the atmosphere. We have great need now for the oxygen that only living trees can make for us. From the viewpoint of this stakeholder, the destruction of the original, natural forest ecosystem is a shameful and heartless crime, and more than a little sociopathic. To certify MRC as a green company and allow them to brand their wood as ‘GREEN’ is fraudulent. The poisoning of trees in Mendocino County forests has been going on for too many years. Forty years ago, in the 1970s, I researched the potential fuel load contained in the thousands of acres of dead standing trees in our county at that time; I wrote a paper on the topic for the Environmental Protection Center (EPC), which we presented at a Board of Forestry meeting in Sacramento. In those days the poison of choice was Agent Orange, that infamous destroyer of Vietnamese forests and rice paddies, which caused serious illnesses in our vets and birth defects in their children and also in the Vietnamese and their children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. As far as I know the Board of Forestry never took any action on this issue. Thousands of acres in Mendocino and Humboldt Counties were sprayed from helicopters, secretly before 1970. The cat was let out of the bag when the wife of Hans Jenny, a soil scientist at U.C., sent a postcard to the EPC, reporting that the Tunzi ranch in Comptche had been sprayed. This was just after Operation Ranch Hand was closed down in Vietnam in 1971. The chemicals used both there and here were a mixture of half 2,4-D, half 2,4,5-T (Agent Orange), highly contaminated with a variety of dioxins. The public was horrified to learn that chemical warfare was being conducted at home in our forests, in our watersheds. Foresters called this practice ‘Conifer Release,’ and it was intended to kill all broad-leaf trees and plants and create a coniferous monoculture. Just like today, it created an enormous load of combustible material, perfect fuel for toxic and unstoppable firestorms. In 1979 an initiative was passed which banned the aerial application of all materials containing any form of dioxin. The legislature quickly invalidated our initiative on the grounds that State law allows phenoxy herbicides to be aerially sprayed, and therefore we citizens could only make laws less stringent, but not more strict than State laws. Unfortunately this demonstrates how our ‘democracy’ has failed us. Should we wish to change State laws using the initiative process, undoubtedly the Federal government would claim the supremacy of their laws over those of the State of California. Our initiative passed in 1979 and 15 years later (in 1994), the Board of Supervisors passed a resolution which stated that thousands of acres with dead standing hardwoods and dead brush killed by Garlon presented an extreme fire danger which threatened the health and safety of thousands of residents. They called for a voluntary halt to this practice, but unfortunately the timber barons ignored this resolution, and the practice has continued, unabated for all of the 21 years that have passed since then. What can be done? Pray for rain and sign the petition put together by Fire Chief Ted Williams to place a measure on the ballot in June of 2016, which if passed will declare it a public nuisance to leave Hack ‘n’ Squirt killed trees standing dead for more than 90 days. Most importantly, try to imagine a toxic-free future: Mendocino County will be declared a Toxic Free Zone. Poisons will no longer be available in chain stores and groceries. Farm and garden supply stores will only carry natural fertilizers – limestone, rock phosphate, compost, seaweed and fish emulsions. Cal-Trans and Mendocino County Department of Public Works will hire people instead of poisons to replace roadside weeds with maintenance-free native grasses and flowers. PG&E will mow beneath their power lines; weeds along railroad beds will be zapped with microwaves. U.C. Farm Advisors will quit pimping for the chemical industry; a new generation of advisors will teach the organic methods of John Jeavons and Alan Chadwick, distribute practical information and help farmers and gardeners solve problems. Advisors will give classes in beekeeping; they will help develop strong races of bees suited to life in our various climates—without any need for chemical ‘assistance.’ U.C. Forestry Advisors will never again promote economic poisons; instead a new generation of advisors will teach methods along the line of the forester-conservationist Richard St. Barbe Baker, who wrote: “Nature is wonderful in her adaptations for she provides a symbiotic fungus whose strands attach themselves at one end to the decaying leaf of the hardwood tree while the other end contacts the tiny feeding roots of the pine. This process is known as a micorrhizal association.” (My Life, My Trees, p. 43) “Moreover, pine woods are inhospitable to birds and wildlife. Lacking browse, deer are liable to bark the trees, and squirrels and grouse destroy the buds. When a pure coniferous forest is artificially created, the balance of nature is disturbed. Birds may forsake the area owing to absence of food and thus permit insect pests to establish themselves unmolested. Insectivorous birds are the friends of both the farmer and the forester and are well known to be important controls of farm and forest insects. (Green Glory, p. 84) ‘Multiple-use’ in Jackson State Forest will no longer be interpreted as a chemically maintained monoculture of coniferous saw logs for Japan or China. A wide variety of native hardwoods will be planted among the conifers. Orchards of fruit trees and groves of nut trees will be planted there, along with berry vines and bushes. Space will be made available in Jackson State Forest for privately owned beehives. Honey wine (mead) will be bottled in our wineries during their off-season. Trails and cabins will be built by groups of supervised young people just as they were in the Woodlands during the Great Depression. Special hardwoods will be grown for furniture makers, and hemp for textiles will be grown in their shade. People will learn to make high-quality, handmade hemp paper and yarn for textiles. Edible and dye mushrooms will be planted, and hand weavers and knitters will become well known for the beautiful colors of their unique mushroom-dyed, handcrafted clothing. Huckleberries and blackberries will be encouraged and will provide fruit for the picking. Kitchens in our schools will be used during the summers for canning classes and people will be able to make jams and pickles there. Bed and breakfast inns will serve their muffins with berry jam and restaurant menus will include cobblers, pies and ice cream, all made from berries grown in Jackson State Forest. Wildlife in Jackson State Forest and on private forestland will not have their homes destroyed by clear-cuts or their food supplies eliminated by herbicides. Venison culled from the forests will be safe to eat. Frogs and other amphibians will not be killed or deformed; sheep and ducks will weed vineyards; pigs, sheep, goats, cattle and poultry will range freely in pastures. Fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, trout, catfish, tilapia, crayfish and abalone will all be farmed organically. These crops will command the highest prices. Restaurants will be proud to serve local organic food and wine, and Mendocino County will become a haven for chemically sensitized casualties from the toxic zones of the world. Tourists will flock here to hike, ride horses and bike along new coastal pathways and on trails in Jackson State Forest; they will enjoy our spas, music and original theater. They will breath clean air, eat our delicious uncontaminated food and sleep soundly in award-winning cabins built of logs, straw bales or rammed earth and heated by the sun. Multiple uses of Jackson State Forest will improve the quality of many lives and strengthen our connections with the natural world. Our schools will teach toxic-free methods of producing the three basics: food, clothing and shelter. With training in these areas, perhaps kids will be able to stay here after graduation and have a future. CATCH OF THE DAY, September 15, 2015 Whipple, Bomia, Graham TINY WHIPPLE, Covelo.

Probation revocation. DONALD TRUMP VS. METALLICA: ONE BORDER DON’T STOP NO SHOW by Lee Ballinger In 2003, Metallica performed in the prison yard at San Quentin. Frontman James Hetfield was uncharacteristically introspective at the mic: “If I didn’t have music in my life it’s quite possible I’d be in here or, not even here, be dead. I’d much rather be alive. Everyone is born good. Everyone’s got the same size soul. So we’re very proud to be in your house and play some music for you.” Six years later, Metallica played in front of 50,000 people at Foro Sol stadium in Mexico City. Their pride in being in someone else’s house to play some music was as heartfelt there as it was at San Quentin, as can be seen on the DVD Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria. But this time Hetfield is anything but introspective. He begins the show by screaming “Mexico!” and then uses his limited Spanish at every opportunity (the crowd responds by singing the songs word-for-word in English). There’s a way-too-early bass solo (second song) by Robert Trujillo that seems to have been placed there just so Hetfield can joyfully announce “Now welcome my friend Roberto!” At a pre-show press conference, Trujillo takes a tattered piece of paper out of his pocket, unfolds it and reads slowly in Spanish “I am so happy to be here to play for you, in the country where my mother was born.” The spirit of that message is pushed relentlessly from the stage by all four band members throughout the night. The crowd, the band, and the stadium itself seem to be humming from some internal amplifier. Back and forth the energy goes. Like the repetition in lovemaking, it never grows old. Finally, Metallica can’t play any longer but they can’t seem to leave. They’re trapped inside the energy wave they’ve helped to create. They take center stage holding a Mexican flag, mugging for the cameras. The stadium gets louder. Then each band member says goodbye in Spanish.  The noise drops a decibel or two and they take that as the cue to make their escape. The show itself is transcendent — the band delivers a twenty-five year panorama of well-written songs with supreme skill. They are roaring but under control, precise but never rote. Yet the DVD, directed by Wayne Isham, is more than a concert documentary. Orgullo, Pasion, Y Gloria  conveys the oppressiveness of the Mexican state apparatus as a force that pushes the fans toward Metallica for release. And those fans are allowed to display their “Pride, Passion, and Glory.” They talk about where they come from and why they love Metallica. They perform Metallica songs. They show their love for each other. Nothing is translated and there are no sub-titles. Hetfield beams as he observes the long line of stalls selling bootleg Metallica gear. “Isn’t this great?” he says without a hint of sarcasm. The effect is to make you feel that instead of watching a Metallica show that just happens to be taking place in Mexico you are actually visiting Mexico and have somehow stumbled across a Metallica show. Excerpted from a 2011 article in Rock & Rap Confidential…. (Courtesy, CounterPunch.org) ON LINE COMMENT OF THE DAY The United States of America is a weak, decrepit, corrupt, impoverished, larcenized shell of its former self. Anyone with functioning eyes can see it. So, if patriotism is the motive for volunteering for a hard and dangerous life, and if patriotism is what the military indoctrinates in its officers, then it’s easy to imagine some of the hats, patriotic to the core, seeing themselves as America’s saviors. You know, clean, good-hearted, disciplined officers assuming the levers of power, mucking out the Augean stables in Washington and Wall Street, formulating plans, giving orders, doing what’s right, restoring order and sanity after the decades-long Katrina of lousy behavior. And then, at a suitable time, with the clocks re-set and the trains running on time, and everyone eating their vegetables and going to bed at a decent hour, returning power to civilians. Can you see it? I can. It’s easy to map out a road to a military-run government. Not as easy to see the road back. A DAY IN THE OAKS As fall approaches we see our local oaks laden with acorns of all shapes and sizes from the pointed valley oak to the squat black oak acorn. This is the best time of year to try your hand at identifying these wonderful native trees. Join Kerry Heise, local botanist on a guided hike at the Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) on Sunday, September 27th from 10am-1pm for ""A Day in the Oaks"". Kerry will guide participants through the process of oak identification and introduce a variety of the diverse oak species present on the site. ""We will likely see up to 7 different tree oaks as we walk from the center including coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), canyon live oak (Q. chrysolepis), blue oak (Q. douglasii), Garry oak (Q. garryana), black oak (Q. kelloggii), valley oak (Q. lobata), and Shreve oak (Q. parvula var. shrevei), and maybe some hybrids too"" commented Kerry, a well-respected local botanist and member of the California Native Plant Society. Hannah Bird, Community Educator at HREC adds ""This is a great place to discover these magnificent trees, our location straddles climate zones, maritime influence and soil and elevation differences. As a result, HREC has around 10 species of oaks across the 5,300 acre site."" Participants are encouraged to wear clothing suitable for hiking whatever the weather and to bring a water bottle. Hikes will take place on roads or trails - but terrain may be steep and uneven at times. No dogs are allowed on the hike due to the presence of guard animals on the site used for sheep protection. Those who would like to share a potluck lunch after the hike are encouraged to bring along plates, utensils, cups and an item of food to share. This is a free event in partnership with the California Native Plant Society. Participants are requested to sign up in advance at: http://ow.ly/SchTq. Hikers will meet at the Rod Shippey Hall, 4070 University Road, Hopland CA 95449 at 10am on Sunday, September 27th.

NEW FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN JOINS UKIAH VALLEY RURAL HEALTH CENTER There may be a shortage of primary care physicians nationwide, but there isn't a shortage in Mendocino and surrounding counties. It looks like the stars are aligned for the Ukiah Valley, with the addition of Kimberley Hanneken, MD, family medicine physician at Ukiah Valley Rural Health Center. As a family physician, Dr. Hanneken specializes in providing care for men, women and children. Dr. Hanneken diagnoses and treats many conditions and offers a wide range of services, including preventive medicine, such as vaccinations, annual physical exams; management of ongoing chronic illnesses and treatment of acute or serious medical conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. ""I always knew I wanted to be a family medicine physician. I love being able to take care of patients of all ages and build relationships with families over time,"" says Dr. Hanneken. ""As a mom, I understand how important it is to have a great relationship with your doctor and to find a physician that you can trust to care for your whole family,"" she adds. Dr. Hanneken earned her medical degree from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago, IL. She then completed her residency in family medicine at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in Decatur, IL. ""I feel that having a child has made me a better doctor. I am able to relate to my patients in a whole new way,"" she shares. Dr. Hanneken is passionate about women's health and caring for children and is also a supporter of breastfeeding.

c3586534-5c59-4ef5-8871-c4417dcb4497,EDITORIAL: World Contraception Day,News,Taipei Times Online,"Today is World Contraception Day, a day not usually marked by the government, which is more concerned about raising the nation’s birth rate.

However, while Taiwan’s birth rate has for years been one of the lowest in the world — an estimated 1.11 children per woman last year — attention needs to be paid to contraception as a public health issue and a social one.

The Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology on Wednesday did its part by releasing the results of its latest survey on sexual activity and contraceptive use by university freshmen. The results were not inspiring.

While only 16 percent of respondents said they had had sexual intercourse, only 10 percent said they used contraception because the intercourse “happened too suddenly.”

Taiwan is considered to have one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Asia, the abortion rate for unmarried teens in Taiwan remains at about 4.8 percent (according to Ministry of the Interior statistics) and doctors have been prescribing tens of thousands of the RU-486 “abortion” pills annually since it became legal to do so in January 2001 – all of which suggests that current methods of promoting contraceptive use are not working as well as they should.

More must be done to address contraception as part of basic sex education. The doctors discussing the association’s findings said that four common mistakes among young people’s efforts at contraception were miscalculating the “safe” period for sexual activity, misusing condoms, misconceptions about contraceptive pills and misuse of emergency measures.

That Taiwan still has a long way to go in its sex education efforts was highlighted last month by Taiwan Women’s Link, which said the materials for high-school health education contained misleading information, were influenced by religious dogma and were rife with gender stereotypes, stigmatization of homosexuality and prejudice against premarital sex.

Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is concerned with the increase in gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. A survey conducted last year on Taiwanese men aged between 15 and 49 found that 46.3 percent of those with multiple partners did not use protection in their most recent sexual encounters, compared with 44.2 percent of respondents overall.

A separate CDC survey in December last year found that of the 70 percent of the men who said that they visited an “adult entertainment establishment” and paid for sex, 30 percent said they did not use protection. It is clear that it is not just teenagers who need more information about contraceptive use.

However, one of the biggest barriers to improved contraceptive use in Taiwan remains the government, since under the National Health Insurance program birth control pills and contraceptive devices are considered “elective items,” along with morning-after pills, which women must pay for separately. Also, teenaged girls seeking a prescription for birth control must have a parent accompany them.

Still, the medical profession is trying to address some of the issues. The Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology has a Web site that provides counseling for teens about contraception and sex education, as well as a free 24-hour hotline that provides professional counseling.

Contraception is not just about preventing births and it is not just a female issue. It is about preventing the spread of STDs, and avoiding the health and social/financial consequences of an unwanted pregnancy. Providing accurate sex education, including contraceptive use, allows young people – and older ones too – to make informed choices.

The Echo can reveal Chief Fire Officer David Johnson – who was finally suspended from his post in April – was paid a total of £224,954 in the 12 months to March 2015. 
 
Months after Mr Johnson was been formally suspended, he is still getting paid. 
 
Almost all the extra money was paid in car and m i l e ag e allowances, even though he wasn’t working. 
 
The revelation came in the week an independent report labelling the service’ culture “corrosive and toxic”. 
 
Union leaders have criticised the news as “a sad indictment” of the way the service was run. 
 
Alan Chinn-Shaw, Essex Fire Brigades Union branch secretary, said: “If the service had acted quicker and done an investigation in January, it could have saved taxpayers a large amount of money.” 
 
The fire service has refused to say why Mr Johnson was off sick , why he was suspended, or why he was allowed to remain so long on sick leave. 
 
The Echo has been told informally Mr Johnson tried to return to work in January 2015, only to be ordered home again on “gardening leave” until his suspension. 
   Promoted stories   
It meant the service is still paying two chief executives. His deputy, Adam Eckley, has been “acting up” since June 2014, on a package which amounted to £194,929 for the year which ended in March. 
 
Ministers have told the fire service it must save £15million – a fifth of its budget –by 2020 and has imposed a recruitment freeze on frontline firefighters. 
 
Mr Johnson, who headed the service from 2005, is thought to have tried to return to work a second time in April, at which point he was suspended. 
 
Mr Chinn-Shaw added: “Since he has been off, industrial relations have got worse and are now at an all-time-low. 
 
“Whether that would have happened anyway, or it was down to the new management, it is difficult to say.”

11e79562-d52e-4329-95f6-485589257876,Vic tram staff to strike again on pay deal (AAP),News,Yahoo! News Australia,"Yarra Trams are holding more talks with the union aimed at averting a planned strike in Melbourne.  
Melbourne's tram workers are going on strike again on Thursday with neither the public transport union nor Yarra Trams willing to compromise over a pay dispute that has dragged on for months. 

The Rail, Tram and Bus Union is holding a four-hour stoppage between 10am and 2pm. 

Yarra Trams held unsuccessful eleventh-hour talks with the union on Wednesday aimed at averting the industrial action but no progress on the pay impasse has been made. 

""We believe tomorrow's industrial action is unnecessary and we believe there is no need to disrupt the city,"" chief executive Clement Michel told reporters. 

""We believe that the offer on the table is a very good offer."" 

The RTBU says Yarra Trams' offer does not recognise the role staff have played in increasing the operator's profits. 

""Yarra Trams should be under no illusion that they can continue to boost their profits without recognising the contribution our members are making to their bottom line,"" RTBU spokesman Phil Altieri said. 

The union has also accused Public Transport Minister Jacinta Allan of picking winners in the battle for a new pay deal. 

RTBU secretary Luba Grigorovitch has written to Labor MPs saying Ms Allan misrepresented the union in her comments to the public about its negotiations with Metro Trains and Yarra Trams. 

""It does not assist in bringing these matters to a speedy resolution if the minister continues to publicly and privately pick winners and losers in this dispute,"" Ms Grigorovitch said in her letter, seen by AAP. 

The state government thinks the union had been too hasty in taking industrial action, and Premier Daniel Andrews has not ruled out going to the Fair Work Commission to prevent any further industrial action from disrupting the city's trams and trains. 

Metro Trains tried unsuccessfully to get the industrial umpire to call off last Friday's train strike because it would endanger the public. 

Thursday's tram stoppage is the second wave of industrial action against Yarra. 

The strike coincides with a rally by taxi drivers to protest against ride share company Uber. 

The rally on the steps of parliament at 10am is an opportunity for the taxi family to ""flex some muscle,"" the Victorian Taxi and Hire Car Families say.

158adcc9-4659-4e9b-a436-b10e02c45aee,China to build US$2bn dam in Guinea,News,Zimbabwe Daily,"GUINEA is in talks with China International Water & Electric Corp to build a US$2 billion hydro-power dam that would almost double the West African country’s energy output, providing new capacity for the expansion of bauxite processing, said Lansana Fofana, an energy ministry official. 
 
The 550MW Souapiti Dam would be CWE’s second project in the country, after it completed the 240MW Kaleta Dam about 120km north of the capital, Conakry, in July. 
 
The Kaleta project tripled Guinea’s electricity production and boosted efforts to expand grid access to more of the country’s 12 million citizens. 
“The idea is to feed the mining industry,” Fofana, the head of the two hydro-power projects, said in an interview this month during an inspection of the 1 545m long Kaleta Dam. 
 
“We want to build refineries for our bauxite. We will even be able to position ourselves as an energy exporter.” 
Fofana’s deputy, Jiahua Liu, who is also CWE’s senior-most official at Kaleta, said in the interview that the Chinese company is interested in the Souapiti project. 
 
It’s up to the government to decide who builds it, he said. 
Guinea has the world’s biggest reserves of bauxite, which is refined into alumina and then smelted into aluminium, and its mines are the backbone of the US$6,6 billion economy. 
 
Souapiti will be built on the Konkoure River, about 2km upstream from Kaleta, with a reservoir big enough for both plants to function even when the river loses most of its flow during the six-month dry season. 
 
China Interest 
Export-Import Bank of China has shown interest in financing Souapiti, according to Fofana. 
It loaned three-quarters of the US$526 million needed to build Kaleta, with Guinea’s government paying the rest. 
The project took three years to complete, during a time when an outbreak of Ebola killed 2 530 people in Guinea and delayed mining and other infrastructure investments. 
 
“We’re in talks with Exim Bank and CWE,” Fofana said. We’re looking for other investors. We’re open to the world.” 
The government will probably pursue plans for a plant able to generate 550 megawatts, out of the three options under consideration, Fofana said. 
 
The biggest-capacity proposal would result in a flood plain requiring more than 15 000 people to be resettled, he said. 
Even so, with World Bank data showing that only a quarter of Guineans have access to the national grid, Fofana said it will take as long as 20 years until the entire country is connected. 
 
Energy Self-Reliance 
“In the next five years, the goal is to buy the energy independence of the country,” Gabriel Curtis, the head of Guinea’s Private Investment Promotion Agency, said in an interview in Conakry. “Right after the elections, that’s going to be one of the first priorities.” 
President Alpha Conde, who is standing for a second term in October 11 elections, has made Kaleta a milestone of his presidency and has built an official residence next to it. 
 
He also promoted Fofana’s predecessor, Cheikh Taliby Sylla, to energy minister in October. 
“The Kaleta Dam has undoubtedly boosted President Alpha Conde’s bid for re-election and raised confidence among foreign investors that the government can put the infrastructure in place for the large-scale exploitation of Guinea’s mineral resources,” Bloomberg Intelligence economist Mark Bohlund said in an interview from London. 
 
The upbeat sentiment comes as miners look for ways to reduce costs amid a slump in commodity prices. 
The country’s mineral wealth also includes high-grade iron-ore deposits, such as Rio Tinto Private Limited Company’s untapped Simandou deposit. 
 
“With iron-ore prices sharply lower compared to a few years ago, the importance of cost efficiency has risen substantially,” said Bohlund. — Bloomberg

Kyrgios produced a typically explosive display under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium but Murray's touch and precision were a class above as the Briton won 7-5 6-3 4-6 6-1. 
  Andy Murray fought off Nick Kyrgios at the US Open   
Murray has now won all four of his meetings against Kyrgios, including three at grand slams this year, and the Scot will now face France's Adrian Mannarino in round two. 

			 
All the pre-match talk had been of Kyrgios' knack for controversy following his spat with Stan Wawrinka and the 20-year-old had newly-appointed mentor Lleyton Hewitt watching on from the players' box. 



 
There were trick shots, racket slams and the usual complaints to the umpire but Murray was clinical amid the chaos and never really looked troubled. 

""He's unpredictable and he can play all the shots,"" Murray said. 

""He served extremely well, he's a fantastic athlete who covers the court extremely well and it's tough to get it out of his strike zone. 

""It was a very tricky match. I just fought hard, mixed it up and managed to get through."" 

			 
Murray started nervously as he framed a ball into the crowd before an attempted drop-shot failed even to reach the net. 

Kyrgios capitalised, breaking his opponent's serve, but the lead was short-lived as the Australian wandered into a missed drop-shot and then crashed a wild forehand long. 

Back on serve, Kyrgios was trying to hit winners from all over the court and while some flew in, more flew out as Murray simply rode out the spectacular and waited for the mistake. 

It made for enthralling viewing and the crowd were left in hysterics when Kyrgios fielded a Murray lob through his legs before slapping away a forehand winner with his very next shot. 

			 
There were the usual grumbles to the umpire, as Kyrgios moaned at one changeover: ""What the hell are they doing letting people in in the middle of the game?"" - but in the points Murray remained in charge. 

Serving to stay in the set at 5-4, Kyrgios saved Murray's first set point with an audacious drop-shot but two games later, the Briton converted with a driving backhand to take a one-set lead. 

As the match drifted in Murray's favour, Kyrgios' concentration decreased and after missing three break points, the youngster threw away his own service game with three sloppy errors. 

Trailing 4-2, Kyrgios spurned four more break points and the chance for a fifth when he opted to hit long a half-volley through his legs, rather than finish into an open court. 

Murray's focus remained fixed throughout and the Briton, outmanoeuvring his opponent with control and precision, coolly served out for a two-set advantage. 

			 
Kygrios finally found a break at the start of the third set but, just as he had in the first set, immediately gave it back as Murray broke to love for 2-1. 

It seemed inevitable Murray would make his experience count again but as Kyrgios knuckled down, the world number three wavered and a double fault helped his opponent clinch the third set. 

With the momentum in his favour, Kyrgios took a toilet break, returned to the court without his sleeves and then received an audible obscenity warning from umpire Carlos Ramos as Murray broke in the very first game. 

It was one-way traffic thereafter as a Kyrgios double fault handed Murray a double break for 5-1 before a looping forehand out confirmed the Scot's victory in two hours and 43 minutes.

fb0274ea-73f8-4a13-bf22-9a13b565be45,Big business wins ways to increase emissions,News,WA Today,"Emission limits for large industrial plants will be set at their highest emissions levels within the five year stretch of 2009-10 to 2013-14. Photo: Glen McCurtayne Big business will be afforded several ways to increase their greenhouse gas emissions without penalty under the second plank of the Abbott government's Direct Action climate change plan.

Environment Minister Greg Hunt released on Wednesday , which will set emissions limits, called ""baselines"", on big industrial plants and power generators.

The government says the baselines will apply to about 330 plants from 140 businesses from mid-next year, and will ensure their emissions do not rise significantly above business as usual levels.

But within the draft rules industry has been given a number of ways to apply for an increase over their initial baseline without penalty.

In response to the draft rules, some analysts warned the way the baselines will be set will allow industrial emissions to continue to rise significantly, even as Australia pledges to cut its overall emissions by 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. 

Carbon market analysts, RepuTex, forecast emissions from companies covered by the proposed safeguards would grow by 20 per cent over the next 15 years.

""The design of the new scheme indicates a significant disconnect between emissions growth and the government's new post-2020 emissions target,"" RepuTex's Hugh Grossman said.

Mr Grossman added that none of Australia's top 20 emitting facilities, including the big brown coal power plants in Victoria, would face any liability under the proposed rules.

""Structurally, very few companies will be at risk of exceeding their historical high point baseline. We envisage less than 30 companies will be at risk,"" Mr Grossman said.

The baseline for a large industrial plant will be set at its highest emissions levels within the five year stretch of 2009-10 to 2013-14.

The rules then allow for a facility to apply for an increase if it is new and has insufficient historical emissions data, expands its capacity by 20 per cent or more, or is restructuring due to industry consolidation or following a financial crisis.

Miners and the gas industry can also apply for an increase twice up to 2025 if they move to tap natural resource reserves with higher CO2 content.

And if a plant exceeds its overall baseline, but the intensity ratio of emissions to what it produced falls, it will get temporary increase for the year.

If a facility goes over their baseline the government will allow it to make good via measures such as purchasing carbon credits or decreasing emissions in following years.

In the worst cases companies could face fines of up to $1.8 million. But the government has said it is not banking on collecting any money from the safeguard scheme.

From 2020 the government will demand that any new plants built in Australia will have to meet that industry's ""best practice"" for emissions. This provision, the government argues, will put downward pressure on industrial emissions.

The safeguards joins the already in place emissions reduction fund, which pays farmers and business to cut emissions through an auction system, as part of the Direct Action plan.

Direct Action is the Abbott government's replacement to the national carbon price, which it repealed last year. 

The carbon price forced large companies to pay a cost for each tonne of greenhouse gas it released. That price was first set by the government, and was later to be left to the market.

The ability of Direct Action to make a significant contribution to Australia's emissions reduction targets has been dismissed by many observers. found Australia was well behind other developed countries in having policies in place that could meet its 2030 goals. And it said the Abbott government's repeal of the carbon price and cuts to the renewable energy target had made the 2030 goal significantly harder to achieve.",642,"Emission limits for large industrial plants will be set at their highest emissions levels within the five year stretch of 2009-10 to 2013-14.

d8e4b2b6-5ace-4dc0-b534-9c1698b41f87,Mourinho faces big decision for Chelsea against Arsenal,News,Kentucky.com,"LONDON — After a 4-0 victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv reminded Jose Mourinho of what it feels like to win, the Chelsea manager has an important decision to make before facing Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday.

Mourinho made six changes for the Group G Champions League game on Wednesday after Chelsea lost their third league game out of five at Everton last Saturday. Regular starters John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa were on the bench.

The commanding victory could boost confidence among the Chelsea ranks but Mourinho must decide whether to return his underperforming stars to the lineup, or keep faith with players such as Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Loic Remy, who impressed against Maccabi.

With Willian and Pedro Rodriguez expected to miss the Arsenal game through injury, Eden Hazard should keep his starting place, despite an unconfident performance against Maccabi where he missed a penalty after five minutes.

Here are some things to know ahead of this weekend's Premier League fixtures:

VAN GAAL TAKES ON KOEMAN

Manchester United travel to Southampton on Sunday, where Louis van Gaal will renew his rivalry with Dutch counterpart Ronald Koeman.

Their fractious relationship stems from when Koeman was manager at Ajax and Van Gaal was appointed technical director.

Last season, Van Gaal's United battled to a scarcely deserved 2-1 victory at St. Mary's, before Koeman avenged the defeat with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.

United heads to the south of England in inconsistent form — an impressive 3-1 victory against fierce rival Liverpool at Old Trafford was followed by a 2-1 loss to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Captain Wayne Rooney missed both games with a hamstring problem and it's unclear whether he will be available against Southampton.

CITY WARY OF WEST HAM

Manchester City has five wins from its opening five games in the Premier League and is yet to concede a goal.

Manuel Pellegrini's team is the early pacesetter atop the standings and the overwhelming favorite to beat West Ham on Saturday - although it knows the east London club is capable of upsets.

Manager Slaven Bilic has already masterminded West Ham to two surprise away victories against Arsenal and Liverpool - games it was widely expected to lose. It comfortably beat Newcastle 2-0 on Monday and will head to Manchester confident of springing another surprise.

West Ham could face a City side missing Sergio Aguero. The striker went off after 25 minutes with a right knee problem when his side beat Crystal Palace last weekend and missed Tuesday's loss to Juventus in the Champions League.

---

LIVERPOOL MUST BEAT NORWICH

After two wins and a draw at Arsenal gave Liverpool a solid start to the Premier League season, Brendan Rodgers' side hit reverse.

It has since lost 3-0 to West Ham at Anfield and 3-1 at fierce rival United. Rodgers has swiftly found himself back under the scrutiny he ended last season under.

He needs to arrest Liverpool's slide urgently and left Martin Skrtel, Dejan Lovren, Nathaniel Clyne, Lucas Leiva, James Milner and striker Christian Benteke out of the squad to play Bordeaux in the Europa League so they are fresh to face Norwich on Sunday.

Rodgers wants Liverpool to return to the attacking style he is associated with.

""I think it is good I have an identity as a coach,"" Rodgers said. ""I am confident we can get back to playing that way and it is something I along with the staff are working very hard to reinforce.""

SWANSEA BATTLE RESURGENT EVERTON

Swansea and Everton have made impressive starts to the season with commanding wins against difficult teams.

Welsh side Swansea beat United 2-1 in August, and also held Chelsea to a 2-2 draw on the opening day of the season, while Everton beat Chelsea last weekend and also recorded a commanding 3-0 victory over Southampton in August.

The two sides meet at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday and victory for either would enforce a promising start to the season.

698f7e6a-bc2a-4daa-9e96-dcecf91a9676,Johanna Konta keeps stunning US Open run going with win over Andrea Petkovic,News,Morley Observer & Advertiser,"Britain's US Open underdog Johanna Konta clinched another shock win at the US Open as she knocked out 18th seed Andrea Petkovic to reach the last 16. 
 
		 
Ranked 97th in the world, Konta sits 79 spots lower than her German opponent but the British number two continued her remarkable run in Flushing Meadows with a 7-6 (7/2) 6-3 victory. 
  Johanna Konta has again upset the odds to reach the last 16 at the US Open   
It means Konta extends an impressive winning streak to 16 consecutive matches and she will now meet two-time major champion Petra Kvitova for a place in the quarter-finals. 

			 
Beating the Czech represents a seismic task but if achieved, Konta would become the first British female to reach the last eight of a major tournament since Jo Durie at Wimbledon in 1984. 



 
""It was tough, even if she wasn't at her best she is still one of the best competitors on the tour,"" Konta said of her match against Petkovic. 

""I'm just really happy I made it through in the end.  I've been playing a good level of tennis all year but it's always a confidence boost when you get to compete against the best players in the world."" 

Arriving in New York with only one grand slam victory in her career, Konta now has three in a week including the second round scalp of ninth seed Garbine Muguruza, who made the Wimbledon final in June. 

Wimbledon was the scene of Konta's last defeat, coming against Maria Sharapova in the first round, and the 24-year-old is likely to climb into the world's top 60 regardless of the outcome against Kvitova. 

			 
British number one Heather Watson, due to rise slightly from number 61, is certainly within her sights while the prize for making the US Open fourth round stands at 213,575 US dollars (£140,848) - the largest haul of Konta's career. 

The Briton looked nervous early on, falling 2-0 down after two unfortunate net chords, but she soon found her rhythm to move 4-3 ahead. 

Petkovic was rattled by her opponent's forceful hitting and resolute defence, with the German showing her frustration as she picked up a code violation for whacking her racquet into the court. 

Both players struggled to hold serve but Konta found her groove in the tie-break, winning seven points in a row to take a deserved one-set lead. 

			 
A beleaguered Petkovic struggled to respond and after the first game of the second she informed the umpire she felt unwell and wanted treatment. 

By the time the medic arrived she was 3-0 down as Konta showed no mercy, driving her backhand into the corners to excellent effect. 

She spurned three match points when serving at 5-1, and then two more at 5-3, to revive memories of former matches when she made a habit of wobbling away from winning positions. 

Konta, however, is a player transformed and she finally converted her sixth to confirm victory in one hour and 56 minutes.

                    Click here to view the full text on ScienceDirect. 
 Background and aims 
Dilated gastrojejunal anastomosis aperture is associated with weight regain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Transoral outlet reduction (TORe) has proven safe and effective for treatment of weight regain. The objective of this study was to determine long-term weight trend and number needed to treat for TORe. 
Methods 
This prospective series included consecutive post-RYGB patients with weight regain and gastrojejunal anastomosis aperture >15 mm. TORe was performed with a full-thickness endoscopic suturing device. 
Results 
150 patients who had regained 49.9 ± 3.6% of the weight lost after gastric bypass (4.1 ± 0.3 kg/y after nadir) before TORe. At TORe, BMI was 40.2 ± 0.8 kg/m2 and weight was 110.7 ± 2.2 kg. At 1 year, weight loss was 10.5 ± 1.2 kg or 24.9 ± 2.6% EWL; at 2 years, weight loss was 9.0 ± 1.7 kg or 20.0 ± 6.4% EWL; at 3 years, weight loss was 9.5 ± 2.1 kg or 19.2 ± 4.6% EWL. Number needed to treat for arrest of weight regain was 1.0 at 6 months, 1.1 at 1 year, and 1.2 at 2 and 3 years. NNT to maintain ≥5 kg weight loss from TORe was 1.2 at 6 months, 1.5 at 1 year, 1.9 at 2 years, and 2.0 at 3 years. 
Conclusions 
TORe safely and effectively arrested weight regain, and provided durable weight loss with a low number needed to treat. Patients with weight regain after RYGB should be evaluated for dilation of the gastrojejunal anastomosis, as TORe can be part of a multidisciplinary strategy to address post-RYGB weight regain.

e1ba690b-c851-47b5-ae1c-a54617565f10,Grant will allow Wyoming to text smart vehicle tech,News,Casper Star Tribune,"CHEYENNE -- A federal grant will let Wyoming test next-generation “smart vehicles” that could make highway driving less dangerous. 

The U.S. Department of Transportation announced this week that Wyoming is one of three locations selected for the Connected Vehicle Pilot Deployment Program. 

Wyoming, New York City and Tampa, Florida, will share up to $42 million to use “innovative applications” for vehicles that share and communicate anonymous information with each other and their surroundings. 

The exact amount the Cowboy State will get is unknown. But Vince Garcia, a program manager with the Wyoming Department of Transportation, said the agency estimated in its application it would need “in the ballpark” of $5 million. 

Wyoming’s funds will be targeted at improving freight traffic flows through the Interstate 80 corridor. 

Ali Ragan, another project manager with WYDOT, said it is too early to say what technology will be used and how many vehicles will be in the program. 

But she said some possibilities include letting truckers know through their phones, in-vehicle GPS units or other methods whether there are high-wind warnings, construction or other dangers ahead. 

“Anyone who drives on I-80 knows that there is a lot of truck traffic and that traffic can really impact safety,” she said. “We want to have information to create safer traveling conditions and to improve safety for everyone.” 

Vehicle-to-vehicle communications also could be used to “harmonize” the speed among drivers by sending speed recommendations based on road conditions and level of congestion ahead. 

Ragan added that passenger vehicles could be incorporated in the program. 

Participation in the program would be voluntary. But Ragan said the Wyoming Trucking Association is supporting the project and several trucking firms have expressed interest. 

Garcia said data-collection units on the vehicles also could send information back to WYDOT workers or first responders to let them know instantly about dangerous road conditions or vehicle crashes. 

“We could even use vehicle sensors by letting us know when windshield wipers or things like anti-lock brakes are triggered,” he said. 

Ragan said the state’s program will take about a year to get off the ground. The development and demonstration phases will then occur over the following three years. 

WYDOT officials expect to learn more about specific provisions in the grant in the coming weeks. 

While Wyoming’s grant will focus on the rural parts of the country, the two other locations will see how so-called “smart vehicles” work in more populated areas. 
 
In announcing the awards, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx called the grants, “a big step forward” for the country’s transportation future. 

“It has been a core mission of the department to support promising new technologies, he said in a statement. “Through these types of smart investments, we are opening the door to a safer and cleaner network and expanding how future generations travel.” 

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, research has shown that this type of technology can reduce unimpaired vehicle crashes by 80 percent and reduce the billions of hours that Americans spend in traffic each year. 

The National Highway Transportation Safety Association is expected to issue a proposed rule by the end of the year to eventually require all new vehicles to come equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication equipment. 

Fox said the success of these pilot programs can prove that vehicle-to-vehicle communication is effective and cost effective on a large scale. 

“We saw them work at the first test site we launched back in 2010 on the streets of Ann Arbor, Michigan,” he said. “Now we’ll see them work again in New York, Wyoming and Tampa – and in more communities where we’ll launch pilots in the near future. 

“With good feedback from pilots like the ones we've launched (this week), we can anticipate these technologies becoming part of everyday reality across America in the very near future.”",637,"CHEYENNE -- A federal grant will let Wyoming test next-generation “smart vehicles” that could make highway driving less dangerous.

They weren’t doctors or therapists, and their employer, a wide-ranging youth outreach organization called The Door, isn’t only a counseling center. But mental health how-tos are part of everyone’s training, whether they’re career advisers or basketball coaches, and reaching out to offer help is part of everyone’s job. 
 
New York City is about to put that idea to a major test: a $30 million plan to provide mental health training to staffers at social service organizations. They’ll be prepared to screen people for possible psychological problems, provide information and try to motivate them to make changes in their lives.

“Everyone can be a healer,” city first lady and mental health advocate-in-chief Chirlane McCray said in a statement. 
 
It’s an increasingly popular approach to extending the thinly stretched mental health system, fostering awareness and reaching people who don’t seek out professionals. But there also has been some debate over what role nonprofessionals should play. 
 
The concept dates to the 1960s but has taken new hold recently in places from Philadelphia, which trained 10,000 workers and residents in “mental health first aid” and is aiming for 150,000, to Goa, India, where a 2,700-patient experiment found some benefits to including lay counselors in psychological care. 
 
The World Health Organization has called nonprofessionals “a valuable resource for mental health care.” The White House led a push that is directing $15 million a year to train teachers in mental health first aid, which 450,000 people nationwide have taken since 2008. About 1,000 people have gone through a separate program called “emotional CPR.” 
 
Part of the rationale is sheer numbers: More than 43 million American adults had some diagnosable mental illness in 2013, according to a federal estimate. Meanwhile, over 97 million Americans live in areas, some in New York City, that the government says have too few mental health professionals. 
 
“If we’re really going to take on mental illness, as widespread and impactful as it is, we’re not going to reach that scope of impact with one provider at a time,” says Dr. Gary Belkin, who heads the city Health Department’s mental health division. 
 
Mental health advocates stress that training the public shouldn’t substitute for having enough professionals, and solace and support aren’t the same as treatment. Still, proponents say lay people can be what licensed specialists sometimes can’t: eyes and ears outside a therapist’s office, familiar figures who can start conversations about what’s wrong. 
 
Shatiera Freeman doesn’t hesitate to broach those conversations at The Door, where she teaches about health. She’s not a mental health expert, and sometimes, she’ll suggest a youth talk to one. But first she’s ready to lend her own ear, remembering the various staffers she turned to as a teenager using The Door’s services herself. 
 
“It’s not ‘let’s just send them to therapy.’ It’s ‘let’s sit down and figure out what’s going on,'” says Freeman, 23. “Our job is to care.” 
 
That’s why every worker learns about trauma, adolescent development and how to help, deputy executive director David Vincent said. (The Door’s offerings, which range from recording studios to a drop-in-center for runaways, got international attention when Britain’s Prince William and his wife, Kate, visited last year.) 
 
As New York City takes a page from places like The Door, mental health advocates are cheering — loudly— but sounding notes of caution. 
 
“It could, depending on how it’s done, have a normalizing function … (or) disparage people or make people feel like they’re in a worse condition than they are,” says Harvey Rosenthal, the executive director of the New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitative Services. 
 
Advocates worry about non-professionals slipping from noticing possible problems to diagnosing them, or overblowing unusual behavior into mental illness. Some researchers see having lay people do screenings as a recipe for false positives and unneeded follow-up; others, however, say it can accurately assess a community’s psychological needs and link people to professional help. 
 
Officials say New York’s project will study how well the nonprofessionals do at connecting people to mental health services and how they fare. 
 
Back at The Door, Freeman has her own perspective on what nonprofessionals need to be effective. 
 
Training is useful, she said, but so is “the instinct that we already have … we’re here to help.”

Servindi, 21 September, 2015.- A press conference on Wednesday morning, September 16, served as public launch of the Alternative Platform to the Annual Meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund to be held in Lima next month. The initiative is a coalition of social, youth and grassroots organizations that promotes critical discussion spaces as part of the Annual Meetings. The presentation was made by Martha Torres Marcos-Ibañez, Amazon Specialist at Rights, Environment and Natural Resources (DAR); Jorge Bedoya, lawyer, journalist and adviser of the Latin American Network on Debt and Development (Latindadd); José de Echave, economist at Cooperaccion and former deputy Minister of the Environment; Jorge Rodriguez Rios, anthropologist and representative of the Alternative Platform Youth Committee; and Giancarlo Contreras, president of the Peruvian Federation of Rare Diseases (FEPER). The spokespersons announced this alternative event in the tradition of the People’s Summit to be held the 7th, 8th and 9th of October. The program will be structured along four pilars: World Bank and social-environmental safeguards, climate change, respect for human rights and indigenous peoples. The Alternative Event will close with a massive People’s March on the 9th October. The concentration will convene at 9:00 am at the Plaza San Martin in the centre of Lima, where a cultural activity will be carried out to start the march at 11:00 am. One of the objectives of the march will be to deliver a document to the World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings, summarizing the results of the open and democratic social participation and the critique and proposals made for a fairer socio-economic society.

Cinemas are expected to beef up their security in a crackdown on scammers sneakily filming the new 007 blockbuster when it hits the big screen next month. 
 
Movie pirates are resorting to increasingly clandestine tactics to avoid being caught, hiding their recording devices in holes cut into popcorn cartons. 
 
But Kieron Sharp, director general of the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), which tackles piracy, said staff kitted out in night-vision goggles are patrolling cinemas to catch anyone trying to make illegal recordings. 
 
He said: ""The bigger the film and the more anticipated it is, the higher risk it is. We have staff on extra alert for that. 
 
""James Bond is a big risk and we will be working with cinema operators and the distributors making sure we will keep that as tight as possible. We really don't want to see that recorded. 
 
""They are on alert, particularly with the bigger films like James Bond, to really drill down to who is in the auditorium and who might possibly be recording. 
 
""They still do the sweeps around the auditoriums with the night vision glasses regardless of the film. But sometimes extra security is put in place for things like Bond."" 
   Promoted stories   
Directed by Sam Mendes, Spectre is expected to be one of the biggest box office hits of the year. 
 
Mr Sharp's warning came after a man, 33, was arrested in Nottinghamshire for allegedly filming American Ultra and Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials at the cinema. 
 
He said most movie pirates are young men who compete with each other for the dubious honour of being the first to record and upload the film online. 
 
So action movies such as the Fast And Furious franchise or James Bond are particular targets. 
 
Mr Sharp said: ""You also have to look at certain films in terms of their interest to certain demographics of the population as well. 
 
""So films like the Fast And Furious series is always very, very risky - high risk to us in terms of protecting that film in the cinema."" 
 
Last year Philip Danks was jailed for 33 months for filming Fast And Furious 6 in a cinema and selling copies on Facebook. 
 
He boasted on Facebook ""Seven billion people on the planet and I was the first."" 
 
The rise of smartphones means it is easier than ever to record films. But while criminals try to use the cloak of darkness in auditoriums and clever tactics to break the law, staff use night-vision goggles to expose movie pirates. 
 
Mr Sharp said: ""The days of trying to conceal a camcorder are over. It is much easier to conceal a smartphone. They use various tricks like cutting a hole in a popcorn cup and putting it wedged in a popcorn cup. 
 
""Sometimes we see a sock with a hole cut in it which they put over the phone so there is no shine to the phone."" 
 
Anti-piracy teams have managed to dramatically slash the number of illegal recordings made in British cinemas since they began training cinema staff who, armed in military-style goggles, scan theatres for recorders. 
 
But illegal cinema recordings can mean big business and must be stamped out altogether, Mr Sharp warned.

He said: ""The film industry is huge to the British economy and the amount of people it employs.

9dbb7486-e5c5-4a24-ae99-62edd8fdd214,Roots of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s May Be in How You Sleep,Blog,Brain Blogger,"Literature is full of odes sung in praise of sleep; poets have likened it to a gift from the heavens. Read up any healthy lifestyle checklist; getting your nightly quota of beauty sleep always features somewhere in the list. 
 
Sleeping pills are one of the most commonly purchased over-the-counter medicines. Nobody doubts the benefit of sleep and scientists have proven that sleep is restorative. The body heals itself when we sleep. Some research studies have also identified another fundamental purpose of sleep — to eliminate harmful neurotoxins from the brain that would otherwise go on to trigger Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and a host of other debilitating neurodegenerative conditions. 
 
However, a recent study has added one more intriguing detail to the above findings. According to this study, sleeping on your side eliminates waste products from the brain more effectively. The clues are in the glymphatic pathways of our brains. 
 
The role of the glymphatic pathway 
 
Neural cells are extremely sensitive to their environments. Therefore, toxins produced in the brain have to be eliminated quickly to prevent cell damage. 
 
The brain is not served by the conventional lymphatic system that filters out toxic waste products from the other parts of the body. Instead, the brain has a mechanism whereby cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) enters the brain, circulates around it, and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF). This process filters out the waste products from the brain while providing nutrients to the neural cells, regulated by the glymphatic pathways. And according to scientists, the efficiency of this system depends on how we sleep! 
 
When we are awake, the normal metabolic workings of the central nervous system produce harmful toxins as by-products that accumulate in the ISF. These include the beta-amyloid peptide and tau proteins. It is believed that an abnormal accumulation of these substances triggers the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. 
 
Lack of sleep is also known to bring on brain impairment and a decline in cognitive functionalities that manifest as slower reaction times, difficulty learning and remembering, and an increased incidence of seizures. Severe cases of insomnia have also been known to cause dementia and even death. 
 
The importance of the glymphatic pathway was also highlighted in a recent study on subjects who had suffered some form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). During this study, it was discovered that the functionality of the glymphatic pathway was reduced by up to 60 percent in subjects with TBI. 
 
Imaging studies also showed that these patients had an abnormal accumulation of tau protein in their brains. Now it is known that TBI is a risk factor for the early onset of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. So, scientists suggest that the impairment of the glymphatic pathway and the resultant neural cell damage can increase the chances of a person developing neurodegenerative disorders, slipping into a coma, or even dying. 
 
The rate at which waste matter clears from the brain is a critical consideration in human beings. Some toxic solutes like peptides produced in the brain have large areas and thus take more time to filter out of the brain than smaller molecules. So the efficiency of the glymphatic system is also determined by the amount of bulk flow it promotes. The greater the flow, the faster the larger molecules will be eliminated from the brain. 
 
The rate of clearance of the waste products from the brain can provide critical insights to determine the appearance and calculate the progression of neural diseases. These can help detect the early warning signs of debilitating diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and allow a person take steps to stall its progress. 
 
The way the glymphatic pathway works when we sleep 
 
Scientists had long been intrigued to know why sleep is conserved across all natural species. They were certain that sleep promotes a vital biological function. They now know. 
 
The concentration of metabolic by-products like amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the ISF is higher when an individual is awake than when he is asleep. It indicates that these substances are produced more during waking hours than during sleep. The studies also discovered that these by-products were cleared faster from the brain when the subject was asleep than when he was awake. 
 
A recent study reveals that the position in which one is sleeping also affects the rate of clearance of brain waste matter. An experiment was carried out on laboratory mice in three sleep positions — when they were lateral, prone, and supine. During the tests, it was discovered that the waste cleared from the brains (that is, the glymphatic pathway functioned more efficiently) of these animals faster when they were in a lateral position. 
 
In this context, it is interesting to note that the lateral position is the most common sleeping position in human beings and many animals. So it seems that Mother Nature knew what she was doing to keep her creations healthy. 
 
The implications of the new findings 
 
Scientists should further investigate this startling find, in order to figure out why the efficacy of the glymphatic system improves in a particular sleeping position. Such knowledge will not only help them find out more about the workings of the waste clearance system of the brain but may also provide valuable insights into why neural diseases develop and how they progress. These findings should also help them research and develop pharmacological methods to improve the functionality of the glymphatic pathways to help those with compromised systems stall neural decay and improve the quality of their lives. 
 
In the meantime, you may try falling off to sleep while lying on your side, in case that is not your usual sleeping position.

Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/gkcqrv/global_liion ) has announced the addition of the ""Global Li-ion Battery Market 2015-2019"" report to their offering. 
   
The global Li-ion battery market to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% during 2014-2019. 

The report, Global Li-ion Battery Market 2015-2019, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. 

The sales of fuel-driven cars are gaining momentum as declining crude oil prices have made these vehicles more economical compared to EVs. Falling oil prices are driving consumers away from eco-friendly EVs, which has had a slight impact on the sales of EVs in the US. 

According to the report, commoditization and easy accessibility of Internet networks has led to widespread usage of electronic devices such as tablets, smartphones, and laptops. As commoditization continues, Internet penetration will reach remote and rural parts of various countries worldwide. 

Further, the report states that many countries still do not have a defined set of regulations and legislations governing the purchase and sale of e-bikes. Thus, manufacturers and retailers are hesitant to enter the markets in these countries due to uncertainty over the change of rules that might make the product ineligible to be sold or used in the market.

MADISON, Tenn. 

""Their new fast-acting Rejuvenate Plus formula has been proven to reduce inflammation in canines, and it does not have the dangerous side effects associated with typical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like Rimadyl®, one of the few effective pain relievers for dogs, but which is toxic to the animal,"" says Mark Faulkner 

In a continuing clinical trial, Rejuvenate Plus' new formula has demonstrated remarkable and measurable success in over 75% of dogs. Owners reported their dogs had greater mobility and more energy and overall improved health after only 10 days of taking the supplement (most within 5 days). Perhaps the best aspect of Rejuvenate Plus is that it includes only safe ingredients, making it a top choice among vets and dog owners embracing a holistic approach to healing. 

The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association defines holistic medicine as a gentle and minimally invasive approach that maximizes health, wellbeing and comfort. Preventive medicine is prioritized, while the treatment philosophy for existing conditions focuses on comfort and looks closely at the costs and benefits of every possible treatment. Holistic medicine can incorporate both modern and traditional treatment methods, as deemed appropriate for each individual patient. The adoption of a holistic approach to human health has long been on the upswing, and it's likely that this discipline will likewise trend upwards in veterinary medicine.

Rejuvenate Plus is not the only supplement from this product line to earn a loyal following among vets. Rejuvenate Plus High Performance was designed specifically to optimize endurance and recovery for working, sporting and hunting dogs. It uses one of Vireo's proprietary compounds as a key ingredient, creatine hydrochloride (HCl). Creatine-HCL is a patented formulation of a naturally occurring organic compound that supports muscle endurance. Athletes and bodybuilders have depended on various creatine supplements for years as a way to recover from intense exercise. 

The purchase agreement with Rejuvenate Plus includes a long-term partnership with the creators of Rejuvenate Plus. As a part of a scientific advisory team, the developers will provide hands-on guidance and expertise in future product research and testing. Consumers and veterinarians can therefore expect Vireo Systems to introduce additional new vet supplements in the years to come.

Hillary Clinton has said she wished she had made a “different choice” and not used a private email account while serving as US secretary of state. 
 
“I’m sorry this has been confusing,” she told the cable news channel MSNBC. 
 
Her use of private email has generated a barrage of criticism as Mrs Clinton runs for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2016 election. 
 
Critics say that her set-up was not secure, contrary to government policy, and meant to shield her from oversight. 
 
Political analysts – including fellow Democrats – have said the Clinton campaign has stumbled in its response to the controversy and Mrs Clinton had not seemed contrite – at times even making jokes about the email issue. 
 
A more sombre Mrs Clinton took full responsibility in Friday’s interview, saying she didn’t “stop and think” about how use of a private email account would be perceived. 
 
It has been a major issue in the presidential race. Polls show an increasing number of voters view her as “untrustworthy” due in part to the questions surrounding her email use. 
 
Under US federal law, officials’ correspondence is considered to be US government property. 
 
Government employees are encouraged to use official email accounts although some top officials have used personal accounts in the past. 
 
In March, Mrs Clinton said she and her lawyers made the decision over what would be considered work-related email when the state department asked for records from former secretaries of state. 
 
The emails deemed work-related were about half of the 60,000 emails she sent in total during her time in office. The emails she deemed personal were deleted, Mrs Clinton said. 
 
Since then, the state department has been releasing the emails to the public in batches about once a month.",293,"Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton has said she wished she had made a “different choice” and not used a private email account while serving as US secretary of state. “I’m sorry this has been confusing,” she told the cable news channel MSNBC.

4dfe851d-1e44-454f-bcc3-584b95497984,Warren Gatland: Sam Burgess to receive same attention as England team-mates,News,Mansfield Chad,"Warren Gatland says Wales will not single out Sam Burgess for special attention in Saturday's crunch World Cup clash against England.

Burgess, despite playing just 112 minutes of international rugby union since his high-profile switch from league a year ago, lines up in England's reshaped midfield alongside centre partner Brad Barritt and fly-half Owen Farrell.

It is considered in many quarters to be a major gamble by England head coach Stuart Lancaster, especially for a game of such magnitude, as both teams face an early major test of their quarter-final ambitions.

Asked about Burgess' inexperience, Wales head coach Gatland said: ""He's got inexperience at rugby (union), but not at big occasions.

""He is a big man at 6ft 5in. You don't single out anyone personally, you just concentrate on yourself. We won't be trying to single out Sam Burgess at all.

""We will be going out there to smash him like everyone else. That's the kind of approach. We're not rubbing our hands together about one player thinking there's a weakness there at all - that is not the way we look at it.

""When you underestimate a player, it comes back to bite you. You can't single out any one individual.""

England's midfield reorganisation has been largely forced due to an injury suffered by outside centre attacking force Jonathan Joseph, and Gatland acknowledged Joseph's threat.

""What has caused us problems with England in the last couple of years has been footwork,"" he added.

""Joseph has caused us a lot of problems at centre - he has been one of the outstanding centres in world rugby in the last 12 months or so - and (Anthony) Watson and (Jonny) May are great finishers as well. They are a threat,"" he added.

""I am not sure that Burgess and Barritt have the same footwork as they do, but they will be more direct as players and bring a physical element that will be required at this level.

""England may play a certain way. For both sides, it's kicking smartly, and I think you will see a a pretty tight game for a period.

""England talk about taking teams to a kill zone, and you have to be able to match that intensity for the whole 80 minutes.

""In the Six Nations (last season), we were comfortable for 40 minutes in that first game, and basically England then blew us away.

""We got dragged into a game that we didn't want to do. They wanted to keep the ball in the scrums and they wanted to drive every lineout. We have got to be aware that that is potentially a tactic they might bring on Saturday, and they have the ability to revert to that.

""We have got to make sure that we've got to be able to impose ourselves on them as well.""

f0bf7997-8f45-4703-963d-5f7486446fb8,Shock: Referee has shocker: Gencler grab a point at home to Besiktas,Blog,The round ball in Ankara,"I'm not about to say we were robbed, Besiktas were clearly the better team... but there was some dodgy stuff happening out there last night.
Genclerbirligi 1 - 1 Besiktas
Just Spine and me down at the Beer Bus before kick-off (a sentence I have a feeling I will using a lot of this season. Thanks Passolig). A lovely warm Monday night right before the bayram had the pubs in Kizilay chocka-block. Beers and kofte and off to the stadium.
In years gone by a Gencler-Besiktas match would mean having to get to the stadium a bit early but in today's Passolig-era the queue at the gates was about five people long. Even then the ushers were saying that the other gate had no-one waiting.
So managed to get in with plenty of time to spare and saw that the famous Middle East journalist (copyright Round ball in Ankara) Patrick Keddie had found his way to the top of Section C.
Crowd-wise I'd say we had a couple of thousand, maybe three... while Besiktas had four to five thousand. The Besiktas turnout was impressive. They filled the entire Saatli away section and sang wholeheartedly for the full match. I'm guessing that the reason there were so many is because last season Besiktas played a lot of their home games just outside of Ankara, in Yenikent, and so all these fans would have already owned Passolig cards.
Post-match beers. Onto the match itself and ... oh shit. Besiktas came out flying and within five minutes I had decided that we were going to lose 5-0. Thing was though, they completely dominated but yet weren't getting any shots on goal. Still it was scary as hell and then Gencler, playing with three up front (Djalma, Stancu and El Kabir) started sending balls through. Counterattacking opportunities were taken and it was us who were getting all the shots on goal. Then in the 23rd minute Irfan Kahveci took a short corner, Ahmet Oguz sent in a cross that was headed for El Kabir's head but instead found our old friend Tosic who expertly sent it into the back of the net. Unfortunately for Tosic  he no longer plays for us and it was counted as an own goal.
The rest of the half was good stuff and had it all ended then I would have been a happy man.
Second half though... bllluuurghhh.
 Aydınus'un kırmızı kart göstermesi için ne olması gerekiyor? http://t.co/pvD07qCyrt pic.twitter.com/fljGd7eGhl — Ankara'da Spor (@ANKARADASPOR) September 21, 2015 Ankara'da Spor asks ""What more does it take for Aydınus to show a red card?""       Gencler seemed to dropped a couple of gears and Besiktas finally got some shots off. Some desperate defending saved us time and again and Hopf pulled off some nice saves. It was pretty much inevitable that Besiktas would score and eventually they did. There was some talk afterwards that their goal was offside. I think we are talking centimetres here and in any case with the sort of football Besiktas were playing... I can't complain.   The second half also saw the referee pretty much lose control of the match. There was some serious rough play out there and the ref just couldn't stop it. All of the 50/50 decisions were going Besiktas' way. There was at least one direct red that wasn't given and we had a bizarre yellow given to Hopf for time wasting. The thing with the last one was that Besiktas were making a replacement at the time. Weird.
There was some handbags after the match between the Besiktas keeper and Skullason (I think)... but nothing will come of it.
Match over and off to Eski Yeni for a beer to celebrate the point.    
EDIT: I forgot to add that it was great to see Ante Kulusic back in defence.

f96db661-7320-4d0c-9bc2-4db17b0609ee,Difference Maker (Part 2 in the Peace Series),Blog,This Crazy Mom,"I want to be difference maker. I know you do too. As we navigate through this maze of life, with a passion for the Gospel of Jesus, we must tread with the strength and courage of a lion, while exhibiting grace and peace, like that of a lamb. We will require strength as we walk head on into places where the name of Jesus is trampled on, and we courageously say, ""That is MY God."" We will certainly need the extra grace, as we encounter the broken who reject Christ, because they do not understand authentic love.

Sadly, we often leave the lamb behind and charge forward with a roar. We feel compelled to speak up, yet when we do so, we often leave no room for peace. Paul tells us in Romans (12:1), ""If possible, on your part, live at peace with everyone."" But, what does that look like for us, who are anxious to make a difference in the conflicted world around us?

Standing strong on the Gospel of Jesus does not mean we approach the debate podium with every opportunity that we are given. The Gospel of Jesus does not bid us to fight a fleshly battle, only to come away, both parties bruised and battered, yet no better for it. The way of Jesus does not lead us to be ""right"" or to bring down the gavel of condemnation.

""But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, without favoritism and hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace."" James 3:17-18

Often, the way of our Savior calls us to wisely walk past our side of the debate, to bring a glass of water to the opposing party. Often, we would be better off shredding our notes and lifting our eyes to see past the offending topic, and into the eyes of the person that Jesus loves. Then, and only then, can we truly be the hands and feet of Jesus.

 When we read about the ministry of Jesus, we see him stoop down to look into the eyes of a prostitute, dine with a despised and corrupt tax-collector, answer the questions of a doubting religious leader, and the list goes on.This was His avenue for bringing light. Instead of telling the world that it is dark, we can be the defining light. We can be the hands and feet of Jesus. Our votes, our signs waved high, and our social media posts won't do that. It all comes together under a banner of grace and love, only found through hearts turned heavenward, seeking to pull the scorched, aching hearts of this world, under the cool umbrella of Christ.


We don't dare neglect our commission to share the good news, but we press into the hearts of people to do so. We proudly bear the name of Jesus, but we do so with gentleness and respect.

""...but honor the Messiah as Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. However, do this with gentleness and respect, keeping your conscience clear, so that when you are accused, those who denounce your Christian life will be put to shame."" 1 Peter 3:15-16

No shouting or shunning is required to bring the good news to those who need it. Less debate and drama, more Jesus, please. To live at peace with those around us may require a heaping dose of humility and hearts surrendered. Our battle is not against flesh and blood, but it goes far deeper, beyond the reaches of this world (Eph. 6). Friends, let's lay down our signs, and extend a hand. We can be firm in our convictions, without scarring people in the process. Seek out wisdom from above, gentleness and peace, and I believe you will be a difference maker.",660,"I want to be difference maker. I know you do too.

Something was definitely out of whack at Friday night’s game in Marble Falls. Only it was what the John Jay High School players did to the referee, one slamming him to the ground, another piling on after the fall.

Avoiding physical contact with football players is something Bill and every ref has to master. 
 
“Position yourself so you allow yourself enough room between the ball-carriers or the players, so that you can get out of the way,” says Bill. 
 
Whether Friday night’s collision was preventable is now up to investigators to decide. The Marble Falls Police Department is leading this investigation. They say once all the interviews are done, they will present the case to the Burnet County attorney’s office, and if they decide to prosecute, then arrests will be made.

a890451b-4d4f-481b-9cba-24a630759b70,How To Make Butterscotch Pudding from Scratch — Cooking Lessons from The Kitchn,Blog,"The Kitchn | Inspiring cooks, nourishing homes","Pin it Open Cooking Lesson Keep your pie, your layer cake, your tiramisu and your tortes. When it comes to dessert, there is one old-fashioned showstopper that I know will win hearts and minds every single time — and that is butterscotch pudding, made from scratch. Butterscotch pudding is my thing, you guys. It evokes wonder and amazement — did you really make this from scratch? — and yet it is so easy and homey, made from fresh milk and cream, right on your stovetop. From my kitchen to yours, here is your step-by-step guide to perfect butterscotch pudding. Pin it I remember the first time I ever made butterscotch pudding — it was a rich, eggy recipe that yielded thick, creamy custard that tasted like butter and brown sugar (that's all butterscotch is — butter and brown sugar cooked together). My guests raved; I couldn't believe how easy it was. You mean that boxed pudding wasn't the only way to go? I was hooked. Many batches of pudding later, and with one whole book about pudding and other no-bake desserts ushered out into the world, I can say pretty confidently that I know pudding well. But butterscotch is still my favorite, hands down. Pin it This is a really simple recipe. You just have to be comfortable cooking sugar on the stove — remember, it gets really hot, and it's important to practice good safety measures when cooking sugar, especially when it's mixed with butter like this. Use a deep saucepan and go slowly. Once it's done you'll see just how deeply pleasurable it is to make homey, old-fashioned pudding from scratch. There are so many advantages to pudding: You can make it ahead; it's nearly always gluten-free; it can be eaten warm or cold. But in the end, the chief pleasure of pudding, in my mind, is the deep nostalgia and homey comfort of a dish pudding, eaten with a spoon. Happy pudding! Ingredients for butterscotch pudding. How To Make Butterscotch Pudding from Scratch Makes eight 1/2-cup servings. Adapted from Bakeless Sweets by Faith Durand. What You Need Ingredients
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cups whole milk
3 large egg yolks, beaten
4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) unsalted butter
3/4 cup tightly packed dark brown sugar
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract Equipment
Large bowl
Whisk with a long handle
4-quart saucepan
Hot pads or oven mitts
Shallow glass container with lid Fine mesh strainer (optional)
Plastic wrap or wax paper Instructions Make a cornstarch slurry: Whisk the cornstarch with the salt in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth. (If you want to be sure you didn't miss any lumps, reach into the bowl and gently rub out any lumps between your fingers.) Whisk in the egg yolks: Whisk in the egg yolks and set the bowl aside. Melt the butter and brown sugar: To make the butterscotch, melt the butter in a deep 4-quart pan set over medium-high heat. When it has melted completely, whisk in the sugar. Cook the butter and brown sugar: The sugar will look lumpy and grainy at first. Whisk vigorously with the butter. As it melts it will smooth out and then become a liquid bubbling mass. Whisk the melted sugar until it emulsifies: You will see the melted butter pooling up around the sugar; keep whisking until the butter and brown sugar are smooth and homogenized. Cook just until smoke appears: Continue cooking the brown sugar until a small amount of smoke appears. Immediately remove the pan from the heat. (Be careful! The sugar is very hot.) Whisk in the cream: Slowly whisk in the cream. Be very careful as you do this; the cream and sugar will steam up violently. Whisk thoroughly. It is normal for the sugar to seize into small, hard bits as the cream is added. Return to low heat and continue whisking until the sugar has melted. Temper the cornstarch slurry: Add most of the hot butterscotch liquid to the bowl with the eggs and milk and whisk. Return to the pan and cook: Return the tempered slurry to the pan to cook. Raise the heat to medium-high. Whisk thoroughly and energetically (it's a workout!) as it comes to a full, rolling boil. Boil for 2 minutes: Once the pudding comes to a full rolling boil, with popping bubbles of pudding, continue whisking and cook for 2 minutes. Then remove the pan from the heat and turn off the stove. Strain into a container (optional): For smoothest results, strain the pudding through a fine mesh strainer into a glass container. (This step is optional but it does make the pudding silkier.) Cover the surface directly with plastic wrap or wax paper: This prevents a ""pudding skin"" from forming. Refrigerate for up to 3 days: Chill for at least an hour or up to 3 days. To serve, whip lightly: Whip lightly with a whisk or the paddle of a stand mixer to make the pudding extra creamy for spooning and serving. Recipe Notes Butterscotch Flavor: Truly traditional butterscotch doesn't get cooked quite to smoking. I like a hint of smokiness in my butterscotch, but if you prefer yours milder then take the butter and brown sugar off the heat as it forms a bubbling, molten mass, and do not wait to see any smoke. To Serve: I love butterscotch pudding with whipped cream, of course, but also try it with creme fraîche and a sprinkle of salt or turbinado sugar.

15e8a051-57ad-461b-a489-0ae3f3ab18c7,Mobile phone bills could rise as Ofcom trebles annual fees for operators,News,Yahoo! UK and Ireland,"Mobile phone customers could face higher bills after Ofcom announced it is to treble annual fees for operators. 

The regulator has concluded that operators should pay a combined annual total of £199.6 million per year for the 900MHz and 1800 MHz spectrum bands, which are used for 2G, 3G and 4G voice and data services.

The figure is 13% lower than Ofcom's earlier proposals in February but more than three times the current fee.

The fees vary for each operator depending on the bandwidth they use.

Vodafone and EE will see their fees more than triple from £15.6 million a year to £49.6 million, while EE's charges will rise from £24.9 million to £75 million and Three's will change from £8.3 million to £25 million.

Half the increase will be payable in from October 31 and the second half a year later, with full fees payable annually from that point.

Ofcom's group director of spectrum, Philip Marnick, said: ""We have listened carefully to the arguments and evidence put forward by industry, and conducted a complex and comprehensive analysis to determine the new fees.

""The mobile industry has not previously had to pay market value for access to this spectrum, which is a valuable and finite resource, and the new fees reflect that value.""

The price comparison site cable.co.uk said it was fair for providers to pay for a finite resource but warned the money ""has to come from somewhere"".

Dan Howdle, the site's telecoms spokesman, said: ""There can be absolutely no doubt as to the fairness of simply ensuring the UK's mobile network providers pay a fair price for what is absolutely a finite resource.

""But, of course, the money has to come from somewhere. And while, on paper, O2, Vodafone, Three and EE appear in arguably rude health from the perspective of their announced operating profits earlier this year, behind closed doors they are unlikely be happy to see their war chest diminished.

""That Ofcom is 'phasing in' the move to a yearly lump-sum payment for the licence fees will make it especially difficult to detect when, if and how these costs will be passed on to consumers, either directly or indirectly via the fees paid by mobile virtual network operators such as Virgin Mobile and giffgaff to piggyback their network infrastructure.""

Ofcom said it did not agree that bills would have to rise as a result of the fees increase.

A spokesman said: ""Mobile operators have a strong incentive to keep prices competitive. The operators have had five years' notice that the fees would be increased to reflect full market value and we expect them to have budgeted for this. 

""The fees announced today are in line with analysts' expectations and with the amounts that operators pay for accessing spectrum in other countries.""",465,"Mobile phone customers could face higher bills after Ofcom announced it is to treble annual fees for operators.

It's a free event, where normal lectures are cancelled for the day and every faculty across the University hosts lectures regarding the Kingitanga or research topics regarding Māori.  Students and the wider community are able to attend, listen, learn and participate in the various lectures and workshops throughout the day across campus. 
 
This year’s keynote address was by leading Māori Military Historian, Dr Monty Soutar, ONZM, called Whitiki! Whiti! Whiti e! – which was the call to arms used to encourage Māori to enlist in World War 1 - taken from traditional pā warfare.   
 
Dr Soutar says he felt privileged to speak at the event, and was aware of the importance in understanding the King Movements stance regarding the early wars. 
 
Other speakers of the day include Waikato University Senior Lecturer Tom Roa, who spoke about the film Ngā Rā o Hune which told the story of men who were forcibly sent to Narrow Neck Military Camp.

7a7f7e61-cbfb-4bcb-831f-4ebd9e3ec7db,Ultragenyx Announces Presentation of Data From Long-Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorder Patients With Cardiomyopathy Treated With Triheptanoin,News,Financial Content,"NOVATO, Calif., Sept. 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced the presentation of open-label data from five infants with cardiomyopathy due to long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) treated with triheptanoin (UX007). Severely affected LC-FAOD patients can present early in life with severe cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, heart failure, hypoglycemia, hepatic dysfunction, and rhabdomyolysis that can lead to death. The data were presented at the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism (SSIEM) Annual Symposium in Lyon, France.

""Some LC-FAOD patients can progress to severe and life-threatening cardiomyopathy while on standard of care,"" commented Sunil Agarwal, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Ultragenyx. ""We are encouraged by the preliminary results presented at SSIEM indicating the potential to help these severely affected patients."" Case reports from five infant patients with moderate or severe cardiomyopathy due to LC-FAOD were presented. All patients were detected by newborn screening and managed with standard treatment, including medium-chain triglyceride oil. While on the standard of care, the patients were hospitalized with heart failure that required cardiac support (ventilation, ECMO, vasopressors) and, in some cases, resuscitation. The patients discontinued medium-chain triglyceride oil and then began to receive triheptanoin on an expanded access basis.

All patients demonstrated an improvement in ejection fraction (EF), a measure of cardiac function evaluated by echocardiogram, after treatment with triheptanoin. The improvements in EF began between two days and three weeks following initiation of treatment with triheptanoin and were associated with stabilization of the clinical signs of cardiomyopathy in these patients. Additionally, EF continued to improve or was maintained with further treatment. In patients with known EF values before and after treatment (n=4) the mean EF prior to triheptanoin was 32% (range: 21% to 44%) and after treatment at last assessment was 66% (range: 55% to 71%).

The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal distress, including loose stools. One patient discontinued treatment after approximately 14 weeks due to gastrointestinal symptoms. No other significant tolerance issues or treatment-related adverse events were reported. Four of the patients continue to receive triheptanoin. These data are from an expanded access program and are based on open-label uncontrolled treatment, which limits definitive conclusions about efficacy and safety.

Ultragenyx is conducting a separate Phase 2 study of triheptanoin in patients with LC-FAOD. The musculoskeletal and liver manifestations of the disease represent the most prevalent symptoms in the patients enrolled in the Phase 2 study. Data from the study are expected by the end of 2015.

Orphan Designation Granted in Europe

In addition to the previously granted orphan medicinal product designation of Very Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, the European Commission has recently granted orphan medicinal product designation for triheptanoin for the treatment of three other subtypes of LC-FAOD: Long-Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency, Trifunctional Protein (TFP) deficiency, and Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II (CPT-II) deficiency. These four subtypes are estimated to represent more than 90% of the patients born with LC-FAOD each year.

The European Commission grants orphan drug status for medicinal products intended to treat diseases or conditions that affect fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. The designation provides certain benefits and incentives in the EU, including protocol assistance, fee reductions, and ten years of market exclusivity once the medicine is on the market.

Ultragenyx already holds orphan drug designation for triheptanoin for the treatment of LC-FAOD from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as for the treatment of glucose transporter type-1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1 DS) from both the U.S. FDA and European Commission.

About LC-FAOD and Triheptanoin

LC-FAOD are a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by metabolic deficiencies in which the body is unable to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy. The inability to produce energy from fat can lead to severe depletion of glucose in the body, and serious liver, muscle, and heart disease, which can lead to hospitalizations or early death. LC-FAOD are included in newborn screening panels across the U.S. and in certain European countries. LC-FAOD patients are currently treated with the avoidance of fasting, low-fat/high carbohydrate diets, carnitine, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil, a medical food product. Despite current therapy, many patients have significant metabolic events including hospitalizations and mortality due to LC-FAOD.

Triheptanoin, also known as UX007, is a purified, pharmaceutical-grade, specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound created via a multi-step chemical process. It is an investigational medicine intended to provide patients with medium-length, odd-chain fatty acids that can be metabolized to increase intermediate substrates in the Krebs cycle, a key energy-generating process. Unlike typical even-chain fatty acids, triheptanoin can be converted to new glucose through the Krebs cycle, potentially providing an important added therapeutic effect, particularly when glucose levels are too low.

bb4ad019-2651-4a45-a96f-d9bfd6cdea66,[LISTEN] Zak Abel - Running From Myself,Blog,It's All Indie :,"Ok, so ""Running From Myself"" may not be the track that's getting most of the plays over on wonder-teen Zak Abel's latest soundcloud playlist (""One Hand On The Future""), but it sure as hell got this authors attention right from the oh-so-funky beginning. 
With a lyrical profoundness and depth beyond his meagre 19 years, Zak expresses his doubt and inner turmoil with ease, opening the first verse with ""Ever felt like going somewhere else? Away from all this chaos. I've been questioning my mental ill"". But its not just the lyrics that show maturity - his strong distinctive and soulful vocals (think Bill Withers and Gil Scott-Heron) are just the right balance for the track, being expressive and gravelly but at times as smooth as melted chocolate.  Hailing from North London, Zak has been writing since he was 15 and signed his first record deal at 17. He's even featured on the epic Wookie track ""Higher"" and has been seen most recently performing with Gorgon City. The track develops. The funk increases. What's that? Your foot just won't stop tapping? Mine neither and I'm pretty confident that you'll find yourself singing that vocal/double bass hook for days.

1ae5ace1-a6c7-4573-8e19-9b3731b8debf,Marlins hold off Brewers for 9-6 victory,News,Belleville News Democrat,"In recent weeks, manager Craig Counsell has talked about the opportunities being given players as his Milwaukee Brewers embark on what has the makings of a long and painful rebuilding program. 

Tyler Cravy has been given one of those chances, and suffice it to say he is not taking advantage of it. 

In his fifth big-league start, the rookie right-hander had his worst outing yet Tuesday night as the equally woeful Miami Marlins thumped the Brewers, 9-6, to take their second straight in the series. 

Cravy and reliever David Goforth just could not get the third outs of inning without damage being done. The Marlins scored nine runs off that duo and all came with two down, with six coming across after the first two batters were retired. 

In 22/3 innings, Cravy allowed seven hits, three walks and seven runs, though only four were earned. Over four starts since replacing struggling veteran Kyle Lohse in the rotation, he is 0-4 with a 9.00 ERA, with 27 hits, 10 walks and 21 runs (18 earned) in 18 innings. 

One has to wonder if Cravy (0-5, 6.67) will stay in the rotation or someone else will be given a chance. With several off-days in the schedule coming up, Counsell will have leeway to skip turns in his rotation if so desired. 

Cravy has had issues of late getting through lineups the third time, but this night the Marlins got to him early and often. With one down in the first inning, Ichiro Suzuki (4-for-5) singled into the hole at short and Martin Prado was hit by a pitch. 

Justin Bour flied out to left, but Cravy walked Derek Dietrich to load the bases and former Brewers prospect Cole Gillespie cleared them with a triple into the right-field corner. 

The third inning became a complete debacle for Cravy and the Brewers' defense as the Marlins scored four more times to go up, 7-0. And it all began with two outs and no one on base. 

Dietrich doubled to right-center and Gillespie followed with a walk. Adeiny Hechavarria singled to center to score Dietrich, and when Logan Schafer's throw home was wild, Gillespie also came around to score. Second baseman Elian Herrera then muffed Tomas Telis' grounder as another run scored. 

A single by pitcher Adam Conley and another by Dee Gordon plated another run, and when Suzuki collected his second hit to load the bases, Cravy was done. Goforth came on to pop up Prado, who made two outs in the inning. 

Given that seven-run lead, Conley proceeded to cave in during a four-run fourth that chased him from the game. Hernan Perez singled in the first run, Herrera doubled in two more and Jean Segura's two-out hit delivered the fourth to cut Miami's lead to 7-4. 

But the two-out runs kept coming. After two were down in the top of the fifth, the Marlins scored twice, with Suzuki and Prado singling in runs off Goforth. 

With Cravy going out so early, Counsell had to chew through his bullpen, including Will Smith and Jeremy Jeffress, relievers he prefers to use when the team is leading, not trailing. 

The Marlins were not content to breeze to victory, however. With Hechevarria's second error of the game in the ninth keeping the game alive and allowing a run to score, the Brewers got the potential tying run to the plate in Adam Lind, who walked to force in another run. 

That brought to the plate Herrera, who struck out against A.J. Ramos to end a very ugly game.",592,"In recent weeks, manager Craig Counsell has talked about the opportunities being given players as his Milwaukee Brewers embark on what has the makings of a long and painful rebuilding program.

8feee8ef-1fa0-4224-a26f-74db35fd4d70,Givenchy Opens New York Flagship Store,Blog,Fucking Young!,"French couture house, Givenchy announced the opening of a flagship store in one of the world’s most important fashion capitals, New York on the renowned Madison Avenue. 
 
This milestone in the House’s retail development is the latest in its strategy of creating ‘tailor-made’ stores and reinforces its long held relationship with the city of New York. The flagship store brings together every facet of the Givenchy brand and showcases its full ranges to one of the most demanding markets in the world. 
 
According to Givenchy Chief Executive Officer, Philippe Fortunato, “ The new Madison Avenue store is a beacon among Givenchy stores. Every single store has to be great in its own way, projecting the house’s values. But a flagship store is even stronger, in this case attracting influential customers and style leaders of the Upper East Side, New York city and the rest of the US market. These customers will feel ‘at home’ in these surroundings and will welcome a new audience to join the Givenchy “tribe or family .” 
 
Givenchy delivers the expected in an unexpected way in its New York home, It recalls the city surrounding it while bringing the essence of Givenchy to its citizens and customers. In this Riccardo Tisci designed boutique, a simple façade invites visitors into the 400m2 space, which is arranged across a double height main floor, with a mezzanine floating above the rear. The understated backdrop of the store throws oversized images from Givenchy advertising campaigns into sharp relief. The overall impression is that of an art gallery with carefully curated spaces dedicated to the house of Givenchy. 
 
Contrasts and disruption are present throughout the store and are part of Creative Director, Riccardo Tisci’s approach; he has taken a piece of SoHo and placed it at the heart of Madison Avenue. To this end, many of the features in the store are surprising and offer the customer an enriching experience. He has retained the essential elements of the Givenchy store design DNA such as large black and white blocks, complemented by long podiums which are also rendered in black and white. Riccardo Tisci describes them as being “ slender and sleek. Here purity is lined to punk, the richness of the clothes is contrasted to the day-to-day life of the street outside. Each collection has tensions within it and the architecture of this store has its own contradictions. This is an expression of luxury that is not related to social status, it is a lifestyle and membership of a family .” 
 
Riccardo Tisci has created a unique environment where the clothes appear as specimens in a laboratory. They are laid out on plinths rather than hanging on rails or mannequins. Each display is a masterpiece in itself and is therefore at the service of the product. 
 
He continues, “ A journey through the store is a new and intriguing experience because visitors will see a space rather than an array of goods. These spaces are important, they are like the pauses in a piece of music. Space is part of the luxury of our stores. They are clean and calm, creating a churchlike atmosphere where people may even feel compelled to speak in hushed voices. The lack of decoration implies a sense of humility. The store is understated, it has an emptiness and offers pure space. You enter as yourself, on your own and leave as a member the Givenchy ‘tribe’ which describes an attitude, your clothes, and an openness to sharing ideas, while embracing the spirit of the brand .”

""Honey bees are great pollinators, but not the best for every crop,"" said Dr. Theresa Pitts-Singer 

Honey bees and bumble bees, are only two of 20,000 bee species worldwide. For instance, most bees don't live in colonies, but are solitary. Native solitary bees, like blue orchard bees, tend to be less defensive than social bees and better suited for backyard habitat. 

""The Pollinator Symposium is our way of including the public in our love of bees. It's a chance to learn, not only about the species OBA focuses on, but about many of the other bee species that our world depends on for food and ecosystem services,"" said Dr. Cory Stanley-Stahr

The meeting was to discuss ways for U.S. orchard growers around the world cell phones to help gentlemen, grandparents, and late-term mothers support their own family by contacting about 25 or so"," to share some passion with those brave young adults who try their hand at finding honey."" In this year - which was also devoted mainly towards collecting information on New York State native flowers from around San Francisco-- members gathered over 30 organizations that had asked questions about new research results out in Maryland they thought might have implications outside North America since then: how many African American babies were born when pollen allergies began first causing premature birth defects among Hispanic women? What should these associations mean beyond just health issues – more food laws being proposed throughout each state; efforts against environmental injustice leading up into next door states such as Georgia coming under stricter standards regarding chemicals used by growers), whether pesticides could impact local agriculture while expanding farmers' legal rights if there wasn%reduction rates associated wth concerns raised above all else?"" Well it turns after much discussion between fellow attendees I took notes saying YES NO!! We really did look forward getting back together again one last time because we didn0m find any negative feedback either :) Thank you both so"

8aff6ff4-df59-4ec0-932d-ff6539abd5df,5 dramatic cloud computing fails,Blog,Rickscloud,"Cloud computing provides a great number of benefits for both businesses and casual users, but while cloud servers may “live” in fluffy, perfectly white shapes in the sky, they are not immune to human errors. Most of us have heard about at least one cloud failure over the past few years, and some of us have been directly affected by one. 
 
While cloud technologies and security mechanisms continue to grow, they still suffer the same types of issues as in house infrastructures. However, the main difference is that cloud failures usually impact many more users than an in house problem would, and have greater visibility when problems appear. So, let’s have look at some of the most dramatic cloud failures that happened recently: 
    Dropbox forgot the door open   
Dropbox allowed anyone to access customer data simply by entering an email address of the customer. No password was required. This huge security misstep, caused by a bug in a code update, lasted four hours before it was discovered and fixed. 
   CloudFlare brought down 785,000 websites   
Some cloud providers offer Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) tools designed to secure a customer's online presence and improve website uptime. However, in some cases the SaaS cloud that is supposed to help improve uptime has the exact opposite effect. Such was the case when CloudFlare's edge routers were upgraded simultaneously, which caused them all to crash. As a result, approximately 785,000 customer websites were unavailable for about an hour. 
   Office 365 and the email outages   
There are two IT related events that can bring a company to a complete pause. One is a total Internet outage, and the other is a company email outage. The Microsoft Office 365 cloud platform has been guilty of the latter several times since the service first launched. They actually got to a point that the running joke was that the service should be called Office 360, since it's not available five days out of the year. 
   Single system administrator brings down the cloud at Joyent   
Joyent is well known as one of the biggest large scale service providers, so one would think that policies, procedures, and access controls in such large data centers would be in place. However, human error is always a risk, and a single Joyent systems administrator was responsible for simultaneously rebooting every server instance in its data center for about an hour. 
   LastPass got hacked   
LastPass is a very well known provider of cloud-based single sign-on and password manager. Enterprise administrators around the globe use it to manage and secure passwords across their infrastructure. However, in June, LastPass CEO Joe Siegrist admitted in a blog post that a network compromise resulted in the theft of customer email addresses and password reminders. Even though the passwords were encrypted, and there was no evidence of customer data being exposed, LastPass required all customers to change their master passwords the next time they logged in. 
 
While many of the outages listed in this article could have been avoided, sometimes human error is unavoidable. Advances in automation and security will help to reduce these types of cloud failures. Finally, I’d love to hear which fail you found to be the most dramatic and why. Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

So far only two organizations were able (through formal complaints) comply with SAE regulations regarding virtualized environments where systems could fail within 24-48 hours after installation/repair – most had no warning during their attempts anyway… There really seems less need now because we live under enormous financial constraints due towards lower utilization costs versus energy prices per year — especially without cost sharing like other industries do; those who know how this works can clearly tell what needs to change next...

I thought it would be nice to celebrate my last year as a twenty something by reviewing the most powerful financial lessons I’ve learned in the last decade. 
 # 1 – You Can Do Anything You Put Your Mind To  
This lesson can be applied to life in general but for me it had a huge impact on my career. 
 
I’ve went from earning $20,000 per year to almost $70,000 this year. My favorite part is that I don’t have a college degree! 
 
I’ve always been ambitious and when I figured out that I had a much better shot at “making it” on the internet than I did in my small town, I went for it. I persevered even when I was told no a hundred times. 
 
Seriously, you can do anything you put your mind to no matter what people tell you. If you want something bad enough you’ll make it happen. 
 # 2 – Strong Goals are Needed for Financial Success  
Without strong financial goals there’s simply no reason to work hard. I’ve been consistently setting strong goal the past several years. 
 
These goals have guided me and helped to keep pushing forward even when I wanted to give up. 
 # 3 – Investing is Easy  
I used to be extremely intimidated by investing. It scared me and I just didn’t understand it. 
 
I jumped into investing making several mistakes. I learned from my mistakes and discovered that my problem was that I was overcomplicating things. Now I let Betterment do most of the work for me while investing in a few dividend stocks. 
 
It’s shockingly simple. 
 # 4 – There’s Always Something to Learn  
The older I get the more my money mindset changes. There’s always something new to be learned. Luckily, I consider learning about personal finance fun. 
 
Yes, I am THAT dorky. 
 # 5 – Money Buys Freedom  
When you have the right financial plan in place money can buy you a whole lot of freedom. I’m now in a spot where I don’t have to worry about money and that feels amazing. 
 
While I’m not technically financially free yet I am in a place where my husband and I could both lose our jobs and be fine for a year. Plus, referring back to point #1 I feel pretty darn confident in my money-earning abilities. 
 
What are some of your biggest money lessons from your twenties?

The blow is a big one, especially considering that while playing on a torn up knee, he still led the team in tackles in Saturday's win over Virginia. 

On Monday, Angus McClure outlined a plan for Vanderdoes and explained who will step up in his absence. 

""I'm going to put him on the same plan that I put together for Owa (Odighizuwa) a couple years ago and that will be essentially staying ahead of us in our preparations,"" UCLA's D-line coach said.

TORONTO , Sept. 11, 2015 /CNW/ - True North Apartment Real Estate Investment Trust (""True North"")(TSX:TN.UN,TN.DB) today announced that it has filed on SEDAR and is mailing a Letter to Unitholders, Notice of Meeting and Management Information Circular in respect of a special meeting of Unitholders scheduled for October 14, 2015 in Calgary, Alberta . 
 
The documents present the reasons for the unanimous recommendation from True North's Board of Trustees that unitholders vote IN FAVOUR of a proposed plan of arrangement (""Plan of Arrangement"") with Northern Property Real Estate Investment Trust (""NPR"")(TSX:NPR:UN), among others. As announced on August 10, 2015 , pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, NPR will acquire all of True North's properties as well as two additional portfolios comprising 4,650 suites (collectively, the ""Institutional Portfolio"") from affiliates of Starlight Investments Ltd. (""Starlight"") as well as from a joint venture between affiliates of Public Sector Pension Investment Board and affiliates of Starlight. As part of this transaction, the new REIT will be named Northview Apartment Real Estate Investment Trust (""Northview"") to reflect the new national character of Northview's portfolio and its future growth strategy. 
 
""This transaction provides True North unitholders with a compelling opportunity to participate in the creation of Northview – a significantly larger, financially stronger REIT that will be well positioned to deliver sustainable and growing distributions to unitholders,"" said True North President and CEO Leslie Veiner . ""It creates immediate value for unitholders, increases liquidity and accelerates our efforts to increase the REIT's scale. This is an excellent value-enhancement opportunity for True North and its unitholders."" 
 
The transaction also provides True North unitholders a number of compelling benefits, including: 
 
Stronger financial position and record of distribution growth   
 Financial stability – Northview will have a target funds from operations payout ratio of under 70%, a more sustainable level than True North's current payout ratio. 
 Stronger financial position – Upon completion of the transaction, leverage at Northview will be 59%, which is lower than True North's current leverage level of 63%. 
 Potential for increased distributions over time – NPR has a history of regularly increasing its distributions, having raised its distributions eight times over the past 13 years, delivering total growth of 41.7% at a compound annual growth rate of 2.7%. 

Immediate scale, growth and diversification   
 Achieves True North's goal of creating scale – Northview will have a national portfolio of more than 24,000 residential suites in more than 60 markets across eight provinces and two territories, and will be the third largest publicly traded multi-family REIT in Canada . Assembling a portfolio of this nature on an asset-by-asset basis would take considerable time and involve increased costs and transaction risks. 
 Expanded field of opportunity – Northview will benefit from an expanded geographic footprint and a resulting increase in potential growth opportunities in new markets across Canada . 
 Complementary property portfolio – NPR's strength in the west and north will combine with True North's strength in central and eastern Canada to create a truly national platform. 
 Enhanced access to capital to fuel growth; increased liquidity – Northview is expected to have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion , which should broaden and deepen its access to capital, provide unitholders of Northview with increased market liquidity and, over time, reduce Northview's cost of capital. 
 Future growth potential – While True North has a track record of growth, management believes that this transaction greatly enhances our ability to pursue new acquisition opportunities. 
Continued Relationship with Starlight 
 Access to suites that could be included in future transactions – True North unitholders have benefitted from True North's association with Starlight, which manages, and has interests in one of the largest privately-held residential portfolios in Canada . Management believes continuing the relationship with Starlight will provide the opportunity to access and consider further residential acquisition opportunities and benefit from Starlight's extensive industry contacts. Following this transaction, Daniel Drimmer and his affiliates will continue to hold interests in approximately 12,000 suites in Canada that could be part of future transactions. Upon completion of the Plan of Arrangement, Mr. Drimmer , President and Chief Executive Officer of Starlight, will be the largest unitholder in Northview, holding approximately 14.5%. 
Management depth and continuity   
 Proven management team with a track record of growth – Unitholders of Northview will benefit from the continuity of a proven management team and experienced trustees with intimate knowledge of the entire portfolio. Leslie Veiner , President and Chief Executive Officer of True North since 2012, will continue with Northview as Chief Operating Officer, working with proven leaders from NPR in Todd Cook , Chief Executive Officer and Rob Palmer , Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Veiner's addition will support the integration of True North's properties into Northview. 
 Northview will be internally managed – Starlight will initially oversee the asset management of its former properties on a transitional basis with Northview's assets becoming internally managed by no later than the end of 2018, under the proven model currently employed by NPR . 
The complete Letter to Unitholders, along with the Notice of Meeting and Management Information Circular, is available on www.northviewreit.com and on SEDAR, www.sedar.com. 
 
Additional transaction details 
 
Under the Plan of Arrangement, each holder of trust units of True North (other than a registered holder who has validly exercised its dissent rights) will receive 0.3908 of a trust unit of NPR (""NPR Ordinary Unit""). Class B limited partnership units of True North's limited partnerships, which are currently exchangeable for trust units of True North, will be exchanged or become exchangeable (at the election of the holder) for 0.3908 of an NPR Ordinary Unit, and their related True North special voting unit will be cancelled. 
 
The consideration offered to True North unitholders represented a premium of 16.4% over the closing price of True North units on Friday, August 7 , the day prior to the transaction being announced. 
 
Voting Instructions and Unitholder Meeting Information 
 
True North unitholders are recommended to vote in favour of the special resolution by voting their proxy or voting instruction form IN FAVOUR of the Plan of Arrangement by no later than the deadline of 10:00 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time / 12:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Friday October 9, 2015 .   The record date has been set at September 4, 2015 .  Further information on voting can be found in the Management Information Circular.

In addition, True North has formed a soliciting dealer group and engaged CIBC as a soliciting dealer manager in connection with the special meeting. 
 
CIBC will form and manage a soliciting dealer group comprised of members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada to solicit proxy votes from retail unitholders in favour of the Plan of Arrangement.

Cape Town – Movie channel Studio Universal (DStv 112) will change its on-screen look on Thursday on MultiChoice's DStv satellite pay-TV platform. 

The channel from MNCUniversal International Networks (NBCUIN) – part of NBCUniversal – is rolling out the brand refresh for Studio Universal in South Africa and Africa first, before the global refresh moves to other territories and countries like Latin America, Brazil and Italy over the coming months. 

Red Bee, part of the Ericsson group, was responsible for the refreshed look, logo and on-screen imaging of the new Studio Universal from 1 October, and worked with NBCUIN's in-house creative and marketing team. The Studio Universal website will also be refreshed on Thursday. 

The iconic world of film served as the inspiration of Studio Universal's new look. Studio Universal's look is now ""a confident black and white marque with a cinematic feel"", celebrating every aspect of movies. 

Eight new idents were also created by Red Bee bringing to life Studio Universal and the ""We Are Movies"" tagline. 

Each of the idents draws viewers in to carefully choreographed scenes, providing a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the people whose skill and dedication bring stories to life and reflecting the audience's emotional connection to the movies. 

Each ident – shot on location at Universal Studios in Hollywood – has an opposite version, either light or dark in tone, which uses the same set,key actors and props unveiling a very different scene and emphasising the magic of cinema.

bdaf2b6f-73be-49fb-8fb8-9295302d3c0b,Vexillologist: What your flag choice says about your personality,News,The Press NZ,"Flag expert John Moody believes the Southern Cross will attract traditionalists, while the lone koru and silver fern designs will resonate with people wanting a break from the past. 
   
New Zealand Flag Association president John Moody is in Sydney for the International Congress of Vexillology (study of flags) and a shortlist of four new possible flags has stirred debate among the international delegates. A flag enthusiast since the 1970s, he gives his take on who is most likely to vote for which flag, and why. 



Silver fern, black and blue background 

""That flag would appeal to people who still want something like the Southern Cross, but want a more distinctive break from the past  I would say they are young, professional people who feel comfortable with change and who like the dynamics of a clean, fresh flag flying on the flagpole for New Zealand. It's bold, it's dynamic, clearly states who we are. It's not harking back to the past but projecting itself into the future. The Southern Cross still gives them that familiarity with the current flag. It has the three-colour combination which is recommended by vexillologists."" 



Silver fern, red and blue background 

""It's appealing to traditionalists who grew up with the current flag but are open to change. I would say they are an older person, but they would welcome change if certain elements of our current flag were still included in the new flag. They can see the Southern Cross, it's the same blue, and the red element. It's still got what we have now, but it's still moved on. The red aspect not only represents the British heritage, but also Maori culture, because for them red is a traditional colour."" 



Black and white silver fern 

""It's very bold and dynamic. That flag is more appealing to the artistic community or people who have an alternative point of view, and are completely comfortable with change. They would think the past is the past, and the future is the future, and have a very clear idea of their New Zealand identity. They are probably more of a younger generation. It's very much like the Canadian flag with the maple leaf, it was a complete break, it was distinctly Canadian. This flag says 'this is New Zealand, here we are'."" 
 Ad Feedback    


Koru, black and white background 

""That would be appealing to an alternative community, the artistic community is one that would go for that, perhaps. Interestingly, even though it has that style of koru, it doesn't have the red in it, which is a very important colour to the Maori community, and I think that may be a detraction from that design for some Maori people. The koru flag may not be as appealing because it is too stylised, people are trying to get their heads around what it means. People also need a reference point and the (silver fern with Southern Cross) designs have a reference point and that's the Southern Cross.""

Besides the first sentence sounding like something from an erotic Sonic fanfiction, the above dramatic explanation is one of the prime reasons for why I love gaming so much and more importantly, one of my prime motivations. I’m what you would call a completionist. Someone that plays games and attempts to fully complete them. See everything, do everything, unlock everything and so on. Not the most healthy of motivations, I assure you, since it can take a great big chunk of your life away. 
 
I believe this whole obsession with completing everything I get my hands on comes from the time in my life when I didn’t games on a regular basis. I averaged about two games a month if I’m absolutely lucky and during tough financial times, I obviously didn’t get anything. Games were a precious commodity for me back in the day and the few that I did own, I played the shit out of. These days you can get a ton of great games for absolutely no cost as long as you have basic internet, but I digress. 
 
Completionism is actually a puzzling thing to comprehend. You’re toiling away for weeks trying to get every minuscule amount of content from something and for what? There is literally no point to it. Maybe some bragging rights that will make your e-peen larger for about a few seconds before the person talking to you forgets about the entire conversation in about a minute. In actuality, it’s all about the personal satisfaction. 
 
For the longest time I was an achievement hunter. The illusive 1000 GamerScore for a game was my reason to play games. My GamerScore was massive for the time, being one of the largest in SA. I played some shitty games to get to such a high score, but every time I got full score for a game, a smile went across my face, I breathed a sigh of relief and I felt proud of myself. The more difficult a game, the better I felt. 
 
The first games that I got this feeling with were Assassin’s Creed and Mass Effect, both of which I got a 1000 GamerScore for. Both were incredibly hard to obtain, for an impressionable 14 year old boy anyway, with collectibles that will make you cry and requiring around 7 playthroughs because of some shit achievement design. But I ended up managing it and the level of satisfaction was insane and more importantly, addictive. I couldn’t stop. The games just flew by where I got as many achievements as I can until I found myself playing Surf’s Up and wondering what the hell I’m doing with my life. After that episode I slowed down, but the 1000G train was not stopping. 
 
To this day I still avidly collect trophies (because I migrated to PS4) and I still get that level of satisfaction. I don’t have nearly enough time to commit to completing games like I did and most feature goddamn multiplayer trophies anyway. But I still persist. I noticed this again as I was playing Batman Arkham Knight and feeling the compulsion to do everything I possibly can even if I know I’m probably not going to be able to. It’s also one of the reasons I’ve played Witcher 3 for an unhealthy amount of time as well. 
 
But still, I can’t decide if this completionist tendency is a good or a bad thing. On one hand, I’m fully experiencing games, getting value for my money and becoming quite the proficient gamer. On the other hand, it’s entirely pointless. Nobody has looked at my trophy list and said “holy crap that’s impressive” since I started earning trophies. Also, I’m skimping on other offerings because I’m hung up on completing one game at a time. So many indie games have fallen to the wayside because of my obsessive ways. 
 
Still, I get that level of satisfaction and it is still fulfilling and that should be what matters most. While it would be nice if people did look at my accomplishments, I’ve honestly stopped caring what other people think. I will collect all of these pointless items for a pointless bronze trophy that I’ll add to the 2000 I already have that nobody cares about because that’s what I consider fun. But hey, I consider card pack openings to be stellar entertainment so what do I know. 
 
At the end of the day, I experience games more, even if it’s just superficial. Many people play a game, finish it in a few days and then forget about it. I delve into the nook and crannies, the places that developers put in there to flesh out the experience and go all out. One of the reasons I love open-world games so much is because of the amount of activities I can partake in and there’s a finite number of them I can complete. When they’re done, I can feel a sense of accomplishment. While some might be repetitive and overpopulated, I still enjoy doing them. 
 
And what would this world be if we don’t enjoy what we’re doing? 
 
Any fellow completionists out there? What do you get out of it? 
 
Also, RIP me when Fallout 4 comes out.

d8a2780a-57ff-4d62-bd7c-51930188a0fd,Gauss Surgical to Present Triton at UHC Annual Conference,News,Financial Content,"PRWeb 
Gauss Surgical, Inc. announced today that the company will compete in the annual ""UHC Startup Challenge,"" which will take place on Friday, October 2, in Orlando as part of the ""Advance: UHC Annual Conference 2015."" The company will have the opportunity to present Triton, the world's first and only mobile platform for real-time monitoring of surgical blood loss, to the nearly 2,000 health care professionals in attendance. 

The UHC Startup Challenge provides five digital health care startups the opportunity to present a new, innovative product in front of the conference audience. Audience votes will be tabulated in real-time with the winner being announced at the conclusion of the competition. 
   
""We are honored to have been selected to compete in this year's UHC Startup Challenge and are excited for the opportunity to present Triton to this year's annual meeting attendees,"" said Milton B. McColl, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Gauss Surgical. ""We look forward to sharing Triton's value proposition with such a large group of prospective users who may seek to bring its benefits back to their own operating rooms."" 

During the company's presentation, Gauss will highlight how Triton addresses the critical unmet need for a fast and accurate way to estimate blood loss in the operating room. Current methods of estimating blood loss during surgery based on visual estimation are known to be inaccurate, and clinical studies indicate that the use of blood products beyond a level deemed medically necessary can increase complication rates, ICU days, and overall length of hospitalization. Overuse can also substantially increase the cost of care. 

By leveraging the power of mobile devices in combination with proprietary software, Triton may help to reduce unnecessary transfusions and the associated costs and complications. It offers the potential to not only improve patient outcomes but also conserve health care resources. 

Using the iPad camera, the Triton system scans surgical sponges and blood bearing canisters and sends the images to the cloud where image-processing algorithms estimate the amount of blood contained on that surface and sends it back to the OR in real-time. Triton features an intuitive iPad interface, requires minimal training, and seamlessly integrates into existing surgical workflow. The system is FDA-cleared and fully HIPAA compliant. 

UHC, which recently combined with VHA Inc. to form the largest member-owned health care company in the country, is excited to again host the UHC Startup Challenge. Other companies participating in this year's event include Augmedix, Binary Fountain, Vital Score, Inc., and Wellframe, Inc. Participants were selected in partnership with AVIA Health Innovation, health care's provider-led accelerator.

About Gauss Surgical 

Founded in 2011 and headquartered in Los Altos, Calif. Gauss is developing a mobile vision platform for the Operating Room.

dfabfcf0-5ee4-4aa2-8d50-3544b09def5b,Tony Abbott's final speech as Prime Minister of Australia,News,Walcha News,"Tony Abbott was the 28th Prime Minister of Australia. This is is last speech while holding that office. 

Thank you for being here.

This is not an easy day for many people in this building. Leadership changes are never easy for our country. My pledge today is to make this change as easy as I can.

There will be no wrecking, no undermining and no sniping. I've never leaked or backgrounded against anyone and I certainly won't start now.

Our country deserves better than that.

I want our government and our country to succeed. I always have and I always will. I've consistently said in opposition and in government that being the prime minister is not an end in itself; it's about the people you serve. The great privilege that I have had is to see the wonder of this country like few others. And I want to thank the Australian people for giving me the honour to serve.

Yes, this is a tough day, but when you join the game, you accept the rules. I've held true to what I've believed and I'm proud of what we've achieved over the past two years.

Three-hundred thousand more people are in jobs. Labor's bad taxes are gone. We've signed free trade agreements with our largest trading partners, with Japan, with Korea and with China.

The biggest infrastructure program in our country's history is under way. A spotlight is being shone into the dark and corrupt corners of the union movement and Labor's party-union business model.

We've responded to the threats of terror and we've deployed to the other side of the world to bring our loved ones home.

The boats have stopped and with the boats stopped, we've been better able to display our compassion to refugees. And despite hysterical and unprincipled opposition, we've made $50 billion of repairs to the budget.

Of course, there's much that I had still wanted to do. Constitutional recognition of Indigenous people. Getting the kids to school, the adults to work and communities safe. I was the first prime minister to spend a week a year in remote Indigenous Australia and I hope I'm not the last.

Then there's the challenge of ice and domestic violence yet to be addressed. Australia has a role to play in the struggles of the wider world: the cauldron of the Middle East; and security in the South China Sea and elsewhere.

I fear that none of this will be helped if the leadership instability that's plagued other countries continues to taint us. But yes, I am proud of what the Abbott Government has achieved. We stayed focused despite the white-anting.

Of course, the government wasn't perfect. We have been a government of men and women, not a government of gods walking upon the earth. Few of us, after all, entirely measure up to expectations.

The nature of politics has changed in the past decade. We have more polls and more commentary than ever before. Mostly sour, bitter, character assassination. Poll-driven panic has produced a revolving-door prime ministership which can't be good for our country. And a febrile media culture has developed that rewards treachery.

And if there's one piece of advice I can give to the media, it's this: refuse to print self-serving claims that the person making them won't put his or her name to. Refuse to connive at dishonour by acting as the assassin's knife.

There are many to thank for the privilege of being Prime Minister. First and foremost, I thank my family for allowing me to be the absentee spouse and parent that politics entails. I thank Margie for her grace and dignity throughout my public life. I thank my party for the privilege of leading it. I thank the armed forces who are serving our country and defending our values, even as we speak.

I think my staff, who have been absolutely unceasing in their devotion to our party and our country, especially my chief of staff, who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better.

Finally, I thank my country for the privilege of service. It is humbling to lose, but that does not compare to the honour of being asked to lead.

In my maiden speech here in this Parliament, I quoted from the first Christian service ever preached here in Australia. The reverend Richard Johnson took as his text 'What shall I render unto the Lord for all his blessings to me?'

At this, my final statement as Prime Minister, I say: I have rendered all and I am proud of my service. My love for this country is as strong as ever and may God bless this great Commonwealth.

Thank you. The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",793,"Tony Abbott was the 28th Prime Minister of Australia. This is is last speech while holding that office.

5715e183-bf81-4787-80b1-0eb78b07c999,"Ex-officer charged in South Carolina death speaks out, seeking bond",News,Reuters UK,"CHARLESTON, S.C. A white former police officer told a South Carolina judge on Friday that he was not a flight risk and should be released on bond while awaiting his trial in death of an unarmed black man who was shot in the back while fleeing a traffic stop. 

Michael Slager, 33, spoke in court for the first time since he was arrested in April in the death of Walter Scott, 50. 

He was charged with murder after a bystander's cellphone video showed the officer firing his gun eight times at Scott's back as the motorist ran away. No trial date has been set. 

""I would like to be with my family,"" said Slager, now the father of a baby boy born after his arrest, according to court records. 

Judge Clifton Newman pledged to make a decision ""as expeditiously as possible"" on whether Slager should be released on bond. He has been jailed since his arrest, and his release is opposed by prosecutors and Scott's family. 
 
Video footage of the shooting in North Charleston drew wide outrage during a year of public debate over police killings of unarmed black men in several U.S. cities. 

Newman, who heard 90 minutes of arguments about the bail and other defense motions on Thursday, is also weighing a request by defense attorneys to know more about the race, gender and backgrounds of the grand jurors who indicted Slager. 
 
Slager's attorney argued in court on Thursday that the former officer and motorist had been engaged in a violent confrontation before the shooting. 

Both sides said scheduling a trial date had been complicated by another high-profile case involving the shooting deaths of nine black churchgoers in Charleston this summer, a case in which Slager's prosecutor and his defense attorney are also involved. 

Solicitor Scarlett Wilson is seeking the death penalty for the accused church shooter, Dylann Roof, and defense attorney Andy Savage is representing the three survivors of the shooting. 
 
The judge requested another hearing later this fall to discuss possible trial dates in 2016. 

A protester outside the courtroom on Friday said she was concerned about police conduct.    ""If he gets out on bail, it shows that North Charleston police will have the mindset of being above the law,"" said Karen Oliver of Charleston.

I made more personal insights than ever about building such books: I love watching news with what gets translated because if it doesn't come my way online you're left in silence – especially readers learning very little during periods like Christmas breaktime where people are not happy due all signs being taken care but after taking away so soon as holiday leave or just sitting at someone's house really don´t learn - which presents me this dilemma :) So then why would any publisher seriously decide going indie? Simply saying ""Maybe start again,"" muching while maintaining something within themselves even before offering these great games comes-out timely; anything beyond those two will be rejected too they'd have no cash cow compared...until now anyway! ******** **This has somehow convinced up some folks back home who never realised publishing wasn�the heart & innermost essence'.'''

8250302b-c954-467b-996d-2194832a2609,Hospital patients 'more likely to die if admitted at weekend',News,Bedford Today,"Patients admitted to NHS hospitals on weekends are more likely to die than if they are admitted during the week, according to a new report. 
 
		 
A lack of consultant cover and ""reduced"" services are contributing to higher death rates, experts behind the study said. 
  Figures confirm that NHS patients are more likely to die if admitted to hospital during the weekend   
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt called the research a ""wake-up call"" and said the situation on weekends may be worse than previously thought. 

			 
The study showed that around 11,000 more  people die every year within 30 days of admission to hospital on  Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday compared with other days  of the week. 



 
Even when taking into account the fact patients admitted on weekends tend to be sicker, people were still 10% more likely to die if admitted on a Sunday compared to a Wednesday. 

For those admitted on a Saturday, there was a 7% increased chance of dying. 

Writing in the British Medical Journal,  the experts said there was a ""clear association"" between weekend admissions and worse outcomes for patients. 

They said ""services inside and outside the hospital are reduced"" on weekends, despite the fact there are more emergency admissions on Saturdays and Sundays. 

			 
The team, from University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trusts and University College London, said hospital services ""are usually reduced from late Friday through the weekend, leading to disruption on Monday morning"". 

This could lead to a ""weekend effect"" extending into Friday and Monday. 

They added: ""There is evidence that junior hospital doctors feel clinically exposed during the weekend and that hospital chief executives are concerned about levels of weekend cover."" 

The experts analysed data for almost 15 million patients admitted to hospital in England in 2013/14. 

			 
Some 2.7 million patients on average were admitted to hospital on each weekday, 1.2 million on average were admitted on a Saturday and one million on a Sunday. 

Mr Hunt, who has warned he is prepared to impose seven-day working on hospital doctors in England, said the research showed the situation may be worse than suspected. 

""That's why we urgently need to modernise the contracts for new consultants to make sure NHS patients do not have to worry about a lack of senior clinical presence if they are admitted to hospital on a Saturday or Sunday,"" he said. 

Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association , said doctors wanted high standard care, seven days a week. 

""Urgent action on this has been undermined by calls for the entire NHS to be delivered on a seven-day basis without any clear prioritisation,"" he said. 

			 
""The BMA wants better access to seven-day urgent and emergency care to be the priority for investment. 

""This will ensure seriously ill patients receive the best care at all times."" 

He said as well as extra doctors, there needed to be greater investment in more nurses, diagnostic and support staff. 

""David Cameron promised a 'truly seven-day NHS' but there has been no detail to define what he means, how he plans to fund and staff it, and its impact on weekday services. 

""Given the current funding squeeze on NHS trusts, the only way for many hospitals to increase the number of doctors over the weekend would be to reduce the number providing care during the week."" 

NHS medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, who worked on the study, said doctors went the extra mile but it was unacceptable that patients were harmed due to how services were organised. 

He said: ""I'm not talking about offering people whatever they want, whenever they want it. The priority is to reduce mortality by concentrating on improving the way we design and deliver urgent care for our sickest patients."" 

The Royal College of Surgeons  president, Clare Marx, said:  ""It is clear that patients that need treating at the weekend are less likely to be seen by the right mix of junior and senior staff, and experience reduced access to diagnostics. 

""Many doctors and NHS staff already work at nights and weekends and they should be valued and thanked for continuing to provide care during those unsocial hours. 

""However, the evidence shows that this is not currently standard practice even in high risk emergency care. This has to change.""

Rocky River 
 
To some, the sound of a train horn at night can be comforting. To others, it’s a nuisance that interrupts their slumber. With an increase in the number of trains rumbling through the city, Mayor Pam Bobst recently met with neighboring mayors as well as congressional representatives and Norfolk Southern Corp. officials to address noise as well as several other issues. 
 
“There is an issue with the train horns. We understand that this is a safety matter, but we want a consistent (volume),” Bobst told West Life. Last fall, the city received word from Norfolk Southern that train traffic would be increased by two to four per day. 
 
The city has received complaints from residents about the noise of the horn blasts, which can be heard throughout the city as trains make their way past four “grade crossings,” where cars and pedestrians cross the tracks, at Elmwood Road, Wagar Road, Morewood Parkway and Linda Street. 
 
“We want to be in front of this issue. We understand the safety (aspect), but we want them to be consistent with the protocol set forth,” Bobst said. 
 
Bobst added that bringing U.S. House of Representatives members Marcy Kaptur and Jim Renacci to the table had been necessary to facilitate discussion with Norfolk Southern. “We weren’t getting the response we wanted in the past,” she stated. 
 
Matthew Dietrich, executive director of the Ohio Rail Development Commission, said when reached by phone that federal law requires engineers to sound the horns in a combination of short and long blasts when approaching grade crossings. “The volume and decibel range can depend on the atmosphere,” Dietrich said, referring to why the horns can sound louder on a summer day or at night. Wind direction and train movement also play a part. 
 
Bobst said that conversations about the establishment of a “quiet zone,” installation of safety equipment at crossings that would cancel the need for horn blowing, was initiated “at a bad financial time,” at the height of the recession in 2008. Regarding the cost for the paraphernalia, which can top $800,000, Bobst stated, “With the one or two trains we had going through the city at the time, it didn’t make sense.” 
 
Dietrich noted that quiet zones can be established by upgrading warning devices with equipment such as “quad gates,” which entirely block the crossing and sidewalk, and a “power out indicator,” which warns engineers of power failures. He said these measures have been taken in North Ridgeville and Vermilion. 
 
“The city has to develop an acceptable situation,” Dietrich said. The proposal must then be presented to the Federal Rail Association. He added that the city would be responsible for the maintenance of this equipment. 
 
Dietrich said that his organization will help provide information that may be used by the city to make these decisions. “We will volunteer to collect technical data to determine what will be needed for the entire corridor,” Dietrich said, adding that the determination of quiet zones needs are made through a formula that considers both train and vehicle traffic. 
 
Aside from horn noise and quiet zone equipment, Bobst noted several other concerns, including access to underutilized railroad property and its maintenance. She pointed out that a number of parking spaces adjacent to the old Rocky River railroad station had been blocked off by Norfolk Southern, which uses the structure for storage. “We could use that parking to support our local (Downtown River) economy,” she added. 
 
In addition, she said that trains shouldn’t be allowed to idle beyond designated sidings, and that parked trains need to be monitored by railroad officers. Bobst noted that last winter, trains were allowed to idle behind residences, near the Elmwood crossing, ahead of the designated siding area. 
 
Bobst also requested that the railroad supply descriptions of rail car contents in the interest of disaster preparedness. She said that this request has been submitted twice, with no response.",654,"By Sue Botos Rocky River To some, the sound of a train horn at night can be comforting.

Last fall, the city received word from Norfolk Southern that operators required that the horns in their trains be linked together, not just with the gauge train horn.

VETalent was created in 2010 at Prudential headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, and has since expanded to many of the company’s other business locations: Dubuque, Iowa; Dresher/Ft. Washington, Pennsylvania; Jacksonville, Florida; Hartford/Shelton, Connecticut; and, most recently, El Paso, Texas. 
 
The first cohort of trainees to graduate from the VETalent training program in El Paso last November spent 4 months in extensive and rigorous job training, which included classroom work at El Paso Community College, job-specific training, and on-the-job training at Prudential El Paso Business & Technology Solutions, a subsidiary of Prudential Financial. They then received additional training as information security administrators before qualifying for full-time careers at Prudential. 
 
Prudential also sponsors VETNET, a business resource group for employees who have military backgrounds or who are interested in veterans’ issues. VETNET provides professional development opportunities, mentoring, and networking programs. 
 
VETalent and VETNET are among the programs offered to veterans through Prudential’s Office of Veterans Initiatives, which “provides job training for sustainable careers in information technology and business operations for service members and their families; professional development services for employees with military backgrounds and those interested in issues related to veterans; thought leadership that encourages corporate peers to adopt programs to help veterans build successful post-military careers; financial and volunteer service support of nonprofit organizations that help military service members and their families who need assistance transitioning back to civilian life; and financial literacy information to help ensure the financial health and wholeness of post-military services members and their families,” the company states. 
 
“We’ve built an infrastructure that provides veterans and military spouses access to quality education, job training, and employment opportunities so that they can better leverage the skills and talent they bring to the workforce,” said Charles Sevola, vice president and head of Prudential’s Veterans Initiatives. 
 
As a result of its commitment to training and hiring veterans and active duty military reservists, Prudential was recognized by Military Times magazine this spring as a “Best for Vets Employer” for the sixth consecutive year. 
 
Learning opportunities also abound for Prudential employees—whether or not they have military experience. For example, the firm’s ongoing efforts to offer “rich learning and development experiences for IT employees” are among the reasons Prudential was recently named one of the “100 Best Places to Work in IT” by Computerworld magazine for the seventh consecutive year. 
 
Last year, Prudential reviewed IT positions across the company to ensure that they were competitively aligned with those in the industry and that employees had a clear career path and talent development opportunities, said Michele Alcazar, vice president, Human Resources at Prudential. IT employees also can participate in employee forums that give them access to senior leadership, encouraging knowledge sharing and networking throughout the organization. 
 
Prudential also offers programs to encourage girls to pursue technology careers. This summer, from mid-July through August, employees mentored 20 New Jersey high school girls in a 7-week Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at company headquarters. Girls Who Code is a national, nonprofit organization that is striving to close the gender gap in computing and technology by inspiring, educating, and equipping girls with computing skills for the 21st century.

c71c5ce7-eff7-4d60-9da5-098276e18602,Michel Platini: Payment delay due to FIFA's financial situation,News,Scarborough Evening News,"Michel Platini has claimed he was not paid money owed by FIFA for more than nine years because of the world governing body's financial situation. 
 
		 
Platini, whose status has been described by the Swiss attorney general as ""in between a witness and accused person"" in the criminal proceedings involving FIFA president Sepp Blatter, said he was still determined to stand for the presidency himself in February. 
  Michel Platini   
The UEFA president said: ""Mr Blatter informed me when I started my role as his advisor [in 1999] that it was not initially possible to pay the totality of my salary because of FIFA's financial situation at that time. 

			 
""I never doubted, however, that the remaining amount owed to me would be paid eventually, so I did not actively pursue it. 



 
""I even put the matter to the side for a while, before finally requesting that the outstanding balance was paid in 2011."" 

FIFA's accounts for the 1999-2002 period shows a deficit of 134million Swiss francs had been estimated after its TV and marketing partners went bankrupt but actually ended the cycle with a revenue surplus of 115million Swiss francs, and in April 2003 Blatter hailed the organisation as ""financially more stable than ever"". 

The timing of the payment to Platini in February 2011 raised questions as it came just after the Frenchman had met Asian football chief Mohamed bin Hammam, who had urged him to stand against Blatter, and two months before UEFA gave its backing to Blatter. 

Platini added: ""The outstanding amount for the work I did was paid when I finally requested it to FIFA. 

			 
""The fact that this payment was made a few months before the FIFA presidential elections is irrelevant since I never had any plans of becoming a candidate. 

""As a matter of fact, I was extremely happy to be re-elected as UEFA President at the UEFA congress in Paris in March of 2011."" 

The Frenchman said he was ""calm and totally serene"" about the investigation ""since I don't have reasons to be concerned"". 

He added: ""I have known for a long time that I would be the target of many unfounded attacks and I am conscious that these attacks will continue until the FIFA elections take place. 

			 
""I am still determined to present myself as a candidate for the FIFA presidency so I can introduce the governance reforms that are necessary to restore the order and credibility to world football. 

""I would also like to put football at the heart of FIFA once again and make sure that we continue to develop this beautiful sport around the planet."" 

Platini's response to his £1.3million payment from FIFA came four days after he was interviewed by officials from the Swiss attorney general's office - he and Blatter are also being investigated by FIFA's ethics committee. 

That committee on Tuesday announced a lifetime ban for former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner over illegal payments - but he claimed there is no coincidence that it has been announced at the same time that FIFA is engulfed by a storm of controversy. 

Warner said in an email to Press Association Sport: ""I left the FIFA in April 2011 and if in September 2015 the FIFA wants to ban me for life without even a hearing then so be it. I do not believe however that this will serve as the distraction to the FIFA's present problems as the FIFA wishes it to be. 

			 
""Given what is happening in Zurich with Blatter I wish to say that there is no such thing as coincidence."" 

The criminal proceedings against Blatter also involves TV rights deals with Warner. 

The Warner ban was issued on the basis of investigations carried out by the investigatory chamber of the ethics committee following its report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process - the Garcia report into the bidding process identified Warner as having received or asked for money, often in the form of development money, from bidders. 

Chung Mong-Joon, the Korean who is running against Michel Platini for the presidency, said FIFA is in ""total meltdown"" and needs to set up an emergency task force to run the organisation until a successor to Blatter is elected. 

Meanwhile, Costa Rican Eduardo Li, one of the seven officials arrested in Zurich in May, has had his extradition to the USA approved by the Swiss federal office of justice (FoJ), though he can appeal.

101629de-6c6f-4eed-8519-33ec82f0968c,The return of cheap gas,News,Click Orlando,"(CNNMoney) -  
The last time Labor Day gas prices were this low, George W. Bush was in his first term as president. 

Prices have been going nowhere but down since June. And according to AAA, the average price of regular gasoline is now $2.40 per gallon -- or more than $1 less than it was a year ago. 

For this weekend, a time when a lot of Americans hop in their cars, prices are at 2004 levels. 
 
The decline has been widespread. Average prices are still above $3 in only four states: California and Nevada, as well as Alaska and Hawaii -- two states where everything is always more expensive. 

Of the country's 130,000 or so gas stations, more than 5% are selling gas for less than $2 a gallon, AAA says. In South Carolina, the statewide average has fallen below $2 in the past week. 

For a lot of people, cheap gas is like getting a raise. The typical driver is saving about $50 a month because gas prices have fallen so much. 

Americans are celebrating their savings. 

Ben Prensky, 32, drove from a Philadelphia suburb to New York City with his family for the weekend. He has an SUV and usually fills up once a week. ""With prices as cheap as they are, it's been a huge help,"" he said. 

Another driver on a #roadtrip tweeted Sunday about spotting gas for $1.99 a gallon in New Jersey. 

Why gas is so cheap 

Gas is cheap largely because the bottom has fallen out on oil prices. Crude accounts for about half the cost of a gallon of gas. 

So as oil goes, so does gas. Oil is trading now at under $46 a barrel. Last summer, oil was at $100 a barrel. 

Oil is bought and sold on world markets and largely driven by supply and demand. 

First, a surge in production from American shale producers has led to a massive glut of oil. 

Normally, when prices fall, OPEC steps in and cuts production. But not this time. The cartel of some of the world's largest oil suppliers -- led by Saudi Arabia -- continues to pump record amounts. 

Some see the move as part of a Saudi strategy to pressure American shale oil producers. 

The fact that Iran may be reopened to Western oil interests, because of the pending sanctions deal, has also helped drive prices lower. 

Not only is there too much supply, but demand for oil has been sluggish. 

Some developed economies in Europe and Asia are barely growing and emerging markets in Latin America are stumbling. Growth in China, the world's second largest economy, has slowed dramatically. Economies need less oil when they cool off. 

Of course, there is one big victim in falling prices: oil jobs. U.S. companies have disclosed at least 86,405 job cuts directly attributed to falling oil prices since June 2014, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. 

Where gas prices are headed 

Gas prices are headed lower still, experts believe. 

The Energy Information Administration, a government agency that tracks the sector, is forecasting that the national average will drop to $2.11 a gallon by the end of this year. 

Why? The supply and demand factors are not expected to change much. Besides, people always drive less after Labor Day, creating even less demand for gasoline, and U.S. refiners switch later this month to a less expensive blend of gas. 

AAA says it believes gas will fall below $2 in many parts of the country by Christmas.

Transport Minister Lisa Raitt speaks in Richmond, B.C., on Tuesday July 7, 2015. Canada's transport minister quietly wrote to the heads of every major airline in the country earlier this year to try and stamp out a practice where parents were being seated separately from their children on flights. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck"" 
  
OTTAWA - Canada's transport minister quietly wrote to the heads of every major airline in the country earlier this year to try and stamp out a practice where parents were being seated separately from their children on flights. 

In the March letter, Lisa Raitt called the issue one ""where logic should prevail"" and encouraged the airlines to ensure parents were seated with their young children whenever possible. 

She asked the airlines to come up with some way to eliminate such incidents, provide ""greater predictability"" to parents and ""minimize the challenges that parents face when they embark on air travel with children."" 

A briefing note accompanying the letter suggests the missive wasn't intended to signal that the federal government was going to legislate an end to the practice by airlines, but to promote what Raitt's officials called ""an industry-led solution to avoid such situations."" 

Still, Transport Canada officials wrote in the briefing note that they were ""exploring opportunities to address this issue and input from air carriers would be useful in that regard."" 

A copy of the letter and briefing note were obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act. 

There are no federal rules requiring parents to be seated next to their children on flights, nor is it a guarantee under airline policy that a parent or guardian will automatically get a seat next to children under age 12. 

In dismissing a complaint against six airlines, the Canadian Transport Agency ruled late last year that ticketing rules that don't guarantee adjoining seats for parents and their children were neither unreasonable nor discriminatory. 

The problem may be a result of how passengers can select their seats. 

Some airlines charge a seat-selection fee on lower-fare tickets at the time of purchase — a practice ""typical of an industry where margins are thin"" and carriers are looking for extra revenue without raising ticket prices, the briefing note says. 

Some passengers may not pay the fee, instead hoping to pick their seats when they check in, putting them in competition with other passengers in the ""first-come, first-served"" race for seats, the note says. 

Air Canada, Porter, WestJet and Sunwing all said their existing policies have worked well to limit the number of times parents are seated separately from their children. 

Sunwing, for instance, holds back a ""certain number of seats"" so that minors can sit adjacent to their parents during flights. WestJet said 96 per cent of children under 12 booked on its flights end up sitting with their parents. 

If families are seated in different spots, the airlines said crew members look for open seats and ask other passengers to voluntarily relocate so that families can stay together on flights. 

""The airlines try to accommodate parents and children when embarking, but that entirely depends on other passengers' willingness to accommodate the parents and children,"" said John McKenna, president and CEO of the Air Transport Association of Canada, which represents many smaller carriers. 

""Not very many people are willing to give up either an aisle or window seat for a middle seat."" 

McKenna said there was a ""regulatory or legislative solution"" to the issue. Parents, he said, should either book as early as possible when there are more seats available on a flight, or pay a seat-selection fee.

2d9ed242-a8d5-41db-8618-b5fd9f445e47,"Baltimore officer warned Freddie Gray needed medical help, newspaper reports",News,Yahoo! Maktoob News,"By (Reuters) - A Baltimore police officer charged with manslaughter over the death of black man Freddie Gray told another officer the man in their custody appeared to need medical assistance but none was provided at the time, the Baltimore Sun reported on Saturday.

Six Baltimore police officers were charged in connection with the death of Gray in April from a spinal injury, which sparked protests and rioting in the city and fueled a debate on police treatment of minorities in the United States.

Gray, 25, was arrested for carrying a knife and was bundled into a transport van while in handcuffs and shackles and not secured with a seatbelt, officials said.

Prosecutors have said Officer William Porter, who is black and was charged with manslaughter, assault and reckless endangerment in May, was called by Officer Caesar Goodson Jr, the van's driver, to check on Gray's status.

Porter told investigators he informed Goodson, who is also black, the jail booking facility would not process Gray because he was in medical distress, according to an article posted on the Baltimore Sun's website that cited police findings.

The newspaper said it obtained Porter's account from an initial police review of Gray's fatal injury.

Porter also told investigators he wondered whether Gray truly needed medical assistance, even though he requested it, or was faking injury because he wanted to go to a hospital instead of jail, the newspaper reported. 

Prosecutors have said that, when Goodson and Porter were discussing taking Gray for medical care, a call came in requesting police support and Goodson drove off with Gray still unsecured in the vehicle.

When Goodson later arrived at a police station, Gray had stopped breathing and was taken to a hospital where he died a week later, prosecutors said.

Some of the officers' accounts initially given to investigators differ from each other, which helps explain why separate trials were ordered for them. That includes Porter, who is expected to testify against Goodson and Sergeant Alicia White, The Sun said.

Goodson is charged with second-degree murder and White faces the lesser charge of manslaughter.

In a statement to the newspaper from lawyers for all six officers, defense attorney Joseph Murtha characterized police disclosure of their clients' statements as ""unfair and unconstitutional.""

ef05a51a-b5bc-4685-9ef0-6f86bdaff47a,Jeremy Sisto and David Walton talk tennis and 'Break Point',News,Examiner.com,"Watching “ Break Point ” makes you realize there haven’t been many movies made about tennis in a long time. The most recent one which comes to mind is “ Wimbledon ” which starred Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst, and that came out in 2004. But now we have “Match Point” which stars Jeremy Sisto and David Walton as estranged brothers who reunite to take one last shot at the U.S. open. Despite their differences, they do manage to work together and rediscover their love for the game. 

Both Sisto and Walton were in Los Angeles, California recently for a roundtable interview where they talked extensively about “ Break Point ” and what went into its making. Sisto plays tennis here and there, but he does not consider himself to be all that good at it. I asked him if his view of tennis changed at all during the making of this movie. His answer gave real insight into the life of a tennis player. 
 
Jeremy Sisto: “Hmm, now that’s a good question. I learned a lot throughout it. There was a documentary we watched called ‘Journeyman.’ It was about this guy very much like Jimmy, a journeyman tennis player who never made too much but he was ranked. He would travel around the world on these tours and he would get drunk and have a good time. He was basically Jimmy. It wasn’t a well-made documentary; it was just basically just him and with the camera. But that was the first time I kind of realized what the life of a tennis player was. What I really learned is that it is a really lonely life especially if you’re a singles tennis player. That’s something you really don’t think about when you’re watching Wimbledon. You do notice how intensely alone they are out there, trying to fight back from 6-2 or whatever. But the doubles tennis world, which I didn’t know that much about, is still not the matches people always watch. There’s always a little clip that’s always, ‘This is what happened at the doubles game.’ But it’s a much easier ride and it’s a much more fun ride too. One of the Bryan brothers (identical twins who are considered the most successful tennis duo of all time) I believe was going to go do singles and the other guy was like ‘maybe we should do doubles together’ and he had to decide, and he made a decision to do doubles. Although perhaps the money isn’t quite as good, the life is just better.” 
 
As for Walton, best known for his role on the NBC series “About a Boy,” it turns out he is actually a high-level amateur tennis player with a USTA rating of 5.0 on a scale of 1.0 to 7.0. His being cast in “Break Point” must have been a major stroke of luck for the filmmakers as his knowledge of the game must have been invaluable to them. I asked him what he wanted this movie to show most about tennis. 
 
David Walton: “Oh that’s a good question. I think I just wanted it to look like we were people who could really qualify for the U.S. Open. I’m actually friends with Andy Roddick and he just watched it before his match in Atlanta with Marty Fish he was like, ‘I approve man, I approve. You’re pretty good.’ So that was a huge moment for me, best moment of my life.” 
 
“Break Point” may not break new ground in the sports movie genre, but it was made with a lot of heart and goodwill. All the performances shine brightly, and it reminds the audience of just how intense a tennis game can be. In a month overflowing with movies big and small, this is one worth checking out.

ab931ee8-550e-4884-9b58-ea7a3a5d3d5d,"GLOBAL ECONOMY-Deeper China downturn, weak Europe and U.S. dents global growth outlook",News,CNBC,"growth outlook@ (Adds U.S. PMI data) 

					 
* China factory activity sinks to 6-1/2-year low 

					 
* Weak Asian demand drags on euro zone private business 

					 
* U.S. factory activity growth at 2-year low 

					 
Sept 23 (Reuters) - The outlook for the global economy became bleaker on Wednesday as signs of a deeper manufacturing downturn in China emerged, coupled with slow growth in Europe and the United States. 

					 
""There is substantial concern at present that global demand weakness is dampening the economy in the industrial countries,"" said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank. 

					 
China's factory sector activity shrank at its fastest rate in more than 6 years in September, according to the monthly Caixin/Market survey, sending investors worried about sagging global growth scurrying out of risky assets. 

					 
The preliminary Caixin/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China fell to 47.0, the worst since March 2009, missing expectations for 47.5 and slipping from August's 47.3. Levels below 50 signify a contraction. 

					 
It was the seventh straight month of contraction for the Chinese manufacturing sector and the survey showed business conditions deteriorating almost across the board, as firms reduced output, prices and jobs at a faster pace as orders fell. 

					 
The data underline the malaise in the world's second largest economy and just how difficult it will be for policymakers to steer the economy out of the biggest downturn in decades. 

					 
Last month, Beijing devalued the currency to support exports and boost growth, currently at 7.0 percent according to official data. 

					 
But that move was seen by investors as official endorsement of a slowing economy. A global financial market rout, notably in Chinese stocks, followed and forced the central bank to cut interest rates again, the fifth time since November. 

					 
China is a major importer of raw materials, especially from Australia, South Africa and Canada, and an exporter of finished goods. The slowdown in China is denting demand in emerging market countries which are dependent on commodity exports in particular. 

					 
Last week, the global market volatility of the past month figured high on a list of reasons the Federal Reserve did not raise U.S. interest rates as many expected for the first time in almost a decade. 

					 
Overall in Asia, sentiment at the biggest companies tumbled at a record pace in the third quarter on worries about China and the risks it poses to global growth, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed. 

					 
There are signs dwindling demand from Asia, led by China, is starting to hurt businesses in the euro zone, according to PMI survey compiler Markit. 

					 
Private business growth in the currency bloc slowed this month as Asian demand weakened, leading to fewer new jobs and forcing factories to reduce output. 

					 
The Markit Composite Flash PMI for the bloc came in at 53.9 in September against predictions of 54.1, down from 54.3 last month. Markit said the PMIs point to third-quarter growth of 0.4 percent. 

					 
""It is hard to see euro zone growth really kicking on,"" said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight. 

					 
""There is the very real risk that slowing growth in emerging markets like China not only hits euro zone exports but also has a negative impact on business sentiment and leads to a scaling back of investment and employment plans."" 

					 
Business activity in Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, slowed slightly in September while activity rebounded in France as manufacturing output swung back to growth after two consecutive months of decline. 

					 
Growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector showed no month-over-month change during September, staying at August's sluggish pace which was the weakest in almost two years, according to Markit. 

					 
The preliminary U.S. Manufacturing PMI for September was 53, the same as August, which was its lowest since October 2013. 

					 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the September figure would be 53.0. 

					 
Job creation in the sector also slowed, with the index at 51.4, its weakest since July 2014, down from a final August reading of 52.4. 

					 
A strong dollar, flagging demand in many export markets and reduced capital spending by energy and other companies all dragged on U.S. manufacturing, according to Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.

Labor Day marked the final day that public pools were open in the city of Frederick, with the little swimmers escaping the sweltering summer heat one last time, while their parents watched and took in the rays. 
 
Both the Edward P. Thomas Jr. Memorial Pool in Baker Park, and the William R. Diggs Memorial Pool off Carroll Creek shut down after Labor Day. 
 
At the Diggs pool, Ann Truelove rested while her two daughters, Natalia, 3, and Tina, 7, swam around, Natalia scrambling around on a giant crocodile toy. 
 
Truelove said that the family had frequented the Diggs pool quite a bit over the summer — the pool caters not too much to the high schoolers, but rather to families in the downtown area, like hers. 
 
The girls climbed out of the swimming pool for just a moment during adult swim, sitting down to snack on Chobani yogurt. 
 
“It cools you off, and you get to see your friends,” Tina said of the pool, smiling shyly. 
 
On this particular Labor Day, temperatures reached the low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. 
 
No ice cream trips were planned after the pool date, Truelove said, as the girls had to return to school the next day. 
 
Across town, at the Baker Park pool, Anthony Compton sat with his 2-year-old granddaughter, Malya. 
 
Compton moved to Frederick several months ago, and said his family visits the municipal pool in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, but that Baker Park’s was much better — large and kid-friendly, he said. 
 
“She loves the water,” he said, pointing to Malya, who waded in, squealing as the water hit her “Little Mermaid” bathing suit. 
 
The lifeguard at Baker Park, Angel Baron, 16, said that she was glad the summer season was wrapping up — the pool isn’t a terrible summer job, she said, but she’s tired of picking up diapers left near the pool or restroom, she said with a laugh. 
 
“They’re definitely more rowdy on the last day,” she said, scanning the pool behind her sunglasses.

•	Security one of the main drivers for SMEs moving to the cloud 

•	UK and US have highest number of multiple cloud software users 

London, 15th Sept 2015 – The UK’s small-and-medium-sized enterprises are taking a global lead when it comes to embracing new software technology – but only when it is absolutely necessary to do so. These are some of the findings of a global research study commissioned by business software provider Exact that compares how SMEs in different countries stack up against each other when it comes to technology adoption. 

The ‘Exact 2015 SME Cloud Barometer’ – an independent research study of just under 3,000 SME leaders across the UK, the USA, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium – found those who are ‘heavy users’ of cloud software (defined as having three or more different cloud products in place) achieved far higher revenue growth and more than double the profit of those using fewer cloud products. 

The study found the UK has the second highest number of ‘heavy’ cloud software users (27%), just marginally behind the USA (29%). This compares to 25% of SMEs in the Netherlands, 24% in Belgium and France, and just 10% in Germany. Overall, just under half of UK SMEs (47%) are now using at least one cloud business software tool. 

Significantly, those who have embraced the cloud and are using multiple software products as part of their business processes showed on average 26% growth in revenue in 2015, compared to 14% among those using one or two online solutions, and 10% among those who don’t use any cloud solutions at all. 

Although the research shows the UK does have plenty to shout about when it comes to tech adoption rates among its five million+ SMEs, there are shortcomings when it comes to optimizing working practices. Only 10% “actively look for new solutions that help us grow” – the lowest number among any of the comparison countries – while the most popular reason given for implementing new software solutions was “when we need to replace outdated versions” (54% - higher than any other country). 

In terms of what is driving cloud adoption, IT cost savings is the primary reason for UK SMEs (32%) – unlike everywhere else where better security was the main reason for switching away from on-premise software solutions or traditional pen-and-paper style processes, particularly in Germany (36%). In all cases, easy access to information was cited as the third biggest benefit for moving business and finance processes online. 

When it comes to financial challenges and how technology can help address those, getting customers to pay on time is the top issue facing UK SMEs (40%), followed by cash flow management (33%). These concerns are clearly justified; according to the research, 11% of UK SME’s invoices are paid late, and 2% are never paid at all. UK manufacturers are particularly affected by late payments (16% are overdue), while wholesale & distribution businesses are most affected by invoices never being paid (5%). 

These financial concerns might explain why among those cloud adopters who took part in the poll, accounting software is the most popular business tool being used (27%). 

“Few business leaders would argue with the fact that having the right software tools in place can be vital to success,” said Erik van der Meijden, CEO of Exact. “In fact, 63% of the SMEs who took part said they felt that technology is going to have a strong impact on the competitive landscape in their market over the next three years.” 

Lucy Fox, General Manager, Cloud Solutions at Exact UK, added: “There is a real opportunity here for UK SMEs to build on the success and status they hold on the global stage. To do so, businesses need to ensure they stay competitive, efficient and provide the very best in customer service. Cloud adoption levels appear to be growing, and highlighting the tangible benefits it can offer through research like this will hopefully encourage more UK SMEs to follow suit.” 

The research found UK SMEs had the highest average net profit margins last year (2014) among all the comparison countries - an average of 20%, just ahead of those in the US (19%), but twice as much as those in France. That positivity looks set to continue with revenue growth figures for this year predicted to be 16% - nearly twice as much as expected by those in the Netherlands.

Additional findings 

•	The biggest reason given for SMEs globally to choose online software tools is that they offer better security (32%), followed by lower IT costs (25%) and easier remote access (23%). Among UK SMEs lower IT costs was the most important benefit (32%), followed by security (28%) and then easy access (25%).  For UK manufacturers the benefit of lower IT costs was particularly important (37%). 

•	Those SMEs in France, Germany, The Netherlands and Belgium that have moved business and finance processes to the cloud have seen a considerable decrease in the number of security incidents – particularly those in France who experienced a 20% fall. The number of security incidents experienced by those in the USA and the UK largely remained unchanged – UK SMEs as whole saw a 1% drop after the switch, although UK manufacturers reported a 10% drop. 

•	The biggest challenge financially for SMEs globally is getting customers to pay on time (32%), followed by managing cash flow (28%) and then, jointly, financial forecasting and keeping up with changing rules and regulations (both at 22%). Getting customers to pay on time is a particular issue for UK wholesale & distribution businesses (49%), manufacturers (43%) and professional services businesses (also 43%). 

•	French SMEs spend the most time on financial administration – averaging 9.3 hours per month, while German SMEs the least at 7.9 hours per month. UK SMEs have felt the greatest benefit of switching their finance management processes to the cloud – cutting the time spent on financial administration tasks down by 60% in doing so. 

•	UK wholesale & distribution SMEs have the worst record when it comes to proactively looking for new software solutions – 61% saying they only do so when they need to replace outdated existing versions (against a global average of 49% among all SMEs), while UK professional services businesses have the worst record for looking for new technology solutions that can help them grow - only 4% said they do so (against a global SME average of 14%).",1273,"• Global ‘barometer’ compares tech adoption rates of 3,000 business leaders • Security one of the main drivers for SMEs moving to the cloud • UK and US have highest number of multiple cloud software users London, 15th Sept 2015 – The UK’s small-and-medium-sized enterprises are taking a global lead when it comes to embracing new software technology – but only when it is absolutely necessary to do so.

Jen works with companies to help them make sure that they understand their customers better than any competitor or potential competitor. Her firm performs primary research for clients, using a variety of tools to gather information from customers, prospective customers, and the general market. Because of her considerable experience with a range of primary research tools I took this as an opportunity to explore the spectrum approaches that are available. 
 
This is my second interview with her, in June we talked about Win-Loss Interviews. You can download The Insight Advantage Research Tools Matrix , along with several other useful tools and articles, from the Resources section of The Insight Advantage website.   What follows is an edited transcript of remarks with hyperlinks added for clarity. 
 Primary Research Tools: A Spectrum of Choices  
Sean Murphy: Today, we wanted to give the audience an overview of primary research tools. At a high level, what are we are going to cover today? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I think what’ll be most helpful is to think of things on a spectrum from open-ended qualitative conversations (which we might need to define) and then the other end of the spectrum being where close-ended quantitative data is being gathered. So within that spectrum, we’ll talk about ethnographic studies on the far end of qualitative, then customer panels, usability testing, in-person interviews, focus groups, telephone interviews and telephone surveys, in-person surveys, then web surveys on the other end of the spectrum. 
    Qualitative 
Deep knowledge about fewer people 
Insights from below the surface

Sean Murphy: When you say an ethnographic study, that’s a technical term. What does that cover? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: This is a very specialized research. It’s really based on observing people in their natural environment to see how they act with product and services. For example, it could mean going to an electronics store and watching how people interact with displays and how much help they need to get questions answered about that product, or where their eyes go on a shelf…that’s part of an ethnographic study. It could also mean going to a home for a consumer-based product or an office for a business type of product or service and watching people actually in their environment using whatever the thing is. It’s funny because it really is quite insightful to see how people actually use a product versus how they say they use a product. When we’re asked to be analytical about how we use something, we might forget some details. Ethnographic studies help observe everything and people who do this are very expert at capturing every little new facet of a person’s interaction with a product. 
 
Sean Murphy: When the lean start up folks talk about getting out of the building or the lean quality folks talk about going to the scene of the crime, is this what they’re talking about? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes. I would say so. I think that’s one example, absolutely, of when you would want to gather information about how people are really using your product. 
 
Sean Murphy: What are the pluses and minuses of this approach? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: The pluses, I think, are that you get deeper understanding of things that people aren’t even aware of in their conscious mind about the way that they’re using products, the workarounds sometimes that they’re creating to overcome weaknesses in a product. You know how we are. We just accept certain things about products that we have worked around so we might not express that if somebody asked us. 
 
Sean Murphy: So you can spot things that are either below the consciousness because they don’t realize it yet or they’re so familiar with it they become acclimatized to it? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes. Let me give an example. I was a subject of an ethnographic study. Plantronics  wanted me to test out a new phone that I actually ended up buying. It was great. I love their phone. It was a digital phone, it had Bluetooth headset capability. When they were watching me using the phone that they had sent me to use, they realized that even though the headset was supposed to pair with my smartphone as well as their digital phone, I ended up wearing two different headphones, one on each ear (the one that came with the phone and my separate Bluetooth phone that I used with my smart phone). They really wanted to understand that. The problem was that pairing their headset with my smartphone was just too confusing. My phone, when it rang, never knew what to do and it just was a frustrating rocess. I had a workaround! They took pictures of me with my two headphones, one on each ear, but that was something that I may or may not have brought up because I had just accepted it. 
 
Sean Murphy: Interesting. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes. [Laughter] 
 
Sean Murphy: What made them decide to do an ethnographic model? When do companies choose ethnographic models? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I think it’s definitely in that early stage of a product, and it could also be a product that’s been around for a while but they’re developing the next model. In the early stage of the next ‘something’ when they’re really trying to understand whether there’s a need that they’re addressing. Because in some cases, an ethnographic study might be just studying people in an environment without a new product to play with and see what problems they’re running into. We call that the fuzzy front end when you’re trying to figure out where’s the need and then when we have a concept, is it hitting the need well or not. We didn’t talk about the cons. I got so interested in my two headsets. The cons of ethnographic study – sometimes it’s hard to get permission from people to participate in that way. I definitely thought twice before having somebody come into my home office and have somebody invade my space and watch me working… 
 
Sean Murphy: They actually came in to your office and sat and watched you. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: They did. That’s how it’s done. They don’t want you in an artificial environment. They want you in your native habitat. 
 
Sean Murphy: I see. So what about observer effects ? Do you think that can sometimes change behavior? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I think it could. I don’t think there’s any pure research unfortunately. I don’t know. There is always mystery shopping where people are watching and hiding behind the aisle or something, but I think that with most research, unfortunately, there’s the interference of knowing that you’re being studied, right? 
 
Sean Murphy: Right. So ethnographic studies are high cost but are potentially very high value, especially when you don’t have a lot of data about the actual use. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes and yes, it is very expensive because it’s one on one. It’s usually a couple of hours with a person and you have to travel to them so you’ve got travel time as well as the time with the “subject”. 
 Customer Panel  
Sean Murphy: In your introduction, the next thing that you talked about in terms of slightly less qualitative, slightly more quantitative were customer panels. How do you define a customer panel? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Customer panels, the way we’re talking about today, it would be when you have a static group of customers, key customers, that you want to have an ongoing relationship with and want to be able to tap them for their opinions throughout the life cycle of the time that they’re serving on the customer panel. A lot of people call these customer advisory groups or customer advisory boards. 
 
Sean Murphy: Yes, I’ve heard of those. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Some people look at it as a way to wine and dine their key customers, and that’s all fine and good. But unless you’re really tapping them for insight about the way their companies are experiencing your product or where their companies are going in terms of things that could drive future development, you’re not really getting the full bang for your buck. 
 
Sean Murphy: One advantage that this would offer over ethnographic is that they can tell you either behaviors they’re anticipating starting, or changes that they see coming. So it’s not just what’s going on now, but the customers may tell you what their plans are for the future. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Absolutely. Yes. The example I gave sounds like it’s only a B to B play, but but there are a lot of consumer product companies like Procter and Gamble that use customer panels. They have customer panel where they have moms using detergent and coming in and giving their input on new ideas and what’s changing about the way they look at these things. So it could either B to B or B to C. 
 
Sean Murphy: The key to this versus some other methods we’ll discuss is that this is designed to be an ongoing relationship. How long are people typically a member of the panel of the board? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: At least a year. Companies really want to have a long-term commitment for those kinds of things. 
 
Sean Murphy:  What prevents companies from taking this approach or what are the drawbacks for this approach? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Well, the downside is that it requires that long-term commitment from the customer. It’s a lot of time compared with whatever compensation there might be, and I think there’s also the fine art of figuring out how to incentivize people to participate without making them feel like they’re being bribed and you don’t want them being ‘yes people’. So I think that figuring out how to encourage a long-term commitment and how to provide enough benefit back to people to justify their time investment is definitely the most challenging thing. 
 
Sean Murphy: So one of the offers to the customers has to be “help us create the future.” Because they have to have some stake in your continued success. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: That’s true. It makes it sound like you only want raving fans to be on panel and you definitely want naysayers on your panel, too because those people are going to get you out of your comfort zone and get you thinking about things in a way that you might not have otherwise. As you can tell, establishing the balance of who’s on your panel is extremely challenging and it’s really important to making it work well. 
 
Sean Murphy:  We’ve helped startups do this a number of times. We’re focused on the front end of adoption so most of the time we’re looking for visionaries or pragmatists to help us complete the product. The technologists, for the most part, you reach by giving them hands on access to the offering… 
 Usability Testing  
Sean Murphy:  Which brings up usability testing. Could you talk a little bit about where this gets employed? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Sure. I think that’s something a lot of people have knowledge of or have participated in. Usually it’s around the technical product but not necessarily, and it’s an opportunity for companies to let actual users or potential users of a product play with it, try to break it. It’s funny because it’s overlaps a little bit with ethnography because you are observing people, but you’re taking people normally out of their normal habitat and you’re bringing them into a facility of some kind. Could be the company facilities themselves or could be a focus group facility. It’s a chance for people who designed the product to see how it actually works for people. 
 
Sean Murphy:  As I understand it, the focus is not on finding bugs but on finding problems where the user can’t figure out what to do or that there are unclear menus or instructions. What are the kinds of questions you try to answer in a usability test versus say an ethnographic study or a focus group? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Well, actually I think usability can identify bugs but you shouldn’t do usability test before you’ve done a lot of bug testing already. I think exactly what you’re saying around the actual user interface. Do people know how to navigate your solution, can they understand the instructions? For websites, there’s a huge field of experts around website usability. Understanding what content people are attracted to on your website, is that really where you wanted them to go, what’s the logical next step for them versus what you have intended. Those kinds of things all come out in usability testing. 
 
Sean Murphy: What are the drawbacks? When would you decide not to use this and to use something different? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: It takes time, definitely takes time, and it doesn’t necessarily help you figure out what the solution to the problem is. It just helps you identify the problem. But I would mention to say that almost all technology products that are out there these days are doing some kind of usability testing. They have to overcome the cost and the time obstacles of that type of research to make it fit in to product launch cycle. 
 
Sean Murphy:  I meet a number of folks who are usability or what they now call UX or user experience experts. How do you draw the line between retaining a usability consultant to give you advice and doing usability testing? Do you have any sense of how to split the budget or how to split the time allocation? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I think UX experts are great because they can help get you down the road in designing and functionality based on what they know from experience about what works, but I would never suggest that the company do just that. They have to get their products in the hands of people who would actually use it to see how they actually interface with technology…it’s changing all the time. What people expect on a webpage now versus even three years ago. It’s so different. So a UX person can only stay up with so much with that with things evolving and different generations using product. You need to get it in the users’ hands also. 
 In Person Interviews  
Sean Murphy:  After usability testing you list in-person interviews. Do you normally employ these techniques in sequence? Do you start with an ethnographic study and then establish a customer panel and then do usability testing? As you are planning for market introduction and product deployment are these tools used in a particular sequence? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: That’s a great question. I would say that companies use more qualitative approaches earlier in a product life cycle and they move to more quantitative because qualitative allows for the unknown, the things you don’t know to come up. But that doesn’t mean necessarily that every company will do an ethnographic study, will do customer panel, even unfortunately usability testing. But very few companies do them all. 
 
Sean Murphy: What are the typical triggers for deciding to do in-person interviews? When is that best used? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: It’s interesting. Sometimes when I work with a client, I find the same trigger for in-person interviews as what some companies or people would think were triggers for a focus group. It’s basically when you want input from your target market. You want to better understand things that aren’t so much about usability, but it’s around what triggers them to look for a product like yours, where will they look for it. You might even have people react to advertising copy or concepts for branding idea in in-person interviews. I guess I would like to talk about focus groups at the same time as interviews because all of those things apply to focus group talks also. 
 
Sean Murphy:  Is the in-person interview typically done in the person’s home or place of business, in a third party location, or at the client’s office? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Usually in a third party location. 
 
Sean Murphy: So a focus group will be many people in a third party location. In-person interview would be one on one in a third party location. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Typically, yes. The reason why I like to talk about both of these at the same time is because sometimes companies will say, “We need to know more about all of the things I just mentioned. We need to do focus group.” But often I push back and say, “If you’re trying to understand the buying process and how people think and how people evaluate your product, they’re not doing that in a group. They’re doing that in an isolated way and you really want to be able to drill down and explore that very deeply.” That’s where one-on-one interviews come in. You’re going to get a much more isolated view about how any one/person thinks than you will in focus groups. I think that focus groups are better when you could really use that group dynamic to generate ideas. When there’s something about the group that’s going to get you better data than if you have people individually and vice versa. I think that sometimes focus groups can impact people with the way they share their experience or their attitude, and it can taint the way that person shares their insight with you. It’s not really how they would act in their isolated ‘real world’, which is how they would normally buy that product. 
 Focus Group  
Sean Murphy: So do people typically do focus groups as a cost-saving measure or because the aspects of a group dynamic are helpful? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I think the companies think of them as a tool that will save money because you’ve got a lot of people in a room, but also it’s just popular. “Oh, focus group! Let’s do focus groups.” In-person interviews aren’t as sexy. Also, companies like the idea of sitting in the back room and watching people interact about their product and eating M&Ms and talking about the people in the room. It’s just this whole dynamic, but I often push back when focus groups come up as a methodology because more often than not, it’s the objective of the product doesn’t fit for the way I think focus group help the most. 
 
Sean Murphy:  When you talk about in-person interviews, is this for both customers and prospects or just one or the other? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson:  It works for both. One of the projects I’m thinking of where they wanted to do focus groups and I was the only vendor who said, “You really need to do one-on-one interviews.” We were talking to two different audiences. One would be a potential buyer of the product and the other would be a potential user of the product. This was an elderly device. So people like me who have an elderly mom would probably be the buyer and my mom would be the user, and so we did segmentation of the interviews based on who were we talking to. 
 
I used a focus group of customers when I was doing a naming project for company, a company that I worked for. I was the project manager for this re-branding. So we had focus groups of customers come in. We also did some non-customer ones, but we did both to get input on various brand names that we’re thinking going to. We were consolidating three companies and wanted to get feedback on a new umbrella name for all three. So we got input from both customers and non-customers. 
 Telephone Interview / Survey  
Sean Murphy: Interesting. I had always thought of focus groups just for prospects. As we move along the spectrum to more quantitative methods, next up is telephone interviews and telephone surveys. What is the distinction between a telephone interview and a telephone survey? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: It’s interesting. A telephone interview could just be a different way of doing the in-person interview that we just talked about. Telephone interviews could be trying to accomplish a lot of those same objectives that we talked about. Anything you wanted to talk to somebody about one on one, isolate their ideas, be able to drill down very deeply on their opinions, perspectives, insights, all of that. The only difference between telephone interview and in-person interview is you’re doing it remotely and you’re not face-to-face. A telephone survey is where, for whatever reason, you decide that administering a survey on a phone is preferable to what we’re more used to now like web-based survey. The reason somebody would do a telephone survey is that they want to collect the quantitative data, but they want to have just a little flexibility to stop and drill down further in certain areas. Maybe there are trigger areas that if they come up, you have to put the things you want to drill down more about, but you have that ability way more with the telephone survey than you would with the more traditional web survey. 
 
Sean Murphy:  Given a choice between an in-person interview and a telephone interview, when do you would pick telephone interview over an in-person? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Well, telephone interviews can go a long way. I think that it’s much easier to get geographical distribution and representation in a project doing telephone interview. It reduces the budget enormously, and also people are way more likely to participate in a phone interview than having to come somewhere and do travel time to go someplace. So the in-person interviews that I’ve done, we actually have a reason for doing it in person where we have to show them something. One project I’m thinking about was about digital photo frame concept. So it was a device. We really needed them to see it and we weren’t going to ship those out to people, right? I think there are less and less in-person interview now with travel being such a pain and other technologies helping bridge that distance. So telephone interviews would be the first line of attack if you’re trying to do a one-on-one interview. 
 
Sean Murphy:  We have used in-person interviews two ways. One where we go to their place of business because we get a chance to see the work environment and pick up the vibe. The other is at an industry conference or event that gathers people together, we can then use the event as an excuse to conduct a face to face interview where there’s no travel involved. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes. Absolutely. There was a project where the client was a global technology firm and they were looking at some new industries they wanted to get into. So let’s say one with petroleum and one with hospital. They wanted high-level executives in those industries to do one-on-one interviews. So we had to go out and find people all over the world that could speak the local language and go into the executive’s office and have an hour interview with them. It was a huge undertaking. It cost many, many, many tens of thousands of dollars. It took a really long time. The thought was that if you want that higher level person, the only way you’re going to get them is face-to-face. They don’t tend to get on the phone because it doesn’t seem worth their while. This was a really tough project to execute, and it’s very complicated when you’re trying to go into their space. Anytime you’re trying to get those higher-level folks, very, very challenging. 
 
Sean Murphy: One trick a client who sells a very high ticket product has used is to ask the executive the next time they’re flying and buy a seat next to them on the airplane. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: That’s great. [Laughter] 
 
Sean Murphy: Because it’s typically viewed as less productive time and you get whatever the flight length is–anywhere from an hour to two or three hours. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: That’s very creative. [Laughter] Those executives, they’re hard to pin down. 
 
Sean Murphy: Right. That’s why it’s easier to schedule telephones interviews–and I agree with you, I think you get about 80% of the value of face to face–because the person on the other side always knows they can hang up. It’s more uncomfortable to throw you out of their office… 
 Print Survey / Web Survey  
Sean Murphy:   So then when do people choose surveys? These are the most quantitative, the most numeric. When do you see these getting employed and what are they best for? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Realistically, companies are doing web surveys ALL of the time right now and they’re not necessarily thinking about where it’s the right tool. Web surveys are not the right tool for everything:  they’re good when you need a lot of data, where we are gathering thousands of responses to make statistically significant results pop out. 
 
But you have to know a lot about the market to write a good survey. Sometimes we will start with telephone interview so I can get clearer on the terminology, the mindset, the world that the customers live in so I can create a great web survey that resonates with them. One where I can create close-ended answered choices that represent at least 80% of the boxes that need to be checked. 
 
Unfortunately, if you do a web survey when you don’t know enough about your market, you have a lot of people checking that ‘other’ box and that really defeats the purpose of a web survey.  Done right you can quickly digest data, make calculations of frequencies of answers, and get good insights in close to real time. You can tap into web surveys while they’re still live and see the trends in the data. 
 
But you should only use a web survey when you have enough knowledge to write a good survey that really resonates to the people. 
 
Sean Murphy: Yes. I agree. I see people going the survey route first out of a false belief in higher productivity. We don’t use them that often. When  I do office hours I send a four-question follow up survey, but it’s four open-ended questions . It’s what was the most useful question, what was the least useful question, which is your plan to change result of the office hours, and what can we do to improve our process. Those are open-ended questions where I’ve found that that tends to give me the most insight. Most of the time, I’m working so far at the beginning where you just don’t know enough to do the closed-ended surveys. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: What you were describing, is that an evaluation like a post-engagement evaluation? 
 
Sean Murphy: Yes. That’s an evaluation, which is a form of research but it would be with people who are still prospects. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: There are so many different ways to gather data, right? I mean that is something we’re not even touching on is evaluation like post-training evaluation or post-service evaluation. I do a post project web survey with my client, and I would much rather do a debrief in-person with them about how did things go and that kind of thing. I just can’t pin them down. They’re on to the next thing,” and so I have a web survey that I send to them so that I can at least capture some metrics and it is confidential. I have to consolidate the data over the time, but evaluations are a whole other thing with their own challenges. 
 
Sean Murphy:  The other place I find a survey useful is for people that are more introverted and want to take some time to write an answer or want to have slept on it. The challenge with direct conversation is that it can make introverts more uncomfortable. We normally send the key questions in advance we are going to ask so that it feels less like a pop quiz. Even for extroverts it can help them to think about what are going to discuss in advance. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson:  We haven’t talked about things like online focus groups, online bulletin boards. Those are things that are more asynchronous where people participate over maybe a week. So it deals somewhat what you’re talking about. It takes a focus group concept and allows people to participate on their own time at their own pace and be able to come back and revise their answers and that kind of thing. So that is the beauty of an online tool like that. 
 
Sean Murphy:  That’s a very good point. I think an email discussion group or an online forum for customers has a different dynamic from a customer panel and allows allow you to assess the user community’s problems and needs more broadly. 
 When to Use Which Research Tool  
Sean Murphy:  As I look over the spectrum again, you’re guided by how much they know about the market and how mature the product is. When how have little market knowledge or the product is less mature, you’re encouraging your clients to look very hard at qualitative methods, ethnographic studies. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Absolutely. Yes. 
 
Sean Murphy:  When do you start to encourage them to transition to more numeric or more quantitative approaches? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: It’s so funny because this is the art of what we do, right? [Laughter] This is the art. 
 
Sean Murphy: Well, I think it’s actually a very hard question because it gets into  how to assess what you don’t know. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: I have a client, Plantronics. They wanted to make some decisions about whether to pursue a vertical market for one of their products. They needed to have huge numbers of participants to be able to size those markets properly. So when you’re talking about market sizing and comparing market segments, a web survey’s absolutely the right way to go because you need a significant amount of data to be able to feel confident about putting your eggs in any one bucket or segment. You can get away with more directional data in some of the other objectives that we’ve talked about where you’re trying to decide between this market message in this market and other market message. Well, you can change market messaging pretty easily. So directional data is okay in some cases and statistically significant hard result is more appropriate than others. 
 
Sean Murphy: Interesting. Are there other questions that I didn’t ask that you wish I had? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: That’s such a great researcher question. [Laughter] 
 
Sean Murphy: I think you taught that to me actually. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: [Laughter] That’s great. Gosh. I really feel like we’ve covered a lot of it. I think that some things for another day would be how online platforms are impacting research and when they’re appropriate. But that’s too much to go into that, touch on that. I think that the preachy thing that I love to share when we’re talking about research tools is that just because there are a lot of web survey tools out there doesn’t mean everybody should be doing web surveys and that it’s really important to step back and think about what are your objectives, where are you in your own process, and decide what the right tool is. I get concerned because it’s so easy for people to do their own research using all these amazing tools out there that there are too many situations where the wrong tool is being used just because it’s easy to pick up. 
 
Sean Murphy: Is there any particular downside to using the survey either prematurely or in the wrong way? How do you tell if you’re either too early to be using it or you’re not using it in the best way? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Well, I think that’s two different questions. All of these tools are about making decisions. I mean that’s really ultimately why you do research. You’re making some decision. But if you’re using the wrong tool and you’re getting the wrong data in the wrong way, then potentially you could make the wrong decision. The other thing you could do, and I think we’ve all seen this happen, is if you do poorly designed research, especially if it’s not blind meaning they know that it was your company that conducted the research, it doesn’t reflect well on your brand or your product when you come back and you want to market something. If you’ve gotten those surveys where there was no answer choice that covered you and it was an excruciatingly long 25-minute survey, it doesn’t make you feel good about the company that’s building that research. It can impact sentiment. 
 
Sean Murphy: The ones I hate promise they can be completed in three minutes but require you to answer every question–you hit next page and they send you back the last page with red all over questions you skipped. You get to the third page, realize that this “three minute survey” has dozens of questions, and find yourself exhausted. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: See. What you just said, it totally ratifies what I tell my clients. When people make up answers just to get through the survey, you have bad data. I very often tell my client, “You have to do several surveys vs. try to answer every question all in one long survey. You have to ask only 10 to 20 most important questions and then you’ll get good data.” If you go beyond the tolerance of the person taking the survey, they’re just going to click, just click, click. And you’re getting very bad data. 
 
Sean Murphy:  I have a technical question for you. What’s the rationale behind requiring an answer? 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Well, the rationale is that a company’s paying for the research, they may or may not be offering some incentives so they need people to complete the survey. They don’t want to build a survey and pay for participants and not get enough data to make decisions at the end. 
 
Sean Murphy:  If 90 out of 100 people who took the survey don’t answer questions 7, 14, and 19, that sounds like it’s actually data. 
 
Jen Berkley Jackson: Yes. That is true, but it’s a fine line because if you have optional for everything, unfortunately you’re going to have people skip through the whole survey and get to the end and leave their contact information for whatever drawing you’re having. Using skip logic strategically will help deal with this…to help ensure that people are only getting questions that actually pertain to them. 
 
I agree with you that that would be helpful data to have if a majority of people skip a certain question. For me, that’s the thing you should find out in survey testing. If there’s a question that people are skipping, it’s because they’re probably confused about it or have some strong aversions to it. For example, sensitive information, I always make those optional. Household income. If it’s not an optional question, we’ll always have a decline to state answer choice. Age, income, those kinds of things. Whenever it’s a sensitive thing, you always should make it optional but those are usually not the need of the survey, 
 
Sean Murphy: Well, I really want to thank you for taking me through this. I like the spectrum. I like the way you have it organized, and I really appreciate you taking the time with me to walk through it.

As Donald Trump's feud with Jeb Bush reached new levels this week, Trump said he would still back ""the Republican,"" if the general election matchup were the former Florida governor versus Hillary Clinton. 

""I'd go with the Republican,"" Trump answered Wednesday morning on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" refusing to name his foe for the Republican nomination when asked about the general election choice. 

""Hillary was absolutely a horrendous secretary of state, probably the worst ever. I would have to go really with the Republican,"" Trump said. 
 
The question came one day after Bush and Trump published competing attack videos slamming each other for -- among other things -- praising Clinton. 

Trump's video, posted to Instagram on Tuesday, features Bush presenting Clinton with the ""Liberty Medal"" in 2013, which Bush called a recognition of ""the commitment of someone who has devoted her life to public service."" 

Bush earlier Tuesday published a video online slamming Trump for his past liberal policy positions -- a video that also included clips of Trump praising Clinton as ""very talented"" and ""terrific"" as early as 2012 -- as Clinton wrapped up her tenure as secretary of state. 

The Bush campaign pressed further Wednesday, publishing an online quiz that contrasts Bush and Trump's past positions on issues that paints Bush as the conservative choice. 

Trump also had words Wednesday morning for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is surging in the polls to tie Trump in the latest survey out of the early state of Iowa and is now right behind Trump in national ones. 

Trump, who has said he would like to avoid attacking Carson, called him a ""good guy"" whom he likes ""a lot."" 

But Trump tied Carson's rise in Iowa to his ad spending in the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Carson flooded the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire with TV ads after the first GOP debate, ads that seem to have made their mark in Iowa. 

Nonetheless, Trump said Carson's surge to tie Trump in Iowa came ""a little bit surprisingly.""",339,"(CNN) - As Donald Trump's feud with Jeb Bush reached new levels this week, Trump said he would still back ""the Republican,"" if the general election matchup were the former Florida governor versus Hillary Clinton.

ca0d0ee5-d6c7-4e20-b79c-c0bab2a6a731,FIFA suspend Jerome Valcke pending investigation into ticket allegations,News,Leighton Buzzard Today,"FIFA has been thrown into fresh turmoil after secretary general Jerome Valcke, Sepp Blatter's right-hand man, was suspended by the organisation pending an investigation into allegations he was implicated in a World Cup tickets scheme. 
 
		 
Emails and documents seen by Press Association Sport suggest Valcke was aware that a Swiss marketing company was selling off World Cup and Confederation Cup tickets for almost five times their face value. 
  FIFA General Secretary Jerome Valcke has been suspended   
FIFA said in a statement: ""FIFA today announced that its secretary general Jerome Valcke has been put on leave and released from his duties effective immediately until further notice. Further, FIFA has been made aware of a series of allegations involving the secretary general and has requested a formal investigation by the FIFA Ethics Committee."" 

			 
The emails and documents show Valcke signed off contracts with Swiss firm JB Sports Marketing AG for category one tickets for a number of matches. 



 
In April 2013, JB's consultant Benny Alon said in an email to Valcke's personal email address that some tickets had been sold for up to five times the face value. But it was not until months later, in December of that year, that the contract was terminated. 

Alon claims he sent an email to Valcke in April 2013 detailing how much was being made on each ticket - the biggest mark-up being 50 tickets for a second-round match in Sao Paulo with a face value of 230 US dollars being sold for 1,300 US dollars each. 

Alon says in the email: ""we made US$114,000 each on Germany"". 

It is understood Valcke strenuously denies asking for or receiving any money for the deal with JB. It is also understood that Valcke insists FIFA terminated the agreement with JB once they realised Alon was selling tickets for the 2014 World Cup above face value. There is no explanation however at the delay in any action taking place. 

			 
Alon has claimed that his company sold the tickets on the open market not the black market, with transportation to the venue or a pre-match meal being used to justify the extra cost. 

That practice however clashed with FIFA's official hospitality partners MATCH and contravened Brazilian law, and Valcke told JB the contract had to be signed with MATCH instead. An email from Valcke warns that otherwise they may be committing a criminal offence. 

The email to Alon in December 2013 read: ""You, we, have no choice. Otherwise the deal will be canceled by Fifa or we all face as individuals criminal offense. It is not a joke. It is very serious. 

""So avoid too many advice. Just do it if I may say using a slogan from one company involved. All is clear and has to be finalized now. Thanks. Jérôme."" 

			 
Alon also told Press Association Sport he sold tickets to the 2010 World Cup final in Johannesburg - the higher price there being justified by having a golf match included as part of the deal. 

Valcke has been FIFA's secretary general, and outgoing president Sepp Blatter's right-hand man, since 2007. Before that he had a spell at FIFA's marketing director between 2003 and 2006, but left the organisation following a sponsorship negotiation with Visa and Mastercard that ended up in the US Courts - only to return to FIFA eight months later. 

He was also a central figure in the FIFA corruption scandal that erupted in May after Press Association Sport published a leaked letter to Valcke from the South African FA instructing him to pay 10million dollars originally destined for the World Cup organsing committee be transferred from a FIFA bank account to the now-disgraced Caribbean football chief Jack Warner. Chuck Blazer, at the time deputy to Warner, has testified to the US justice department the money was a bribe to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. 

A statement from Valcke's US-based lawyers said he denied all the accusations. 

The statement said: ""Jerome Valcke unequivocally denies the fabricated and outrageous accusations by Benny Alon of alleged wrongdoing in connection with the sale of World Cup tickets. 

			 
""Mr Valcke never received or agreed to accept any money or anything else of value from Mr Alon. As has been reported, FIFA entered into an agreement with Mr Alon's company, JB Sports Marketing. That agreement and FIFA's subsequent business dealings with Mr. Alon were vetted and approved by FIFA and its legal counsel."" 

Britain's former FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said it was important for the organisation to take action if any wrongdoing was proved. 

Boyce told Press Association Sport: ""Following the latest events regarding Jerome Valcke, I have consistently stated if allegations are made they should be fully investigated and if found there has been any form of corruption or dishonesty they should be dealt with in the strongest possible manner. 

""FIFA at the moment is at a cross-roads and it is more important than ever to re-establish their reputation throughout the world.""

I put about 4,000 miles a month on my car. It’s a 2012 model, and I currently owe more on it than it’s worth. I’ve considered selling it, but I’m concerned about reliability since I’m on the road so much. Do you have any advice? Chantel Dear Chantel, Rule of thumb number one when it comes to your finances is you don’t want too much of your financial picture tied up in things that are going down in value. Specifically, no one needs to have more than half of their annual income tied up in things that go down in value. You’re a road warrior, so whatever you drive you’re going to destroy. From a business perspective, you need a relatively low-mileage vehicle with good gas mileage that’s reliable and safe. You also want something that’s reasonably comfortable. Having said that, I would advise doing a lot of research and getting the least in car that meets all those criteria. Since whatever you drive is going to be worth nothing in about 20 minutes, I’d start setting aside some cash every month as part of a monthly budget for a newer, better car. That way, when it comes time to put the old one down, you’ll have a pile of cash to go along with your trade-in. But even in your situation, Chantel, I would never advise buying a brand-new car or leasing a vehicle. From a financial standpoint, either of those moves would be just about the dumbest things you could do! — Dave The buying decision Dear Dave, I live in Pennsylvania, and I’m accepting a new job out of state. My wife and I will be in this new area for at least two years, and we’re not sure if we should rent or buy a house. Ron Dear Ron, Most of the time, as long as you’re financially ready for such a big investment, buying a house is a good move. But if I’m in your situation, and I’m not sure if it’s a long-term thing, I’m going to rent until I see what the future holds. It seldom makes a lot of sense to live in a place for two or three years and sell it, unless you get a ridiculously good buy at purchase and are able to sell for retail without any trouble. Even though the economy is finally, slowly turning around somewhat, I’m not sure that most properties in the current marketplace would go up enough in value in only two years to offset your cost of sale.

Playing long-distance landlord is a pain in the rear! Rent for now, Ron.

It was a U.S. Open final no one expected and -- in the U.S. -- not many wanted but Flavia Pennetta could not care less. 

Pennetta beat pal and fellow Italian Roberta Vinci 7-6 (4) 6-2 in the title match in New York, a day after the runner-up engineered one of the biggest shocks in tennis history by ousting Serena Williams. 

Speaking of shocks, Pennetta then seemed to indicate in her on-court interview Saturday she was immediately retiring from tennis. 
 
Pennetta, who will turn 34 in February and almost quit the game because of a wrist injury years ago, became the oldest first-time grand slam champion in the Open Era. 

All of Italy rejoiced having two home-grown players in the final -- Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi even flew to the Big Apple for the unprecedented occasion -- but pockets of Arthur Ashe stadium, the largest regularly used stadium in tennis with a capacity of about 23,000, were empty. 

Had the U.S.'s Williams made the final, it certainly wouldn't have been the case. Chasing a calendar-year grand slam heading into the year's last major, the women's final at the U.S. Open sold out prior to the men's for the first time. 

U.S.A. Today reported that after Williams topped older sister Venus in the quarterfinals, the average ticket price soared from around $600 to $1,500. After Vinci stunned Williams on Friday, though, the Associated Press reported tickets could be purchased for $45. 

Besides the omission of 21-time grand slam winner Williams, the U.S. Open final featured two players ranked outside the top 20 for the first time since the rankings were introduced. They used to be, however, No. 1 players in doubles. 

Fans that did show up for the final, and they were plenty nonetheless -- including actors Robert Redford and Michael Douglas -- saw Pennetta handle the moment better. 

She was also able to handle Vinci's backhand slice, the most recognized part of the world No. 43's game. The slice, at times, befuddled Williams and helped to coax 40 unforced errors Friday. 

If it was Pennetta's last match, what a way to make an exit. 

On paper, Pennetta was the favorite. She was better ranked, at 26th, won one of the most prestigious tournaments outside the majors at Indian Wells last year, reached the top 10 in 2009 and held a 5-3 record versus the 32-year-old Vinci. She'll leave tennis as a top-10 player, too. 

And now she's Italy's second women's grand slam singles champ, following in the quick footsteps of Francesca Schiavone. 

Pennetta, a power baseliner with a penetrating backhand, seized the initiative by registering the first break for 3-2, capitalizing on her seventh break chance of the game. Through five games, Vinci didn't hit a winner and committed 10 unforced errors. 

Mostly untroubled in her service games, Pennetta blew a 40-15 advantage on serve and suddenly the score was level at 4-4. 

Onto a tiebreak they went, and Vinci cracked. From 2-2, she donated four unforced errors, including two on the forehand side. Pennetta sealed the 60-minute opener with a service winner. 

The winner of their three previous head-to-head tiebreaks won the match, and Pennetta, who downed grand slam winners or finalists Petra Kvitova, Sam Stosur and Simona Halep to get to the final, ensured a continuation. With all the momentum, she stormed to a 4-0 lead in the second. 

Pennetta fended off a fightback by holding for 5-2 thanks to a fine lob, prompting an emphatic fist pump in a match otherwise devoid of much outward emotion. She knew the job was almost done. 

It was official a game later. Pennetta broke to love, smacking an inside-out winner on match point, before flinging her racket in the air and exchanging a long hug with Vinci at the net. She later kissed her boyfriend, men's pro, Fabio Fognini. Waiting for the trophy presentation and in a rare occurrence among players, Pennetta and Vinci sat together. 

Sunday's men's final sees two familiar names play for the championship. Novak Djokovic, the world No. 1, faces Roger Federer for the second successive time to cap a grand slam. 

Djokovic, only the second man in the last 45 years after Federer to make all four grand slam finals in one season, won at Wimbledon and is seeking a 10th grand slam crown. 

The evergreen Federer, 34, tries for a men's record extending 18th and first since 2",745,"Defeats fellow Italian Roberta Vinci 7-6 (4) 6-2 (CNN) - It was a U.S. Open final no one expected and -- in the U.S. -- not many wanted but Flavia Pennetta could not care less.

ed72678f-c5f8-492f-ba5b-3da6136dd593,"In Texas, It May Have All Come Too Easily For Rick Perry",News,WCBE 90.5 FM,"The seeds of calamity for Rick Perry had been sown years before in the fertile political ground that Texas became for the Republican Party. 

Perry suspended his campaign for president Friday evening, becoming the first candidate this year to get out of the crowded race for president. It was his second failed bid for the White House after leaving as Texas' longest-serving governor. 

But his 14 years as governor, and the ease of his reelections in what became a heavily Republican state, may have been the worst thing that could have happened to Perry. He did not have to do the kind of work that could have better prepared him for the rigors of a presidential campaign. 

It didn't have to be this way. 

Almost immediately, his mouth began to get him in trouble  

Rick Perry looked straight out of central casting. If anything, he was getting better looking as he grew older. And he had a swashbuckling personality to match. When the longtime popular leader of the largest Republican state jumped into the presidential race four years ago, he shot to the top of the GOP polls. 

Even though he got in late in the game, in August 2011, Perry looked poised to topple Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who found himself down double digits to the man who appeared to be the polar opposite in so many ways. 

Everyone knew the Texas governor was a friend to business, and corporate America reciprocated his years of loyalty by opening wide its wallet. Not only was Rick Perry a contender, he was the clear front-runner! And with that, millions of dollars began pouring into Perry's campaign war chest. 

Presidential material meet Rick Perry. 

But almost immediately, his mouth began to get him in trouble. Trying to burnish his conservative bona fides in Iowa, the Texas governor ripped into Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Perry appeared to suggest that if Bernanke kept ""printing more money,"" he might meet with a violent response should he ever visit Texas. 

""I dunno what y'all would do to him here in Iowa,"" Perry grumbled, ""but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas."" 

Perry's veiled threat took veteran Texas political observers by surprise. Even Texas Republicans were mortified. If the Fed Chairman were ever to grace the gilded homes of the Dallas elite, he'd likely be served a big plate of BBQ, a Shiner Bock and perhaps a pointed discussion about the dangers of runaway inflation while he enjoyed his brisket. 

But be ugly or rude to him? That's not Texas. 

The governor wasn't off to a good start but that was OK, he'd catch his stride, Texans reassured each other. But he never really did. He came across as flat and uninspiring. At times, he would act a little goofy at the podium. After one particularly poor appearance in New Hampshire, the governor was forced to deny that he was drunk . Perry later admitted that he wasn't quite himself during the campaign because of complications from back surgery. 

His seeming lack of effort gave off a whiff of entitlement, almost as if he didn't realize he was going to have to work to win over Republican voters. They weren't automatically going to be in his corner. And then in the Republican presidential debate in November in Rochester, Michigan, came Perry's infamous ""Oops"" moment: 

It wasn't just that Perry forgot the name of the third federal agency he wanted to abolish if he were president, it was the long drawn out comedy that ensued as Mitt Romney and the debate moderator, CNBC's John Harwood, tried in vain to help the governor remember. 

It was a Saturday Night Live skit come to life, and it's unlikely George Washington himself could have survived it politically had he been in Perry's shoes. 

In that moment, Rick Perry's ambitions to be president of the United States were over. He just wouldn't know it for another four years. Republicans around the country had seen all they cared to and a pair of horn-rimmed glasses wasn't going to change that. 

Perry's Texas problem  

Perry began his career in the mid-1980s as a Democrat in the Texas House of Representatives. As the state began to move to the right, so did Perry, changing parties in 1989. He then rode atop a massive GOP wave, as it washed across the Lone Star State during the next decade. When Texas Gov. George W. Bush was elected President in 2000, Lt. Gov. Perry moved over into the still warm seat. And there he would stay for the next 14 years. 

As the years passed, and Texas grew ever more Republican, Perry put less and less effort into his reelection campaigns. There was no need, if you had an ""R"" beside your name in a statewide election you couldn't lose, which is true to this day. 

To the outrage of the Texas' newspaper editorial boards, he stopped giving them interviews; he didn't care who they endorsed and didn't mind if they knew it. Debates with his Democratic opponents were kept to the barest minimum. There was plenty of money to buy the best political advertising talent in the business and let them do their thing. 

But by taking the easiest path to reelection time after time, Perry was depriving himself the skills he would need to run for president. When he avoided the editors at the Dallas Morning News and Austin American Statesman, the governor wasn't fielding tough questions from knowledgeable sources. He didn't develop a broad catalogue of go-to answers for tricky ""gotcha"" questions or learn how to deftly pivot when presented with a topic that wasn't his strongest. He didn't perfect his debate skills by sparing with his political opponents on television repeatedly. 

Rick Perry didn't have to work out and develop his political muscles to win in Texas — so he didn't. It was a pleasure to rub Texas Democrats noses in the reality that they were so hopeless he barely had to try. But as every high school football coach in Texas will tell you, it's not always the most talented team that wins, but sometimes the squad that's put in the hardest work. 

And while it may be true that Perry was never going be the next Republican Barack Obama on the campaign trail, turning undecided voters into starry-eyed supporters, there was no reason for him to be as surprisingly hapless as he proved to be.",1078,"The seeds of calamity for Rick Perry had been sown years before in the fertile political ground that Texas became for the Republican Party.

d2337fea-7c3d-48ec-8e09-ef1cdcb3072a,ACCC holds up Foxtel's Ten bid over sport,News,Yahoo! 7 Finance,"The competition watchdog has held up Foxtel's bid for a 15 per cent stake in Network Ten over concerns that the pay-TV giant is trying to get around Australia's anti-siphoning rules to show more sport. 

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is worried that future joint bids from Foxtel and Ten could represent a way around the rule that pay-TV operators cannot bid for listed sports before free-to-air broadcasters have had a chance to buy them. 

The ACCC says the proposed $77 million deal could increase the amount of sport shown exclusively on Foxtel, and is worried the extra financial muscle could give Ten a big advantage over its free-to-air rivals when it comes to securing sport broadcast rights. 

The watchdog has asked for more information on, and reaction to, the acquisition, which rival broadcasters oppose. 

""The allegation they're making is that Foxtel will be able to get hold of a lot more sport than they're currently allowed under the anti-siphoning rule,"" ACCC chairman Rod Sims told AAP. 

""Is this about Channel Ten becoming the dominant player in the free-to-air market, or is it about Foxtel, and to some extent Ten, dominating the television viewing market?"" 

The ACCC has set a September 28 deadline for submissions and will announce a final decision on October 22. 

Ten has rejected the concerns. 

""Ten firmly considers that the objective evidence establishes that the proposed transactions will increase competition in the relevant markets,"" the network said on Monday. 

Mr Sims said the ACCC understood Ten's position but that it wanted to sit down with both merger parties and any rivals opposed to the move to ""thoroughly test"" the broadcaster's logic. 

""What they're talking about is that Ten is the No.3 TV station and anything that boosts Ten will help them be more competitive against Seven and Nine,"" Mr Sims said. 

""We take a different tack."" 

Foxtel, which is joint owned by Telstra and News Corp Australia, wants to take up 50 per cent of a $154 million capital raising by Ten. 

Ten has suffered years of declining advertising revenue, despite funding injections from heavyweight shareholders including Gina Rinehart, James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch, and the ACCC is concerned that the deal would further decrease competition on that front. 

As part of the deal, Ten would take a 24.99 per cent stake in Foxtel's advertising business, Multi Channel Network, which would also become a sales representative for the free-to-air broadcaster. 

Ten would also have an option to become a 10 per cent shareholder in Foxtel's online streaming venture Presto within two years, but that is not an issue for the ACCC.",436,"The competition watchdog has held up Foxtel's bid for a 15 per cent stake in Network Ten over concerns that the pay-TV giant is trying to get around Australia's anti-siphoning rules to show more sport.

7:10 p.m. 

North Korea is using a United Nations summit on development goals to accuse the United States of trying to ""suffocate"" it through sanctions. 

The sanctions imposed by Washington are in retaliation for Pyongyang's refusal to mothball its nuclear weapons program. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong said the U.S. measures are a result of America's ""inveterate animosity and hostile policy"" aimed at toppling the communist system. 

The summit is focused on working toward eradicating extreme poverty, alleviating hunger and improving access to health care by 2030.

5:45 p.m. 

Britain's prime minister says fighting poverty must include ending gender inequality and freeing international trade from ""unfair barriers."" 

David Cameron also urged establishing global policies on taxation and transparency as a way of improving the lives of the world's poorest. 

Cameron spoke at a U.N. summit of global leaders discussing ways to implement wide-ranging development targets over the next 15 years. They include wiping out extreme poverty through a combination of active programs and annual contributions of $100 billion to the world's underdeveloped nations.

Ghana's president is putting the fight against global warming into terms that make sense to just about anyone. 

President John Dramani Mahama says that if our definition of ""developed"" is shopping malls, glitzy neon lights and KFC, ""then we will need two more planets, the size of our earth, to maintain and sustain the human race."" 

He spoke to a U.N. summit of world leaders on an ambitious new set of 15-year development goals, and he pointed out Africa's critical role. 

Mahama says that if the world wants the tide of young Africans seeking work in Europe to stay at home, it will have to relocate more industry and production to the African continent. 

He says Africa can be more than a producer of basic goods that others refine.

4:35 p.m. 

France's president says he's earmarking an additional $4 billion annually for development programs aimed at fighting climate change and other global goals agreed to at a U.N. summit this week. 

Noting that France is hosting a global summit on combating climate change later this year, Francois Hollande said France ""wants to set an example"" and that as host of the climate summit Nov. 30-Dec. 11 in Paris. 

France will ""call for behavior that needs to be exemplary,"" he said. The additional aid will be accompanied by the creation of a new development bank that he said would be Europe's largest. 

Leaders gathered at the U.N.'s global development goals summit pledged to work toward eradicating extreme poverty, alleviating hunger and improving access to health care by 2030, and to fulfill an earlier pledge by developed countries to contribute $100 billion annually to the world's poor and developing countries.

Francois Hollande told reporters after a lunch with about 30 other leaders gathered at the U.N. that 81 countries have so far submitted national commitments toward fighting climate change, and he called on others to have their plans ready well before the Nov. 30-Dec.11 conference. 

Hollande said ""there is work to do"" to match leaders' desires for a deal in Paris with the conditions need to make it ""credible and capable of settling questions about warming for decades to come."" 

Also Sunday, Britain pledged $8.8 billion (5.8 billion pounds) in climate finance from 2016 to 2021, a 50 percent increase in spending for climate change-related projects. 

Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said the contribution was compatible with Britain's ""fair share"" of plans by developed countries to jointly mobilize $100 billion of climate finance annually by 2020. 

On Friday China announced it would provide $3.1 billion to help vulnerable countries tackle climate change while the Asian Development Bank said it would double its annual climate finance to $6 billion by 2020.

President Barack Obama has committed the U.S. to a new blueprint to eliminate poverty and hunger around the world. 

The plan is being discussed at a global summit at the United Nations, ahead of a meeting of U.N. General Assembly session. 

Obama told delegates that 800 million men, women and children scrape by on less than $1.25 a day and that billions of people are at risk of dying from preventable diseases. And, he called it a ""moral outrage"" that many children are just one mosquito bite away from death. 

Obama says the goals of the 15-year plan are ambitious, but he says they can be achieved if governments work together. 

He adds that recent progress, from declining hunger rates to more children enrolled in school, ""gives us hope.""

China's glamorous first lady Peng Liyuan is maintaining her high profile at the United Nations, presiding at an event commemorating the U.N.'s 2030 development goals for people with disabilities. 

The former folk singer has taken on a public profile that is unique among the wives of recent leaders of the People's Republic. At Sunday's event, she listened to a blind children's a cappella choir, unveiled commemorative stamps and delivered a speech in English. 

""Madam Peng was moved to tears,"" said Zhang Haidi, chairwoman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation who attended the event. 

Peng is a World Health Organization goodwill ambassador for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and on Saturday spoke at an event promoting the health of women, children and adolescents. The same day, she attended a separate event in her other role as UNESCO special envoy for girls' and women's education. 

""We're so glad to have a wonderful first lady. As an artist, she has a real passion for people,"" Zhang said.

Saudi Arabia is protesting any references to homosexuality in a sweeping new agenda for global development, saying it runs ""counter to Islamic law."" 

Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir told a U.N. summit of world leaders Sunday that ""mentioning sex in the text, to us, means exactly male and female. Mentioning family means consisting of a married man and woman."" 

He asserted his country's right to not follow any rules that relate to any ""deviations"" from that belief as the world moves forward on the new development agenda. 

The so-called Sustainable Development Goals include a target to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights by 2030. Some states like Saudi Arabia and the Vatican are concerned that references to ""sexual rights"" include rights for gay people.

Greece's prime minister has declared that the world can't talk about global development without addressing debt restructuring. 

The newly re-elected Alexis Tsipras addressed a U.N. summit on sweeping new development goals over the next 15 years. 

The goals aim to eliminate poverty, but Tsipras says the world can't tackle that ""unless we can discuss how to build or improve welfare states instead of destroying them."" 

Greece has depended on bailout loans from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund since 2010. 

Tsipras told the U.N. gathering that the Eurozone economic crisis cut his country's GDP by 25 percent. He called debt a challenge ""at the center of our global financial system."" 

Tsipras pledged Friday to fast-track negotiations with international bailout creditors so Greece can get some much-needed debt relief.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is urging the United States to lift its embargo on Cuba and to end other sanctions which ""bypassed the UN Security Council."" 

The United States and Europe Union have imposed targeted sanctions on Russia for its take-over of Crimea and backing for rebel forces in eastern Ukraine. 

He decried such coercive measures imposed in what he said were in violation of the U.N. Charter, saying they contradict new global development goals and undermine market principles in trade, finance and technology. 

Commenting on a newly adopted program for combating global poverty, Lavrov reaffirmed Russia's commitment to supporting the global agenda ""despite the challenging economic environment."" 

The foreign minister said Russia was a global leader in the cumulative reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions. He said Moscow has over-fulfilled its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by reducing emissions by 31 percent below 1990 levels.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is equating advances in women's rights to development in all sectors of society and is urging all nations to translate lip service into action in granting women full rights. 

Merkel spoke Sunday at a side event to the United Nations Summit that focused on women's rights. She invoked a U.N. Security Council resolution passed 15 years ago focused on women's rights and prevention of gender-based violence, in saying more must be done to protect women and promote their status. 

Declaring that ""women's rights are also human rights,"" she cited the fates of women exposed to violence in Syria, Iraq and other crisis regions. And she called for more concrete action to reach the goals of full elimination of inequality between the sexes, saying ""Signals are good, actions are better.""

Ukraine's president says the fighting in the eastern part of his country against pro-Russia separatists costs about $5 million a day that Ukraine could be putting into development. 

Petro Poroshenko spoke to a U.N. summit Sunday, a day before Russian President Vladimir Putin was expected to make his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly in a decade. 

Putin wants to talk about fighting extremists in the Mideast during his visit. Ukraine and its allies, including the United States, want to talk about the Russian-backed moves in eastern Ukraine that Poroshenko says ""has led to the emergence to a new form of poverty, sudden or unexpected poverty"" for thousands of people. 

Poroshenko says the fighting that began in early 2014 has made Ukraine lose ""about one fifth of its economic potential.""

The Belarus president is warning of another world war ""if we make one more step toward global conflict,"" and the ally of Russia made a not-so-veiled attack on Western efforts to address the conflict in Syria. 

""Why are you throwing a president out of office? How does this concern you?"" Alexander Lukashenko asked during his speech to a U.N. summit on global development that has drawn a record number of world leaders. ""What do you want? What are you striving for?"" He was speaking of Western demands that Syrian President Bashar Assad step down. 

He lamented the ""balance of power lost with the disintegration of the Soviet Union,"" of which his country was a member. 

Lukashenko wasn't the only critic of the United States to take aim. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's speech railed against ""one hegemon trying to impose its view on the world.'

China's President Xi Jinping has announced a $10 million donation to the U.N. agency promoting women's rights to implement the 1995 blueprint adopted by world leaders to achieve gender equality — which remains a new U.N. goal for 2030. 

Xi, who is co-chairing a meeting to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the U.N. women's conference in Beijing that adopted the blueprint, also announced that in the next five years China will help developing countries establish 100 ""health projects"" for women and children. 

He said China will also finance 100 projects to send poor girls to school, train 30,000 women from developing countries in China, and provide training opportunities for 100,000 women in other developing countries. 

Xi did not mention criticism of China's arrest of women's rights activists.

The French president has jolted the final day of a major U.N. summit to life by announcing his country's first airstrikes in Syria. 

Francois Hollande spoke at a hastily arranged statement to reporters a few minutes before the beginning of a day of speeches by President Barack Obama and many others. 

Hollande didn't take questions Sunday morning after giving details about the strike on an Islamic State group training camp. 

But when asked afterward whether this was the beginning of the end of the war in Syria, the French president smiled but said nothing.

ab422c40-04c2-45e8-80a8-8303f1b8c86d,Have we reached college football free agency?,News,ABC News,"Over a period of four days, two of the inaugural College Football Playoff teams replaced their Heisman-Trophy-winning quarterbacks with graduate transfers, fifth-year players who set foot on campus with their eligibility unencumbered by a redshirt year. 
 
Oregon named Vernon Adams Jr. , the Walter Payton Award runner-up the last two seasons at FCS Eastern Washington, to replace Marcus Mariota. Everett Golson , who started for Notre Dame in the BCS National Championship three seasons ago, will step into Jameis Winston's spot in the Seminole huddle. There is also  Greyson Lambert , who won the starting quarterback job at Georgia after starting nine games for Virginia a year ago. 
 
 
Watt headlines #NFLRANK: Top 100 players Gonzalez the hero for the Dodgers in the 14th Judge Berman announces no settlement in Brady's appeal Everett Golson named FSU starting QB sc  
 
 
Heavens to Russell Wilson , have we arrived at free agency? 
 
We live in an era when a football scholarship includes a stipend, when the amount of food provided a player is no longer legislated, when medical care has become a recruiting issue. The right of a graduate to transfer without redshirting is one more weight that shifts the balance of power between player and school toward the former. 
 
How permanent that shift will be is a matter of debate within the NCAA. Coaching traditionalists don't like the idea of free agency. Academic traditionalists believe the low percentage of football graduate transfers who complete a graduate degree -- 24 percent in the latest two-year study -- mocks the academic-athletic model on which the entire NCAA is based. 
 
And then there are the coaches who believe the four-year guaranteed scholarship is what it says -- a guarantee that stops at four years or when the player graduates. 
 
 
 
""Why should I, for just my own selfish purposes, be able to stop a guy who's gotten his college degree from playing someplace else?"" asked Stanford head coach David Shaw. Since the end of last season, the Cardinal has said goodbye to five fifth-year graduate transfers and hello to one. 
 
Shaw is aware of the arguments for keeping the veteran. A staff invested four years of coaching in them. Seniors are usually better in the locker room than freshmen. If he's sitting on your bench, he can't go somewhere else and help someone beat you. Shaw dismissed them all. 
 
""I would say coaches are second only to politicians as far as what they try to accomplish and what they believe in is very self-serving,"" he said. ""Right? I mean, nobody wants to give anybody any break anyplace else."" 
 
Nearly to a man, transfers want to play someplace else because it offers a better opportunity than what they would have if they stayed. None of the five fifth-year transfers Stanford lost were starters. Golson and Lambert were both starters who lost their jobs in spring practice. 
 
They are the typical transfers, not guys like Wilson, the NFL star who left North Carolina State five years ago with his degree in order to lead Wisconsin to the Rose Bowl. He may be the most prominent player to become a graduate transfer, but he wasn't the first. 
 
The NCAA passed the graduate transfer rule in April 2006, a time of glasnost for student-athletes' rights. The rule passed with no restrictions. You graduate, you have eligibility, you can go. The owner of the undergraduate degree had, according to the rationale presented in the rule proposal, ""earned the freedom"" to go elsewhere. 
 
Glasnost, indeed -- the rule seemed completely out of character for an NCAA known for its rigidity. 
 
""It was just totally off the grid for any of us who have been around the business for a while,"" said Marshall defensive coordinator Chuck Heater. 
 
Nine years ago, Heater was the coach of a Florida secondary that badly needed help. Suddenly, that help arrived. Corner Ryan Smith had quit the Utah football team that spring after a falling out with the coaches. He jammed 21 credit hours into summer school and transferred to Florida to play for Urban Meyer, the head coach who had recruited him to the Utes. Smith won the starting job, became an All-SEC defensive back, and won a BCS ring. 
 
""We wouldn't have won the national championship without him,"" Heater said. ""He just kind of dropped out of the sky."" 
 
The parachutes furled quickly. Two days before Smith and the Gators defeated Ohio State, 41-14, to win the BCS National Championship, the NCAA members voted to rescind the rule. The advocates didn't give up. Later that year, the NCAA adopted the rule that remains in effect: A player who earns his degree could transfer with permission of his alma mater if he had been accepted into the graduate school in an academic discipline not offered by the former school. 
 
 
 
The latter, in practicality, is an academic fig leaf. Transfer candidates figure out where they can fit in on a program's depth chart before they look across campus to the grad schools. 
 
""It seems that the rule is you have the ultimate flexibility to do whatever you want,"" Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly said. ""But it seems as though there's no academic component with it at all, and we're still colleges and universities."" 
 
Keep in mind that a decade ago, the NCAA wanted to increase graduation rates. Today's freshmen football players arrive on campus in June instead of August. And they don't go home very often. They take summer-school classes every year, attending school three semesters a year instead of two. 
 
No one considered the fallout of such a policy -- if the academic clock speeds up while the eligibility clock ticks at the same pace, the result will be graduates who still have a season (or two) to play. 
 
""It has created an interesting issue, hasn't it?"" mused Kevin Lennon, the NCAA vice-president of academic and membership affairs. 
 
The NCAA Division I Council appointed a committee of coaches and administrators to look at the rule last spring. The group recommended that graduate transfers should have to redshirt, but should be allowed a sixth year of eligibility. That would give them time to compete at their new program and, more important, get that master's degree. The Council couldn't table that recommendation fast enough. Restricting a student-athlete's flexibility would sound a politically tone-deaf note these days. 
 
""The data shows that folks aren't getting their (graduate) degrees,"" Gill said. ""...I think the issues are easy to see. I think the best solutions are hard to identify."" 
 
The philosophical question comes down to this: Should the NCAA emphasize the completion of a graduate degree with the same fervor that it promotes undergraduate degrees? 
 
There is, as always in the NCAA, the fear of the other guy. Taken to an extreme -- and what recruiter fails to stretch any NCAA rule to its elastic limit? -- will this sort of ""free agency"" promote roster poaching? Gill's committee asked the NCAA Committee on Infractions to weigh in on how severe an infraction that should be. 
 
And there is practical effect of the graduate transfer rule, which has been in effect for nine years. It allows the student-athlete to extend his career. 
 
""A guy has five years to play,"" Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher said recently on the ESPN Championship Drive podcast. ""This may be the last time he ever plays. ...(To) go and fulfill your dreams of being able to play college football at a different level, have a different opportunity, plus, you've already graduated, I don't see the problem in it."" 
 
A year ago, Fisher lost Jake Coker , a backup looking for an opportunity, to Alabama . This year, he will start Golson, a backup looking for an opportunity. The graduate transfer rule may be free agency. Then again, it just may be college football's version of a rummage sale.

51e02163-cf48-466d-a850-3a701e9e9139,SmithBucklin Releases Study on How Associations Are Leveraging Outsourcing Business Wire,News,Yahoo! Finance,"CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- 

A survey of senior U.S. association executives found that 81 percent of       associations are outsourcing functions other than audit and legal       services (which are by their nature commonly outsourced by       associations). SmithBucklin ,       the association management and services company more organizations turn       to than any other, today released the survey results as a resource for       association executives considering outsourcing as an option to help       achieve their organizations’ goals. 

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150909005466/en/ 
 
Graphic design/multimedia/video were the most outsourced service       functions, and editorial/publishing and advertising sales were tied for       second place. Those were followed by membership technology, tradeshow       management, exhibit/sponsorship sales and advocacy/government relations.       Furthermore, the survey showed that 46 percent of respondents said they       are considering outsourcing at least one function besides legal and       audit services. 
 
 SmithBucklin       Outsourced Services commissioned the survey to determine association       executives’ decisions and attitudes toward using services companies or       non-employees. Independent market research company Ipsos conducted the       survey of 360 U.S. association and professional society executives       (manager to C-Suite). 
 
“We were surprised by the fact that so many associations are already       using expertise outside of their organization,” said Leslie Thornton,       Vice President, SmithBucklin Outsourced Services. 
 
“The study shows how association executives are augmenting their       in-house teams,” said Carol McGury, Executive Vice President, Event and       Education Services, SmithBucklin. “Association executives realize they       cannot hire and employ every talent they need to deliver against the       important work of their organization. By outsourcing solutions for       specific needs, they can ensure that their organizations thrive while       serving the best interests of their members.” 
 
In addition to revealing what services associations are currently       outsourcing and the services they are considering outsourcing, the study       also showed how the organizations use or plan to use outsourcing to       achieve their goals, and what benefits they expect to gain by       outsourcing in the next two years. 
 
 What Associations Are Outsourcing  
 
Fifty-two percent of respondents said they outsourced graphic       design/multimedia/video. Other top outsourced services in order of       ranking included: editorial/publishing (27 percent), advertising sales       (27 percent), membership technology (26 percent), tradeshow management       (19 percent), exhibit/sponsorship sales (18 percent),       advocacy/government relations (18 percent) and marketing/public       relations (17 percent). Social media was last (7 percent). 
 
 Outsourced Services Associations Are Considering  
 
When asked what services they were considering outsourcing in the       future, 12 percent of respondents listed membership technology, followed       closely by event strategy/management (11 percent). Marketing/public       relations and graphic design/multimedia/video tied at 10 percent, and       education program development and social media tied at 9 percent. 
 
“In key areas, we outsource where it is difficult to have in-house       expertise,” one respondent said. “In areas where the business is       changing rapidly, like technology support, it makes more sense to       outsource.” 
 
“Seeing technology first on the list won’t surprise many people,”       Thornton said. “Today, many associations’ technology needs are more       sophisticated. In the era of big data and member analytics, associations       naturally will tap outside sources with proven expertise in collecting,       organizing and protecting membership data.” 
 
“It’s a similar case for event strategy and management. Association       managers are recognizing the need to bring new, innovative ideas to       their meeting space to help increase attendance, attract sponsors, and       drive attendee and member engagement both at the event and year-round,”       Thornton said. 
 
 Why Associations Use Outsourcing  
 
When asked to explain in their own words how they used or planned to use       outsourcing to achieve their organizations’ goals, most respondents       focused on outsourcing specific skills (53 percent), followed by       supplementing in-house staff (34 percent) and saving money (27 percent). 
 
Respondents also said they used outsourcing as a solution for temporary       staffing challenges (9 percent). Others responded that outsourcing       helped fulfill functions outside of the organization’s core purpose (6       percent), or meet goals and objectives (4 percent). 
 
Below are several examples of respondents’ comments: 
 
“Outsourcing enables us to have a high level of expertise in an area at       a much lower cost than if we had that employee on staff full time.” 
 
“Outsourcing allows us to utilize professional services on an ‘as-needed       basis,’ and the group we use can be fully focused on the task.” 
 
“We outsource when staff resources are at capacity. Usually we have a       mix of internal and outsourced activities going on.” 
 
 Outsourcing over the Next Two Years  
 
When association executives who are currently or considering outsourcing       were asked what benefits they expected to achieve with outsourcing over       the next two years, 70 percent cited accessing specialized talent. Other       answers included: increasing organizational capacity (58 percent),       increasing staffing flexibility (54 percent) and improving       organizational performance (53 percent). Almost half foresaw benefits to       their bottom line through reducing costs (48 percent), growing revenue       (31 percent) and increasing competitive edge (25 percent). 
 
“The association sector recognizes that outsourcing is an effective way       for organizations to extend their teams and wisely allocate resources,”       said Matt Sanderson, Executive Vice President, SmithBucklin. “In that       way, associations mirror the overall business sector, which continues to       rely on outsourced services as a time-tested business strategy.” A 2014       KPMG survey found that 72 percent of major enterprises were planning       to make increased expenditures in outsourcing services over the next two       years. 
 
In 2014, SmithBucklin launched Outsourced       Services in response to associations looking for specialized talent       and skills, increased staffing and organizational capacity, staffing       flexibility and new capabilities. SmithBucklin offers a comprehensive       array of high-impact, customized and cost-effective solutions in the       following areas: event and tradeshow strategy and management; exhibit,       sponsorship and advertising sales; financial management and accounting;       marketing and public relations; editorial and publishing; graphic       design, multimedia and video; social media; technology solutions;       education program development and management; government relations and       advocacy; promotional products and apparel; expert consulting and       leading practices; and worldwide capabilities.

Ipsos, the world’s third-largest opinion and market research company,       conducted the survey of 360 association and professional society       executives. In order to qualify for the survey, respondents had to be       high-level employees (manager to C-Suite) in the U.S. All interviews       were conducted between April 21 and May 18 through online data       collection.

Social Media: 

You’ve heard the expression “Cafeteria Catholic” to describe someone who picks and chooses the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church they want to believe in or adhere to. 

Me? I’m a Drive-Thru Catholic. 

Here are my (lapsed) credentials: Attended and graduated Catholic elementary school and a Catholic all-boys high school; altar boy for five years; and briefly flirted with the priesthood. 

Somewhere around my senior year of high school was the first parting of ways I had with the Church. 

That schism did not happen because of Church doctrines on issues such as abortion, divorce, women being excluded from the priesthood, etc. 

I think it grew out of a natural restlessness of being a teenager and of being ready to move on. 

That time of young adulthood left me believing in some of the principles of the Church — think of the Beatitudes as a good road map — but I was indifferent toward the Church teachings about the existence of God, Jesus Christ and the ceremonial trappings of the Church. 

(Truth be told, I was a doubting Thomas from even a young age. I drove my mother nuts when, at the age of 5 or so, I declared that I did not believe in God because I could not see him.) 

The last straw came about seven years when our oldest son came out as being gay. He was a sophomore in high school and active in a youth group in our local church. 

We got complaints from parish officials about him talking about his homosexuality with other kids. I took it as disapproval of his sexual orientation and I was plenty angry about it. 

But what frosted my rage cake came just a few weeks later. 

A young, popular parish priest was arrested for having child pornography on his computer. A church leader interviewed on the local cable TV news downplayed the significance of it. 

I’m paraphrasing, but he defended the priest as being a good guy and said, after all, it was not like this priest was touching kids or that any kids got hurt. 

In that moment, I lost my mind. We stopped attending church. We pulled our youngest son out of CCD. 

I haven’t looked back. 

But why do I feel as though I am missing out somehow? 

On Facebook I see friends, particularly classmates from my Catholic elementary school, who live a life filled with a deep abiding faith. 

There’s some part of me that’s envious and wonders how they do it. 

And now Pope Francis’ visit to the United States is stirring up more confusion for me. 

He seems to have a more welcoming and less judgmental view of the world. It’s heartening to see the example he’s set to literally embrace the poor, the imprisoned and the disenfranchised. 

But in the end, I’m left with questions: 

Can I practice what the Church preaches about charity toward all without the obligation of faith in its theological teachings? 

Can I be a good person without believing in God? 

Can you pursue a path of goodness without religion? 

If I believe that the answer to all three is a hearty yes, what is it then that I’m looking for?

I’m a Drive-Thru Catholic. Here are my (lapsed) credentials: Attended and graduated Catholic elementary school. Reasoning Sense After being a columnist in the New Yorker and in the New York Review of Books for four years, at that point my mean Gender Ground had become so restrictive of my masculinity that a full-time male editor had to acknowledge my new feminine identity saying, ""You had to live with a lot of responsibilities. That was like camping out there, living in a party, being a"," school during college; was born into Presbyterian church congregation on Sundays as children because it meant there were no family responsibilities like motherhood that she had always expected...and then went back home before finishing highschool after being ordained minister at Episcopal diocese one year ago when everyone came around for dinner so we could get together - until those parents stopped coming round...my religious mission just started working hard -- what did he do?""
The whole ""it´ll be OK if your partner doesn't follow something"" mindset does not really help anybody financially either. My husband has decided his mom will send him another child once our third son comes through out any week long....  My kid would probably end up saying things where an adult wouldn�t agree even though this sounds pretty great �but Mom's telling Dad..."" What seems particularly strange while doing business involves me spending time talking over two people (""I think Mum used tampons only now! She'll feel better later""). This means i don`c matter much"
37604e01-7c28-4129-b2ba-c58c73e0fedd,Top 10 burning questions for Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show',News,Belleville News Democrat,"Stephen Colbert, on Tuesday, will begin his tenure as the second host of CBS' ""The Late Show."" The debut will finally end more than a year of speculation about how he will handle the move from cable's ""The Colbert Report"" to the big network. One thing we know is that he'll bring on first-week guests including George Clooney, Jeb Bush and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Also, thanks to Colbert, America will finally get to see Amy Schumer on a talk show! As viewers await 10:30 Central time, here are the Top Ten - or at least ten of the top - things America wants to know. 

1. Who is the real Stephen Colbert? This question is top of mind because viewers have mostly seen the ""high-status idiot"" Colbert played for nine years on ""The Colbert Report."" But especially as the ""Report"" aged, Colbert gave us enough glimpses of the man behind the mask to suggest who we'll be getting: a well-read, fairly serious-minded Catholic father and family man who wants to have a say in national issues, although not as much as he wants to make people laugh. 

2. What will happen to ""Stephen Colbert""? This is a corollary to Question 1. That idiot was a great character, and he will be missed. But he probably won't go away completely. Interviewing Eminem as guest host this summer of ""Only in Monroe,"" a Monroe, Mich., cable-access show Colbert mostly kept on playing the fool, advising this Marshall Mathers person (Eminem's real name) that he needed to have a fallback position, like carpentry, in case music didn't work out. 

3. Can America handle a thoughtful late-night host? Colbert's favorite guests include the astronomer Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Tesla chief Elon Musk, and he knows more about ""The Lord of the Rings"" than anybody since J.R.R. Tolkien. But he is also goofy enough to delight in a good butt joke or giggle at someone's unusual name. Mentioning that the regular co-host of ""Only in Monroe"" is Kaye Lani Rae Rafko Wilson, Colbert said, ""I don't know how many people that is."" Given the increasingly obvious weightlessness of chief rival Jimmy Fallon, on NBC's ""Tonight Show,"" it's a good bet that a sizable chunk of America will prefer the impression Colbert conveys that gears are turning behind the grin. 

4. How will Colbert remain subversive on the big stage? When his predecessor at CBS, David Letterman, started at 10:30 p.m., America saw Letterman transform from the gleeful near-anarchist of later night to, for a time, big-top ringmaster, and it wasn't always pretty. Colbert, similar to early Letterman, has delighted in messing with people's heads on Comedy Central. All the interviews he's given about ""Late Show"" thus far suggest he's going to try to keep the freak flag flying. He told GQ this summer, in the most soulful celebrity profile you'll ever read, that he revels in creating uncomfortable moments. But the greater ratings demands at CBS can be a profoundly mainstreaming force. 

5. How will Colbert remain meaningful on the big stage? On Comedy Central, he aimed satire and plain outrage at such targets as Amazon's dominance of the book market, mistreatment of farm workers and loopholes that let rich folk dominate political campaign funding. Will CBS let him be so pointed? Will the American people? Colbert sounds like he wants to keep trying. Speaking to advertisers in the spring, he promised to ""occasionally make the network very angry at us."" And already he has engaged with first-night guest and Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. Learning that Bush was raffling off a ticket the show as a campaign fundraiser, Colbert answered with his own raffle of a ticket, to benefit injured service members. 

6. What's the show's humor going to be like? For one thing, there'll be no more testicle jokes, he told GQ. And Colbert offered a preview of one show aspect to television critics last month. A video parody of erectile dysfunction medication ads offered ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" as a remedy for people who can't ""stay up"" late, AV Club reported. Earlier in the year, during his inventive summer break (he also did a series of fascinating backstage podcasts), he felt moved to put out a video of himself imitating Donald Trump as he began ""the finest, most luxurious, gold-plated, diamond-encrusted campaign."" 

7. How can Colbert make the bandleader genuinely part of the TV show? He signed on a great musician and promising personality in New Orleans artist Jon Batiste. But inevitably the format reduces such people to a few quick answers of the host's questions and playing during the commercials for the studio audience. In favor of Batiste having a bigger role is that Colbert, like Fallon, is a pretty musical guy, always willing to sing or dance. 

8. Will Colbert's ""Late Show"" have a signature bit? Letterman, of course, had his nightly Top Ten List, a comedy format so popular that he was stuck with it. If his ""Late Show"" takes after ""The Colbert Report,"" Colbert might have a stable of regular segments but not one he rides every night. Most potent of those was ""The Word,"" a sort of essay/rant on a topic of some significance, done in what felt close to Colbert's real persona. When Colbert offered a ""Word,"" viewers knew they'd be getting a funny, sharp, well-crafted piece of writing unlike anything else in late night. May ""The Word,"" or something like it, remain. 

9. How will Colbert be as an interviewer? We know he's pretty skilled at the comedy thing and at keeping a show together and on point over time (""intentionality"" is the word he uses). And it was fascinating to watch him walk the tightrope of doing interviews in character on ""The Report."" But how will he do when he is talking to another human being as himself? The bet is, very well: His range of knowledge and interests prepares him to enrich interviews, and his improv training at Chicago's Second City teaches him to be in the moment reacting to the other person, rather than just reading from a question list. Colbert told TV critics last month that he is itching to have ""honest interest in my guests."" 

10. Has the late-night format been so devalued that no amount of talent and smarts can save it? If this turns out to be the case, Colbert will have only himself - well, himself and Jon Stewart and now John Oliver - to blame. Their shows on Comedy Central and HBO have made traditional late-night shows, by comparison, look anemic, formulaic and featherweight. The notion of whether it is simply too late for late shows, creatively, is probably the biggest question of all, and reinvigorating that format is Colbert's greatest challenge.",1129,"Stephen Colbert, on Tuesday, will begin his tenure as the second host of CBS' ""The Late Show.""

This section of the tale is about her meeting the one who will release her—in the Grimm’s tale, it’s the prince, and in the Disney version, it’s Flynn, the thief. Either way, for her to entertain him is an act of defiance and subversion. This girl just wants to have some fun for once! Leo, creativity and self-discovery
Even the synopsis of the Disney film on IMDB emphasizes the self-discovery aspect of the tale: “The magically long-haired Rapunzel has spent her entire life in a tower, but now that a runaway thief has stumbled upon her, she is about to discover the world for the first time, and who she really is.” In Tangled, Rapunzel is extremely creative with her time, which is very Leo of her. She paints, cooks, makes pottery, and literally swings from the ceiling by her hair. She covers every wall and ceiling with beautiful drawings and reads all the books she possesses over and over again. She even plays chess. In the Grimm’s tale the prince is drawn to her by hearing her sing—another creative act. Rapunzel is bursting with self-development. The symbolism of golden hair
Hair is lush, sensual and a means for expression. Leo, being the Lion, is always aware of the mane. Her long hair, always blonde, (this is a German tale after all) is a symbol of lushness and golden beauty. Like gold, she is coveted, first by her parents, then by Mother Gothel, then by the Prince/Flynn. In the Disney tale her hair is coveted for its healing powers. At the end, Flynn is willing to die rather than exploit the healing hair one more time—even though Rapunzel is willing to sacrifice her newfound freedom to save him. This is his growth in the story, which he begins as a thief, coveting a tiara he had stolen from the palace. He learns to value love over money. Mother Gothel, who covets the hair for its ability to restore her youth, receives the ultimate lesson—and dies of it. Read the next post: Love and Rebellion. Begin this article series here.

Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto addresses the audience during his third state of the union address at the National Palace in Mexico City, September 2, 2015. 
    
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced his government’s budget for 2016 last week, detailing a series of cuts and other measures aimed to indicate the “government’s commitment to maintain the country’s fiscal and macroeconomic stability,” according to Eurasia Group . 
 
But, to some, the Peña Nieto administration’s cuts to several important security programs signal a more worrying trend. 
 
“If security is a priority of the current administration, it is not visible in this budget proposal,” said Alejandro Hope, the security and justice editor at El Daily Post. 
 ‘Eliminating the inertia’  
The government’s 2016 budget, according to Hope , will cut funding and subsidies for local law enforcement by nearly 2.9 billion pesos, or about $172 million. 
 
Most of the cutting affects state-level spending, in particular two funds that bolstered local police forces. 
 
  
 
All told, Hope writes , for state-level security spending, “One out of every five pesos received in 2015 won’t be there in 2016.

Police officers stand guard as members of the teacher’s union CNTE (not pictured) march past the Revolution Monument in Mexico City, June 1, 2015. 
    
The government said this move was for “ eliminating the inertia ” that has hindered local crime-fighting programs. “Inertia,” according to Hope, may refer to widespread corruption that has plagued government projects. 
 
At the federal level, the National Crime Prevention Program will take a roughly $35.6 million cut. The Interior ministry, which runs that program and almost all federal security programs, will see its investment budget slashed by 77%. 
 
The Federal Attorney General’s office will also sustain a 92% cut in investment funds, down to about $4 million next year from $53.4 million this year. 
 
Cuts in investment spending will mean new projects — like modernization efforts — will take a hit firth, as opposed to limiting day-to-day operations. However, with the country’s homicide rate ticking up in recent months, any cuts at all are likely to spur popular concern.

Hope notes  the cuts also signal that criminal prosecution is not being prioritized, a worrying development given government missteps in investigating the kidnapping and killing of 43 students in southern Mexico — a case that continues to receive international attention . 
 
The government doling out fewer pesos to local authorities may have a more proximate cause than the slump in global oil prices: corruption. 
 
Mexico’s public-spending watchdog, the federal audit office, found more than 50 irregularities in public security funding, affecting more than $33 million in public money, in just four of Mexico’s 31 states, including Sinaloa — a historical center of the drug trade and home to notorious drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán .

The budget proposal was not without positive steps. 
 
According to Eurasia Group, Peña Nieto’s government also included measures to benefit local private sector firms. Among other things, it will allow the firms to make immediate tax deductions and repatriate capital. 
 
Other steps to counteract the cuts include expanded public-private partnerships and bond offerings to increase private-firm participation in public projects, like education and oil exploration. 
 
Beyond cuts to security programs, however, there are reasons for concern. 
 
The cuts, as Eurasia Group notes, will negatively affect growth, which, coupled with oil prices that won’t budge and lingering market uncertainty, may keep the Mexican economy from meeting deficit and growth targets. (The government bumped 2016 growth estimates down to a 2.6%-3.6% range, down from 3.3%-4.3%). 
 
The decline in oil prices has been especially problematic for Peña Nieto. It has undermined the source of one-third of the government’s income, and while the government doesn’t plan to cut oil production goals , infrastructure shortcomings and corruption challenges at state-run oil company Pemex may undercut the country’s ability to maintain current production levels. 
 
(The government’s budget also included the lowest amount proposed for oil exploration in nine years, leaving room for foreign companies to expand into the sector.)

Mexico’s oil industry, saddled for years with bloated costs, chronic underinvestment, and generous government fuel subsidies, received shake-up in October that dismantled the state-run Pemex oil and gas monopoly, ending decades of self-reliance and potentially opening the door to foreign oil companies. 
    ‘Strict austerity measures’  
With just 30% approval for his handling of the economy, Peña Nieto’s government has emphasized its efforts to ensure a solid economic footing in the face of recent economic uncertainty.

Budget cuts in 2015 were characterized as a “ preventive adjustment .” 
 
The plan for 2016, which contains a spending cuts that equal 1.15% of GDP, or $13.15 billion, is to build “less costly but more efficient” government, in the words of Finance Secretary Luis Videgary. 
 
During comments this week, Videgaray doubled down on this sentiment. 
 
“The main goal of this package, given the international economic circumstances, is to preserve the stability of our economy,” he said on September 8. 
 
Comments issued by Videgaray’s boss the week before the budget proposal may signal a more worrying trend, however.

224b3ede-5f14-400c-b880-4a117bf9986e,Andy Murray hopes to go on the attack in round three,News,Southern Daily Echo,"Andy Murray is determined to turn defence into attack when he takes on France's Adrian Mannarino in the US Open second round. 
 
Murray has been eager to add more variety and creativity to his game this year but the Scot was on the back foot for much of his four-set victory against Nick Kyrgios on Tuesday. 
 
The Australian's explosive style of play largely restricted Murray to a night of counter-punching but Mannarino is likely to offer more attacking opportunities in round two. 
 
""It was hard for me to go out there against Nick and be really aggressive or play the way I wanted to, it's very hard against him,"" Murray said. 
 
""He's a very powerful guy. He goes for unpredictable shots. You don't know exactly what to expect each point. 
 
""A lot of the time I felt like I was just reacting and ended up having to do quite a bit of defending and running because of that. 
 
""But against him, you're going to have to play that way at times. 
 
""Hopefully in the next round I'll have a little bit more time, be a little bit more comfortable out on the court and be able to play a little bit different."" 
 
Murray beat Mannarino 6-3 6-3 when the pair met at Indian Wells in March but the Frenchman, ranked 35th in the world, can be an awkward opponent as proven by a surprise win over Stan Wawrinka in Miami earlier this year. 
 
""It'll be a tricky match,"" Murray said. 
 
""He's a very talented left-hander, who hits the ball very flat on both sides. But I grew up playing my brother who is left-handed."" 
 
Murray added: ""I had a pretty tough match with him in Indian Wells earlier in the year. 
 
""He has very short, compact swings and excellent timing. He's quick. He's a good athlete. 
 
""He has very good hands, he's a talented guy. He's had some good results this year so it will be a tough match, for sure.""

Konta, currently on a 14-match winning streak, takes on Spain's ninth seed Garbine Muguruza, while Bedene is up against American Donald Young. 
 
Bedene won the pair's only previous meeting in Vienna three years ago and admits he may seek advice from Murray and James Ward, who both faced the American in the Davis Cup this year.

d57c679c-9063-4544-b0d5-73d880bbbd31,Redmayne impresses in trans film,News,IOL,"Venice — Eddie Redmayne is perfect casting for “The Danish Girl,” in all respects but one. 

					  		     
His character in the fact-based drama, Lili Elbe, was born Einar Wegener in late 19th-century Denmark and became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Redmayne is an acclaimed, Academy Award-winning actor — but he’s not a transgender woman, and some trans activists have expressed unease at his casting in the historically important role. 

					  		     
Director Tom Hooper acknowledged Saturday that the film industry has “a problem” including transgender actors. 

					  		     
“There is a huge pool of talented trans actors and the access to parts is limited,” Hooper told reporters at the Venice Film Festival, where “The Danish Girl” is getting its world premiere. 

					  		     
Hooper said there are two transgender actors in the film, both in non-trans roles. But for the lead, he never wanted anyone other than Redmayne, with whom he worked on big-screen musical “Les Miserables.” 

					  		     
“Eddie was my instinctive choice,” Hooper said. “I’ve worked with him before (and) I’m incredibly excited by him as an actor.” 

						  				  		        		    		  		     
And, he added: “I do think there’s something in Eddie that’s drawn to the feminine.” 

					  		     
Redmayne took the responsibility of playing Lili seriously, and met many transgender men and women in preparation for the role. 

					  		     
“Their kindness and their support sort of galvanized me,” he said. 

					  		     
“The entire experience for me was the most brilliant education on many, many things.” 

					  		     
Tracing Lili’s journey from denial to acceptance to rebirth in the face of a hostile society, “The Danish Girl” sensitively depicts a journey of self-discovery undertaken without a road map. 

					  		     
The film is already generating talk of a second Oscar for Redmayne, who won the best-actor trophy this year for playing scientist Stephen Hawking in “The Theory of Everything.” 

						  				  		        		    		  		     
Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, who plays Einar’s artist wife Gerda, is also a likely awards contender. Hooper said Gerda was an “extraordinary” character whose love for her husband — and artistic talent — made Lili’s emergence possible. 

					  		     
Hooper said Gerda’s importance to Lili’s story underscored the film’s theme: “the inclusion that is made possible through love.” 

					  		     
“We live in a deeply divided world,” said Hooper, who won a directing Oscar in 2011 for “The King’s Speech.” 

					  		     
“I mean, what’s happening on the shores of Europe at the moment, the extraordinary refugee crisis that reaches out to us at the moment, is an appeal to our hearts. 

					  		     
“What happens to transgender men and women when they suffer persecution, when they suffer indignity, what’s happening with the instances of violence in the U.S., is an appeal to our hearts. 

					  		     
“What I hope the film shows is the only way to make possible inclusion, really, is through compassion and love,” he said.

ceaa31e5-8504-444e-9e0b-35fd5362120c,Will yet another Greek vote spark new debt crisis?,News,WTWO,"Greeks heading to the polls again Sunday

Greeks are heading to the polls Sunday, for the third time this year. And once again, Europe is holding its breath. 

The election result is too close to call and neither of the main parties -- left-wing Syriza and conservative New Democracy -- are likely to win a clear majority in parliament. 

Both are committed to reforms Greece needs to implement in order to receive more bailout cash promised by European countries in July. 

So everything's fine, then? Not quite. 

Greece needs a government to deal with its economic crisis, keep the bailout on track, and cope with the challenge of thousands of refugees flocking to its shores. An inconclusive election result could mean delay in forming a coalition, or worse, yet another election. 

Unless a new government gets to work quickly, Greece risks being unable to get more money from Europe. That would leave it unable to pay 3.2 billion euros ($3.8 billion) it owes to the International Monetary Fund later this year. 

""Greece is not sustainable and the big issues are how far the program will go off track and how many eurozone members will join Germany in viewing missed targets as no longer a price worth paying,"" said Gabriel Sterne, the head of global macro research at Oxford Economics. 

The rescue agreed in July with Europe, worth up to 86 billion euros ($97 billion), prevented financial collapse and kept Greece in the euro. But the IMF says Greece desperately needs ""substantial"" debt relief. Without it, the country may once again find itself unable to pay its bills in the long term. 

Europe has been unwilling to talk about that, saying the first review of Greece's economic reforms must come first. The longer that is delayed, the greater the pressure on Greek finances. 

All the while, the Greek economy sinks deeper into the mire. 

""We've seen a big drop in economic sentiment, we've seen big drops in imports and exports, so there's likely to be a big slowdown in the economy,"" Raoul Ruparel, a director of Open Europe, told CNN. 

Greek GDP is expected to shrink by 2.3% this year and by 1.3% next year. Unemployment stands at 25%, and real wages are declining.",399,"Greeks heading to the polls again Sunday By Updated 09/18 2015 02:15PM Copyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

Both are committed to reforms Greece needs to implement in order to receive more bailout money if Greece are to receive as much as 18% of the country's 11.7 billion euros in public investment. A reform agenda that recognizes the party's past achievements could yield the only clear result largely because the whole country is looking at polls again. Not so Palestinians, Palestinians were repeatedly slammed last week for refusing to share the issue publicly just two months ago. Then there was a shocking tweet from"," money from Brussels that could make public housing better funded rather than put some pressure on private developers' banks where Athens does have reserves - something many believe would help boost development there even if only temporarily since lenders will still need funds as emergency measures should no longer exist so building starts up over their objections with one day's notice being given away at all times (in most cases until they end). However such policies fall far short compared mainly because it falls across much smaller regions like Macedonia who do tendentious business dealing mostly directly into those areas while under huge pressures related partly by EU support against austerity programmes led primarily towards western European countries trying desperately – but perhaps controversially when asked ""who cares what about Bulgaria?"", which can easily include people fleeing war torn Ukraine currently struggling largely due westward expansionist neo German economic plan [1],

DEKRA is the sponsor of the DEKRA Green Challenge Award, which is presented to the most environmentally clean, fast, and efficient GT Le Mans (GTLM) competitor in each TUDOR United SportsCar Championship Race. 

The DEKRA Green Challenge Award is a centerpiece of the Green Racing partnership between the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). DEKRA consults with IMSA to review Green Challenge results to ensure they conform to the established scoring criteria. 
   
""DEKRA has a long tradition of involvement with elite motorsports events and series, and we are very excited to be partnering with IMSA and the TUDOR Championships,"" said Donald O. Nicholson, CEO and President of DEKRA NA. ""As a leader in automotive emissions and safety testing and sustainability, we are proud to sponsor the DEKRA Green Challenge Award, which recognizes these elite green racers."" 
  
All of the GTLM class teams competing in the TUDOR Championship must utilize alternative fuels, either E85, E10 or biodiesel. E85 and E10 are made from 85 and 10 percent ethanol respectively and are derived from products grown by U.S. farmers. The GTLM Class is the only class within the TUDOR Series that uses E85. Currently, all but one of the GTLM teams uses E85. These alternative fuels are relevant to the world's automotive manufacturers and energy companies as they develop transportation solutions for the future that are sustainable and have a low environmental impact. 

The Green Challenge scores are calculated each lap of the race from data provided by the timing and scoring system plus the observed energy consumption -- or fuel used -- of each car from refueling tank sensors. The score for ""clean"" is based on a rating of each car's environmental impact determined by adding together the greenhouse gases emitted and non-renewable energy (petroleum consumed) by each car during the race. ""Fast"" describes the average on-track speed of each car compared to the leader (recalculated for every lap) in kilometers per hour. ""Efficiency"" is measured by how well each car used the energy it consumed based on the car's observed fuel consumption and performance, corrected to the performance profile and weight of the leader. 

""Much of the interest in ethanol as a vehicle fuel is its ability to replace gasoline made from imported oil,"" said Nicholson. ""E85 fuel also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and it is made from ethanol produced in the U.S. from corn grown by American farmers. DEKRA is excited to be part of this new vision for the future."" 

DEKRA also serves as IMSA's Official Technical Partner, operating in conjunction with IMSA during the TUDOR Series technical inspection process of each race car to ensure IMSA regulations and standards are being followed. As unbiased, third-party experts, DEKRA adds credibility to IMSA's technical and safety inspection process. 

Every TUDOR Championship race car is inspected at the DEKRA Technical Center and receives a DEKRA decal showing that it has met IMSA's regulations and technical standards. While IMSA's specs are unique, DEKRA has a similarly rigorous process for the safety and quality inspections it offers corporate and consumer clients. DEKRA is the leading consumer and commercial vehicle testing organization in the world with 26 million inspections conducted annually. 

The 2015 TUDOR Championship season opened at Daytona International Speedway with the 53rd Rolex 24 At Daytona. There are 12 races each year across the U.S. and Canada, which attract over a million fans and include racers from Audi, BMW, Chevrolet, Corvette, Ford, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Porsche, SRT, Ferrari, and Lamborghini.

In this post I'm going through my suggestions if any have been applied along any way imaginable before; in addition there are still other things worthy! That means at least six specific ideas will be added as we go further towards creating more fun arrangements...

2.) Make The Guests Dance… It might sound complicated... but maybe try trying these seven minutes without anyone interrupting them enough makes sense - especially since our weddings involve lots less dancing than usual. Instead let me suggest five options then : 1) Try bringing your son(s)! He may enjoy playing those very important tunes over his parents' guitars too :) 2), Consider turning off/restart recording devices & making new ones!! 3 ) Letting Your Daughter Have Her Fun Once A Day is also an obvious thingy suggestion -- don't forget no matter how cute she sounds AFTER her kids come"
d46349c8-7eb1-47d5-b8d6-8fc834019580,Could You Be Eating Microbeads? It Is Time We Ban Them,Blog,Green Blog on The Huffington Post,"Johanna B., Grade 1, Minnesota, NOAA Marine Debris Program
 
 Microbeads, those tiny bits of plastic found in personal care products from skin lotions to shaving cream, and even toothpaste, are poisoning our water systems and entering our food chain, and at the end, our bodies. 
 
 More people are recognizing the science behind the toxicity of those microbeads, per the article in the Washington Post that reports that eight trillion beads, enough to cover eight football fields, enter our water each day. And plastics are forever. 
 
 Now is the time to ask your local, state, and federal representatives to ban the bead, as a federal bill, proposed by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, to ban the microbead nationally, the bipartisan Microbead Free Waters Act of 2015, begins, we can only hope, its journey from The House of Representatives to the Senate and then to The President's desk. Its hard to imagine any reason to vote against it. No one wants to eat poison. Industry is ready to transition with a new law. 
 
 As an upstater, Senator is well aware of how these beads are now turning up in fish in The Great Lakes, and from there where else besides. According to a report released by NYS Attorney General Schneiderman's office, 'microbeads were present in 74% of water samples taken from 34 municipal and private [sewage] treatment plants across New York State.' New York is very familiar with the issue. In turn, the Senator knows this is an issue for all Americans, and has been working closely with various Great Lakes senators -- Mark Kirk, Rob Portman, Debbie Stabenow, Gary Peters, Sharod Breon, and Tammy Baldwin -- to pass a bill that would ban these beads from our products and our waters.
 
 Once the beads go down the drain, they become magnets for toxins, such as dioxins and volatile organic chemicals found in our waters due to pesticides and industrial pollution. They're are so tiny that our sewage treatment systems can't filter them. From there, they end up in our lakes, our bays, the ocean, eventually into us, by the fish that eat the beads and we in turn eat. The top of the food chain ends up with the highest concentrations of them in tissue. 
 
 Unilever has voluntarily removed microbeads from their products. However, we still have Johnson & Johnson (Neutrogena for example), P&G (Olay), Estee Lauder, and many dozens of personal care product makers like Ahava, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, CVS, Rite Aid, Dior, Walmart and Kiehls knowingly contributing to the degradation of our marine food. 
 
 Here is a convenient list of all the major products containing microbeads from 5gyres.org, an organization dedicated getting plastics out of our waters. Not surprisingly, the plastics industry lobby has been very active to block legislation to ban the bead, for instance in California. If this ban should go to national vote, you can bet lobby-ists already have loopholes mapped out. 
 
 
 Political Corruption First, Meaningful Legislation Later
 
 Efforts to ban the microbead in New York State in 2014 and 2015 tells you a lot about Albany, and about the many other state houses held captive by lobbyists. In 2014, The New York State Assembly voted 133-1 to ban the bead. The vote never even got to the New York State Senate. The Majority Leader at the time, Dean Skelos, was busy funneling water remediation business to his son, so it's no surprise he didn't find this piece of legislation a priority. The plastics industry, it is widely believed, blocked it from coming to a vote, just as they had done in California in 2014.
 
 This year, the Assembly again in 2015 voted overwhelmingly for the ban at 139-0, but again the bill never reached the floor in the Senate, supposedly because of the disarray caused by Skelo's multiple indictments for corruption, along with those former Speaker Sheldon Silver now faces. The two main fixers in Albany are no longer in power. Meanwhile the plastics industry had their lobbyists on hand to ensure nothing happens. 
 
 What to do when your state legislature refuses to vote on a bill to ban a substance that brings toxins into our environment, into the tissues of fish, shellfish, birds, reptiles, into the food chain, and eventually into us, even though industry itself is amenable to removing the substance, and they do that two years in a row?
 
 
 Piecemeal Local and State Bans
 
 Here's the good news in 2015. Laws to ban microbeads statewide passed in California and in Connecticut. People are reading the science. Grassroots efforts from a number of environmental nonprofits have made a difference. This issue can be quickly won at this point, given the momentum.
 
 Illinois also voted to ban microbeads, sorta. As many called out, this bill was written with a big assist from The Chemical Industry Council with a pretty loophole that the beads could be substituted out with corn-based plastic so-called 'biodegradable' microbeads. These corn-based plastics take a long time to degrade and only at very high temperatures. Perhaps the CIC and Illinois Senate are counting on boiling off the oceans due to global warming? 
 
 With Illinois as the model legislation, other so-called, 'bans' were recently passed in New Jersey and Maine, with the same industry friendly bit of greenwashing being proposed in other states. 
 
 We've also seen local bans passed this year, such as in Erie County, NY, and just yesterday Chautauqua County. If a county enacts a ban, it puts pressure on industry to standardize the non-polluting version of the product, and makes a stronger case at the State House to implement a statewide ban. 
 
 While we environmentalists feel very much like Charlie Brown with Lucy and the football, it is our expectation that we can get a ban passed in Albany in 2016. Meanwhile we are building up local support for a ban, county by county.
 
 Suffolk County currently has a bill to ban the bead sitting in the hands of its legislature. Long Island has a storied environmental history. We began the ban on DDT. Our patron saint is Teddy Roosevelt. Here is our opportunity to lead by example and insist that microbeads be banned for the good of our many bays and the ocean itself, not to mention our fisheries, and the health of Long Islanders.
 
 But what about the other 3005 counties in the U.S.? Local bans get the ball rolling, but we need broader solutions and quickly. These beads know no county lines. They flow into our streams, rivers, and lakes. 
 
 For that matter, they know no state boundaries either. I think we'd all agree that relitigating this across all 3000+ counties and all 50 states would be a huge waste of energy, though profitable for lobbyists, of course. This is a serious global issue. We share one ocean. No one anywhere should be putting these in their products, for the sake of us all. This issue must be addressed by Congress as a national ban. 
 
 Ban Nationally Now
 
 We've seen a growing call to ban microbeads at every level. This is a national and global concern. This should be a unanimous slam-dunk for Congress: A national ban on microbeads. 
 Industry would embrace it because it wants clarity in the market. Hunters and fishermen don't want them in their game. We consumers don't want to eat them.
 
 Let both of our senators in each state know that here at least is an issue we can all agree on, that we don't need 8 trillion plastic particles entering our waters every day. 
 
 Find out if there's a law pending at the county and state level, and if there is, make sure it isn't being written by the personal care industry or the chemical / plastics industries. That's happening all over.
 
 There are natural substitutes. We want fish that is healthy to eat today and a hundred years from now. Who of our elected representatives are actually serving national interests? Who do you need to call?
 
 Send a letter to your Senators and Congressman in support of The Microbead Free Waters Act of 2015. One place to go is Oh Say Nation, which helps you to email a message to your Senators and Congressman directly on this or any other issue. Just write in Microbeads as the issue. 
 
 Thank you! They must be banned and we can't let industry slip in any fake 'biodegradable' substitutes. People before profits.

However, this summer was going to be different. My extended family was visiting from Canada and I had gotten a student worker position at the Undergraduate Admission Office. I knew it was going to be impossible to take an extended vacation so my friend, who was also staying in at Fordham College at Lincoln Center, decided to come up with a summer bucket list to complete. We complied our list based on two things: the events had to be free or cheap and within two hours of driving distance for any day trips. So over the month of June, we participated in free yoga and Latin dance classes that were taking place in Bryant Park. Also, many parks around New York City were screening free outdoor movie nights. We caught the all time classic Back to the Future at Bryant Park and Frozen at Randall’s Island. You can drive into Randall’s Island if taking the RFK Bridge from Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx. If coming in from Manhattan, a cheaper option is to take the walking passageway or one of the MTA local buses that frequently make trips to the island.             For my water lovers, I was able to able to take multiple free kayaking trips in the Hudson River. The two most popular locations are Pier 96 uptown and Pier 26 downtown. What I really love about the NYC free kayaking program is how accessible and easy it is. I went to Pier 26 a total of three times and every time I went before 10 am, I barely had to wait in line. There is a waiver that you have to sign but the good news is that you do it once, and it’s good for the rest of the season. There are single and double kayaks available as well as free lockers, lock, life jacket, and a changing room. For the perfect afternoon activity with your partner in crime or significant other, Central Park offers daily boat rides that you can enjoy right at the heart of the city. While not free, boating was a lot of fun because of the beautiful location and atmosphere. For people seeking a little more thrill, we did drive out to the Six Flags Great Adventure Hurricane Harbor water park in New Jersey. If you don’t have a car, not to fear! There are group buses that take folks into six flags from Manhattan. For the perfect day beach trip, we headed out to the shores of Jersey to Long Branch Beach. It’s a cute little resort town about two hour drive from NYC but also accessible via the NJ transit as well. Long Branch does a really good job at making us forget we’re still in the tri-state area with its gorgeous sand dunes and palm trees.             Last but not the very least, no vacation is complete without exploring the local food scene! Summer is a great time to dine out in NYC because of the many different food festivals and events that take place. Taking advantage of Restaurant Week, I tried out Korean, Mexican, and Mediterranean fine dining. Another really cool way to explore new kinds of food was going to the Smorgasburg food fair that takes place in various locations around the city every week. They promote 100 local vendors of various world cuisines and it’s basically a one-stop shop for any form of food craving you could possibly want. I tried vegan burgers, Ethiopian food, Hawaiian food, Vietnamese food, as well as a variety of ice cream shops in my visits. As you can see, there are plenty of ways to enjoy NYC that doesn’t have to include going to all the tourist attractions. I completed my first summer bucket list here in my “hometown” and I can’t wait to see which city to explore next year!  Long Branch Beach, New Jersey Smorgasburg eats at East River State Park, Williamsburg",676,"As a local New Yorker, my family is always planning vacations to escape the concrete jungle we call home during the summer months.

1.) No money needed beyond $75 per person = 25% off!

e0aae584-a6ee-4d98-84a8-88245c9a9d86,Looking Up: Find the double star cluster,News,Canton Repository,"Looking high in the northeast after darkness falls, the glittering stars of the “BIG W” shine forth. No, not a neon sign for a chain department store. This is the constellation Cassiopeia, whose five principal stars wonderfully form the letter “W.” Of course it depends on orientation. Sometimes it appears like an “M.” While the constellation is rising in the northeast, the “W” is more on its side. In early September around 1 a.m., it is high up in the north, perhaps straight overhead where you live. It is then shaped like an “M.” Twelve hours later, the constellation is at its low point, and appears as a true “W.” At this time of year, that is close to 1 in the afternoon. The “W” is there, just like all the rest of the stars, but you won’t see it in broad daylight. The only star you can see by day is the Sun! Like all constellations, Cassiopeia seems to circle around an imaginary point on the sky next to the North Star. Directly opposite from Cassiopeia on the other side of the North Star is the famed seven stars of the Big Dipper. The Earth’s rotation, of course, makes the sky seems to spin around. As we advance towards new moon on Sept. 13, we can enjoy moonless nights, and the maaximum amount of stars you can see. Cassiopeia is amidst the hazy glow of the Milky Way Band which at this time of year in the evening extends across the sky and down in the south. The view with eyes alone is spectacular enough, but just try it with binoculars! With binoculars, scan the stars the next September evening just below the “W” on its side. Look below the “W”’s bottom segment, by a little more than the length of that segment. You should quickly be able to spot the “Double Cluster,” a pair of open star clusters of similar brightness and size. With unaided eyes under a dark sky you can see the Double Cluster as a small pair of fuzzy patches. Binoculars will begin to reveal the myriad stars in each cluster. The view in a small telescope at low power is stunning. The planet Saturn may be currently seen low in the southwest once darkness falls, appearing like a bright star. If you arise early (or stay up very late), look low in the eastern sky about an hour before sunrise. Venus is very bright. To the upper left is the planet Mars, much dimmer and reddish. Be sure to look on the mornings of Sept. 9, 10 and 11, should skies be clear. The crescent moon will be gliding between Venus and Mars. Mark your calendar: North America is favored by a total lunar eclipse on Sunday evening Sept. 27! An upcoming column will discuss this further. Keep looking up! Page 2 of 2 - Peter W.

f55e7f41-0912-4ad5-917a-a3e07b9f4f2e,"Sunday heat flirts with records, but likely Bay Area's worst of the week",News,Milpitas Post,"Bay Area residents endured sweltering heat Sunday that flirted with or broke record highs, but it appears the worst of the torrid temps have passed. 

According to the National Weather Service, temperatures will dip modestly Monday, then drop sharply Tuesday and Wednesday as sea breezes and a low-pressure system from the Pacific Northwest are expected to provide welcome relief during summer's final days. 

""You'll really notice it on Tuesday,"" said Larry Smith, a meteorologist with the weather service's Bay Area forecast office.

But not before Sunday rewrote some weather history.

""It's safe to say a few records have fallen,"" Smith said.

That was the case in three Bay Area locales. Richmond saw a high of 96 degrees, surpassing the record of 94 set in 1967. In Gilroy, the day's 104-degree mark topped the previous high of 101 set in 2000. And San Francisco International Airport recorded a Sunday peak of 96 degrees, toppling the record of 94 degrees reached in 1990.

And while they didn't break records, other Bay Area cities simmered: San Jose hit 95, Oakland had 91, Livermore saw 98. Palo Alto matched its record high, recorded in 1958, of 95 degrees.

Monday stands to see a drop-off of a few degrees, Smith said. But it's still going to be warm enough for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to declare a second straight Spare the Air alert, the ninth issued for the summer. 

Alert days are characterized by clear skies, hot temperatures and light winds that combine to produce high-ozone levels and smoggy skies, and residents are advised to refrain from driving and other air-polluting activities. The heat didn't faze Jill Shanmugasundaram, who grew up in Southern California.

""If you can sit in the shade, you'll be fine,'' she said while walking toward the San Pedro Square Market in downtown San Jose, where lots of folks were snacking and drinking under the shade of umbrellas.

New VTA bus driver Sandep Batra, 30, said a lot of homeless people were riding his Route 72 air-conditioned bus to escape the heat.

""They'll hop on just to try to stay cool,'' he said, adding that he'll let them on out of concern for their health even if they don't have the fare.

Sunnyvale resident Jolie Olsen, sought similar relief indoors at the San Pedro market and cited a recent experience that gave her a fresh perspective on the Bay Area heat: She just returned from the Middle Eastern country of Oman, where the mercury lurched up to 125 degrees.

""It was this glorious feeling when I got off the plane,'' she said about returning to the relative California cool. ""I never appreciated it before.""

(StatePoint) College course materials can be cheaper than most college students think. Book and supplies only account for four percent of the cost of attending college among the top 10 most populous colleges and universities (using population rankings from “Forbes”). Books themselves are just a fraction of that four percent. However, during a time when many institutions are raising tuition and other fees, students are finding new ways to cut spending on these materials.   

Student spending on course materials this past year was an estimated 20 percent less than the 2007 to 2008 school year, according to statistics from Student Watch, developed by the National Association of College Stores. This decline can be attributed to innovative offerings from educational publishing companies, such as adaptive learning platforms, eBooks, eChapters, looseleaf editions, black-and-white editions and print-it-yourself editions. 

New platforms are not only helping reduce textbook prices, they are increasing student success, say experts. Digital learning presents content in more engaging and interactive ways than traditional counterparts.

Wells These building blocks of life are constantly changing. They can spontaneously express different proteins and genes, change shape and size, die or resist dying, or become damaged and cancerous. Even within a population of the same type of cell, there is immense random variability between cells' structures, levels of protein expression, and sizes. ""High dimensionality and noise are inherent properties of large intracellular networks,"" said Adilson E. Motter, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Physics and Astronomy in Northwestern University's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences. ""Both have long been regarded as obstacles to the rational control of cellular behavior."" ... more about:
»Arts and Sciences »Network »Noise »biological networks »cancerous »ecosystem collapses »gene regulation »living cells »power grid »power grids »proteins Motter and his collaborators at Northwestern have challenged and redefined this long-held belief. Using a newly-developed computational algorithm, they showed that this randomness within and among cells, called ""noise,"" can be manipulated to control the networks that govern the workings of living cells -- promoting cellular health and potentially alleviating diseases such as cancer. Supported by the National Cancer Institute Physical Science-Oncology Center at Northwestern and the National Science Foundation, the research is described in the September 16 issue of the journal Physical Review X. Motter and William L. Kath, professor of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics, are coauthors of the paper. Daniel K.Wells, a graduate student in applied math, is the paper's first author. ""Noise refers to the random aspects of cell behavior, especially gene regulation,"" Wells said. ""Gene regulation is not like a train station, where gene expression-regulating proteins are shipped in at regular intervals, turn a gene on or off, and then are shipped out. Instead, gene expression is constantly, and randomly, being modified."" By leveraging noise, the team found that the high-dimensional gene regulatory dynamics could be controlled instead by controlling a much smaller and simpler network, termed a ""network of state transitions."" In this network cells randomly transition from one phenotypic state to another -- sometimes from states representing healthy cell phenotypes to unhealthy states where the conditions are potentially cancerous. The transition paths between these states can be predicted, as cells making the same transition will typically travel along similar paths in their gene expression. The team compares this phenomenon to the formation of pathways at a university campus. If there is no paved path between a pair of buildings, people will usually taken the path that is the easiest to traverse, tromping down the grass to reveal the dirt beneath. Eventually, campus planners may see this pre-defined path and pave it. Similarly, upon initially analyzing a gene regulatory network the team first used noise to define the most-likely transition pathway between different system states, and connected these paths into the network of state transitions. By doing so the researchers could then focus on just one path between any two states, distilling a multi-dimensional system to a series of one-dimensional interconnecting paths. ""Even in systems as complex and high-dimensional as a gene regulatory network, there's typically only one best path that a noisy transition will follow from one state to the next,"" Kath said. ""You would think that many different paths are possible, but that's not true: one path is much better than all of the others."" The team then developed a computational approach that can identify optimal modifications of experimentally-adjustable parameters, such as protein activation rates, to encourage desired transitions between different states. The method is ideal for experimental implementations because it changes the system's response to noise rather than changing the noise itself, which is nearly impossible to control. ""Noise is extremely important for systems,"" Wells said. ""Instead of directly controlling a cell to move from a bad state to a good state, which is hard, we just make it easier for noise to do this on its own. This is analogous to paving just one path departing a building and leaving all the others unpaved--people leaving the building are more likely to walk on the paved path, and will thus preferentially end up where that path goes."" Though the current research is theoretical and focuses on biological networks, the team posits that this strategy could be used for other complex networks where noise is present, like in food webs and power grids, and could potentially be used to prevent sudden transitions in these systems, which lead to ecosystem collapses and power grid failures.

01339bc3-7b9e-411d-9c98-352184c5b224,L’Express Montreal,Blog,Tiny Urban Kitchen,"This is the second post in the Montreal Jazz Festival Weekend series. The first post was an overview of our entire trip. I’ve met several Europeans who have told me they are drawn to Boston because it is the city that feels most like home to them. For better or for worse, Boston’s cobblestone roads, abundance of rotaries (or “roundabouts” as they call them in Europe), walkability, and architecture make it one of the most European cities in the U.S. The British influence is clear, and Boston really holds true to its “New England” identify. But what about those Europeans that aren’t British? Drive up 5+ hours north to Montreal, and in many ways, you will feel like you have entered Paris in North America.
French is the official language in Quebec province (which includes Montreal and Quebec City). Rules dictate that commercial signs must be in French, and if another language is added, its font must be smaller. Children must go to French-language schools unless if the parents can show that they themselves had been raised in English-speaking schools. The rules definitely make Montreal feel much more French than other parts of Canada.
For visitors like us, it means we get to experience many elements of France without actually flying across the Atlantic – such as, for example, the abundance of authentic French bistros and cafes.
L’Express is the perfect example of an old-school, authentic, Parisien-style bistro that has been around for 35+ years. The menu consists of French bistro classics, like rillettes, foie gras, croque Monsieur, and fish soup. The environment feels like an old French bistro – everything from the dark wood-paneled walls and the checkered floors to the waiters in black vests.
Each table comes with a huge jar of delicious cornichons (we took our liberties and ate quite a few!) and mustard. Much of the menu stays constant (regular clientele would flip if they removed certain favorites), though there are always specials. To the dismay of Bryan (the only member of our party who studied German instead of French), the specials were only written in French. Thankfully, the waitstaff are quite fluent and they can always help you out. The main menu is pretty standard, with Starters, Main Courses, and Desserts. The restaurant opens at 8AM, so there’s also a separate Breakfast menu. STARTERS
In general, their classic appetizers are great. The Duck Foie Gras Terrine comes with mustard and has a pronounced but not overpowering liver flavor. It’s smooth and goes great with the pile of toast that comes with it.
For those of us sensitive to things that taste too much like liver (ahem, like yours truly), the Rillette L’Express is a better option. It’s still rich and creamy like a pate, but does not have the strong liver flavors you’d find in the foie gras terrine. It’s delicious, and I definitely ate more of that one.
One of our favorites was the Octopus and Lentil Salad ($17.90 CAD), which comes in a dramatic presentation that includes an octopus-leg covered cylinder filled with cooked lentils. The flavors are outstanding, with elements of seafood, aromatic broth, and olives. Definitely order this one!
The Fish Soup, or Soupe de Poissons($13.50 CAD) was also fantastic. A blended soup, it was full of rich, deep seafood-intense flavors. It also came with a phenomenal aioli made from egg yolks, saffron, bread, and garlic. It was fantastic. 
The  Sorrel Soup ($8.55 CAD) was also good, though a bit more unusual and less of a typical crowd-pleaser (unlike the fish soup!). It was herbaceous, slightly tart, and vegetal. It did not have the meaty umami that was so present in the fish soup. We all liked it, but the portion was large and I found that I had a hard time drinking such a large amount of the same, unique flavor. It’s good for sharing, but I personally wouldn’t order it if I had to drink the whole thing myself. MAIN COURSE
French Poached Salmon with Chervil ($25.75 CAD) was cooked perfectly, still rare in middle and super soft. The chervil, or French parsley, came in the form of mashed potatoes, which were super buttery and decadent. Some diners loved the richness of the potatoes while others thought it to be too much.
Bryan was intrigued by the Croque Monsieur, or more simply the “Grilled Cheese and Ham Sandwich” on the English menu. It was good, but not particularly special, so I wouldn’t order it if my goal were to taste the restaurant’s most exceptional dishes. It’s great if that’s what you feel like eating, though – it definitely hits the spot.
The Roasted Quail with Wild Rice ($23.75 CAD) was also very good. The quail was nicely roasted and it came with a sweet wild rice, endive, and peas. I personally thought the sauce was a bit on the sweet side, but I am a bit more sensitive to sweet than most other people.
Bryan ordered the Lobster Risotto, a special of the menu that the server high recommended. Why, oh why, did we order an Italian dish at a French bistro? We were disappointed. Not only was it one of the most expensive entrees, the rice texture was not great (on the mushy side), and the flavors were just ordinary. I’ve had many better lobster risottos in Boston. DESSERTS
Dessert was simple but fun. The French know their chocolate, and these Chocolate Truffles ($1.50 CAD each) were a nice, light way to finish the meal. Yes, we could have opted for some of the traditional French desserts, like Ile Flottante with Caramel ($8.95 CAD), a Chocolate Tart ($8.95 CAD) or the Orange Creme Caramel ($6.50 CAD). Instead,we were full, and we preferred to get one intense dose of chocolate that didn’t full up our stomachs even further. All in all, L’Express is classic French and in general their food is excellent. Definitely get the octopus and lentil salad, the fish soup, and some sort of terrine/pate. Enjoy the cornichons and mustard. Most importantly, take in the environment around you and imagine, just for a moment, that you’re sitting in a bistro in Paris. It’s probably not too far off from the real thing. L’Express Montreal

A little bit ago a friend pointed out something he had forgotten: We live where many Americans want us not to go every day with their kids; especially when we try to get from point A2 down Route 7 on foot if possible! Well no problem here too – there's two major paths throughout American society which lead off straight but stay mostly vertical unless you decide just right… There must be some level 'one' road built around this particular route along Pennsylvania Road 1 between Bedfordshire Avenue S through Lexington Ave.—anyways maybe people might find ways under-looked after seeing how easy routes 515/517 now take depending upon your definition.* No way though–when someone wants him back up more than seven miles away by bus since his parents could only drive five hours so decided going into town instead would probably work wonders against being able keep driving long distances without having everyone else rush over.(1)"

Unfortunately, nothing else is different here compared to the last gen iPhone 6, so it’s possible that Apple won’t make any massive design changes compared to the predecessors. This isn’t exactly a surprise given what we’ve seen in the past. However, Apple introduced the Touch ID fingerprint sensor with the iPhone 5s, while the iPhone 5 didn’t have it. Perhaps the Force Touch sensor here will serve to be a similar upgrade.

237d7225-ebda-4a00-8a8d-97a0b9b3041b,David De Gea's move to Real Madrid off as paperwork late,News,Zambia Post,"David De Gea's £29m move from Manchester United to Real Madrid has collapsed because the necessary paperwork was not submitted in time. 
 
No official announcement has yet been made by either club. 
 
As part of the deal to sell De Gea to Real, United were planning to bring Keylor Navas in the opposite direction. 
 
There is no precedent for Spanish clubs being given additional time to conclude transfers as there is in England. 
 
Blame for the failure to complete the deal is already being apportioned. 
 Who says what?  
Reports in Spain claim United were responsible for the deal collapsing. 
 
The line is that they did not get their paperwork to Spanish Football Federation headquarters until a minute after the 23:00 BST deadline. 
 
In their defence, United say they have a receipt that proves they submitted the relevant documents in time. 
 
It remains to be seen whether Real will appeal to world governing body Fifa, who are responsible for sanctioning international transfers. 
 What now for De Gea?  
Well, if Real Madrid don't appeal, or they do appeal and fail to push the transfer through, then he'll be back at Old Trafford competing for a place in the United starting line-up. 
 
He'll be up against Sergio Romero, the Argentina number one, and Victor Valdes, who, like De Gea, was linked with other clubs but stayed. 
 
First, though, De Gea, who has not played for United this season, must turn his attentions to international duty with Spain. 
 
They have two Euro 2016 qualifying matches to negotiate, at home to Slovakia on 5 September and in Macedonia on 8 September. 
 What about United?  
They seem pretty relaxed about it all. 
 
If De Gea ends up staying, then they have a world-class keeper to call on. If he goes, then the Navas deal could still happen. 
 
Unlike Real Madrid, United have a few more hours to get stuff done. 
 
The transfer window may be shut in Spain, but it remains open until 18:00 BST on Tuesday for Premier League clubs. 
 What else have they been up to?  
Monday was mostly about letting players leave... 
 Mexico striker Javier Hernandez  joined Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen  for £7.3m  Belgium winger Adnan Januzaj also moved to Germany, agreeing a season-long loan with Borussia Dortmund  Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard joined West Bromwich Albion on a two-year deal  And centre-half Tyler Blackett agreed a season-long loan deal with Scottish giants Celtic  
But the move that caught a lot of people by surprise involved a French teenager by the name of Anthony Martial. 
 
It appears United are willing to pay as much as £36m to get him. 
 Who is he?  
A striker with Monaco. He's only 19, but he's got bags of potential. He's even been likened to Thierry Henry. 
 
Nevertheless, £36m is a lot to pay for a youngster. 
 
According to French football journalist Philippe Auclair, the size of the transfer fee has left ""people speechless in France"". 
 
""He's got good technique, good skills, he's a good finisher, but he is still a raw product,"" added Auclair. ""We don't know how far he can go.""",514,"David De Gea's £29m move from Manchester United to Real Madrid has collapsed because the necessary paperwork was not submitted in time.

3a0feb96-2ea2-4a56-9a0e-736a92fdf5a1,Equity market moves signal little about the economy,News,Edge Markets,"SINGAPORE: The recent moves of the Chinese equity market provoked a flurry of questions directed at economists. Underlying these questions was an assumption that equity markets are in some way intimately linked with the workings of economies. This is not so. In fact, for economists, equity markets are something of a sideshow. 
 
It is worth emphasising that rising equities are not always a good thing. Suggesting equities had a “good” day if they rose and a “bad” day if they fell does not make economic sense. Equities have a good day if they are fairly valued according to economic fundamentals. Equities have a bad day if they are deviating from fair value. An equity market that is bubbling ever higher is not “good”. An equity market that, having overheated, corrects down to fair value is not “bad”. Nonetheless the Orwellian simplicity of “up=good, down=bad” has become so entrenched that even policymakers can be sucked into this. 
 
It is common for policymakers to try to limit “short selling” — the sale of equity one does not own in expectation of a fall in the price. However, it is relatively rare for there to be a ban on using credit to purchase equities in the hope of a rise in the price. The latter is actually a short selling of cash (one is handing over cash one does not own in exchange for equity), but this is considered acceptable. The false idea that “down=bad” justifies a policy that prevents selling on credit but does not prevent buying on credit. 
 
For economists, a fall in equity markets correcting from a bubble tells us no more about the economic outlook than did the inflated expectations that preceded it. 
 
The relationship between equities and economies is limited. Generally speaking, large companies account for around 40% of private sector activity in an economy, and maybe 30% of private employment. Most business is carried out by small businesses in a modern economy, and the government sector is also important. In developed economies, companies quoted on the equity market will account for maybe a quarter of total economic activity and a fifth of total employment. 
 
The last two recessions in the G7 economies are a good study of the consequences of this. The most recent recession in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 was essentially a small-business recession. Large businesses suffered too, but the policy responses have generally helped large businesses a lot more rapidly than they have aided small businesses. However, the 2001 recession (which, depending on how one wants to define recession, may not have been a recession at all) was primarily a problem for larger companies. Smaller businesses fared relatively better in that economic downturn. Judging the world entirely on the basis of large corporate performance would have given a distorted view of economic performance this century. 
 
Moreover, the relationship between equity markets and their local economy has become ever more stretched as economic activity has become ever more globalised. Large listed companies are increasingly transnational — that is to say a large proportion (often a majority) of their earnings comes from overseas sales, and often a large part of their operations and thus costs are incurred overseas. Which equity market these companies are listed on is often little more than an accident of history. This means that the relationship between equities and individual economies is frayed further. One could make a case that equity markets signal something about a proportion of global economic activity, but to ascribe equity performance to domestic economic activity is dangerous. 
 
So, is there anything equities can tell economists? There are certainly links. Equities are an asset, and as such contribute to household wealth and have a bearing on financial stability. Wealth effects are important to consumer spending, and thus to economics. Loss aversion is a powerful force for consumers; people dislike losses more than they like profits, so if equities go from 100 to 200 then back to 100, equity holders will be more negative about life at the end of the process than they were at the start. This has some relevance to China’s recent volatility — equities are higher than they were at the start of the year but that does not mean there will not be a negative reaction to what has happened to date. 
 
Equity markets should not therefore be ignored, but they need to be seen in their proper context. Equities represent a sub-section of any economy, and they are likely to be influenced by global forces as much as domestic forces. Equities have a bearing on economics, through the wealth effect. Beyond that, there are better indicators to watch as a guide to economic performance.

a0e03818-4448-48b3-b9ce-732bf8d4e52e,A Secure Future,News,One Place.com,"Suppose you made a million dollars per year. Would that set you up for life? Would it give you financial security for the future? Well, apparently not if you’re a professional athlete. According to a report in Investment News , 78 percent of NFL players are bankrupt or under financial stress within two years of retirement. Sports Illustrated similarly reports that 60 percent of NBA players are in serious financial trouble within five years of retirement. [1] 
 
Today we know it’s not enough to have a job that simply takes care of today’s needs, but that somehow we need to manage wisely for the future. In ancient Egypt, Joseph wisely stored up grain for the coming days of famine. In Proverbs 31, the wise woman was a hard-working manager who provided for her family and wasn’t worried about winter. She prepared for the coming seasons in advance. Jesus commended the shrewd steward in Luke 16 for using his current position to insure a secure future. 
 
Nothing Can Pry Us From His Hand 
 
            As Christians, even though we should plan for our future, we don’t rely on the world for our ultimate security. For us, the eternal God is our refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. We have a hope that endures; for when Jesus comes into our lives, He comes with abiding security that is unlike any security we can find on earth. He not only died to forgive our sins; He rose from the dead to give us eternal life. His resurrection supplies the power, provision, and pattern for our own resurrections. Because He lives, we will live also. 
 
John’s Gospel drives this home. At the end of his Gospel, John stated his purpose in writing—that we might believe in Christ and have eternal life (John 20:31). He similarly ended his little letter of 1 John by telling us he had written it that we might know we have eternal life (1 John 5:13). Throughout his writing, John used the phrases “eternal life” and “everlasting life” twenty-three times. For example, Jesus told us in John 10:26-29: “My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.” 
 
            The future just doesn’t get any more secure than that! 
 
Nothing Can Separate Us From His Love 
 
            Not only can nothing snatch us from His hand; nothing can separate us from His love. The apostle Paul declared: “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?” He went on to say, “I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Romans 8:35, 38-39). He was convinced and no one could tell him otherwise. 
 
Nothing Can Alter His Plan 
 
            The Bible also teaches that nothing can alter God’s plan. Ecclesiastes 3:14 says, “I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God does it that men should fear before Him.” 
 
            Our Lord is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is immutable—unchanged, unchanging, and unchangeable. His grace doesn’t fluctuate. His power doesn’t ebb and flow. His love and mercy do not rise and fall with the tides of any cosmic ocean. He is steadfast, constant, and enduring. The Bible says, “The Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting; and His truth endures to all generations” (Psalm 100:5). 
 
            What security and hope! What a basis for an optimistic attitude, even during painful times. And how wonderful to know we don’t have to fear the future or worry about our security. 
 
            When the world experiences the ebb and flow of change, remember: Nothing can separate us from His love. No one can snatch us from His hand. Nothing can alter His plan. We are secure. Start enjoying your eternal life today!

39820edb-a87a-4966-b3b4-eccf9cd8e0e6,Amended plans for gasification plant in Corby approved by county council,News,Northamptonshire Telegraph,"Revised plans for a new gasification plant in Corby have been approved despite more than 80 objections. 

		 
Clean Power Properties Ltd already had planning permission to build an advanced conversion technology and anaerobic digestion facility in Shelton Road on the Willowbrook East industrial estate in Corby. 
  This comes down to common sense 
 Lee Forster  
 
It then secured the go-ahead to amend the approved catchment area earlier this year and today (Tueday) it has been allowed to vary and delete some of the conditions included in the original scheme. 

			 
The key amendments to the consented scheme are the energy recovery centre remains an advanced conversion technology facility but the nature of the technology is being changed from pyrolysis to gasification, it will treat predominantly pre-prepared fuels that have already been subject to a treatment process off-site, the facility will not treat food waste and the anaerobic digestion element of the scheme is omitted. 



 
To accommodate the revised technology, the scale of the proposed building has had to increase but the proposal should generate less heavy goods vehicle trips than the previous scheme. 

The revised plans were drawn up to accommodate the needs of the operator, who was not confirmed at the time of the original application. 

Those plans attracted a lot of opposition, and this latest stage also split opinion. 

Corby Council raised concerns about the way in which the proposed changes have been assessed, and said it has contacted the Secretary of State asking for the application to be called in. 

			 
Gretton Parish Council objected to the plans for several reasons, including a potential increase in emissions and the effect on air quality, fire risk and the variation of the catchment area which it had previously objected to. 

Concerns over waste being transported across county borders and additional lorries causing traffic issues and pollution were raised by Weldon Parish Council. 

Ward councillor for Weldon and Gretton Rob McKellar spoke at today’s meeting of Northamptonshire County Council’s development control committee, which was considering the application. 

He said he had been contacted by a large number of people who have ‘real’ concerns about the plans. 

			 
Cllr McKellar also read out a statement from MP for Corby and East Northants Tom Pursglove, which said he was strongly opposed to the application. 

One objector who addressed councillors at the meeting said: “What’s lovely about Northamptonshire is it has woodland and has real treasures and that doesn’t always equate to money. 

“It equates to being healthy and well and these are the things that are being jeopardised by the ill thought-out waste management plan.” 

Another objector Lee Forster spoke and he said: “This comes down to common sense. 

“More research needs to be done into the companies bringing this technology to our towns.” 

			 
And he added: “I am urging you to do the right thing today, throw out the application and let peace remain in the Shire.” 

A representative speaking on behalf of the applicant said the plans would create 150 jobs during the construction stage and 34 full-time jobs when it is operational. 

She said the proposed changes were to meet the requirements of the operator and that the change in technology meant an increase in the size of the facility. 

As councillors discussed the application, there was praise for the people of Corby for making their views known, but it was also noted that there were no planning grounds on which to refuse it. 

Following a vote, the committee went with the planning officer’s recommendation to approve the application. 

Committee chairman Ian Morris said it was a ‘tricky’ one but their hands were tied.",601,Revised plans for a new gasification plant in Corby have been approved despite more than 80 objections.

TEL AVIV — In an attempt to assuage Israeli concerns about Moscow’s military 
buildup in Syria, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday told visiting 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the Syrian Army is in no 
position to threaten the Jewish state. 

“We know that the Syrian Army is in a situation where it is unable to open a 
new front. Our main purpose is to defend the Syrian state,” Putin told 
Netanyahu prior to heading into extensive talks on implications of the 
Russian buildup at Israel’s north. 

According to a transcript released by Netanyahu’s office, Putin said he 
understood the Israeli leader's concerns and was “very happy you came to 
discuss every issue in detail.” 

In his opening remarks, Netanyahu — accompanied by the Israel Defense Forces 
(IDF) chief of staff and head of Israeli military intelligence — expressed 
concern that Iran and Syria are arming Lebanese-based Hezbollah with the 
purpose of opening a new front against Israel from the Syrian side of the 
Golan Heights. 

He reiterated Israel’s policy of responding to attacks emanating from Syrian 
soil and preventing transfers of advanced weapons from reaching the hands of 
Lebanese Shiite forces fighting alongside Iran in support of the 
Moscow-backed Assad regime. 

“As you know, in recent years, and especially in the past months, Iran and 
Syria are arming an extreme Islamic terror organization, Hezbollah, with 
advanced weaponry,” Netanyahu said. 

Hezbollah, Netanyahu noted, “has already fired upon us over the years 
thousands of missiles and rockets against our cities.” 

As for Iran, an increasingly close ally of Moscow that trains, funds and 
equips Hezbollah as a forward front against Israel, Netanyahu said the 
Islamic Republic, “under the protection of the Syrian Army, is trying to 
build a second terror front against us in the Golan.” 

“Our policy is to thwart transfers of these weapons and to prevent creation 
of a terror front against us from the Golan territory,” he said. 

Putin, according to the Israeli readout of opening remarks, condemned 
shelling and mortar attacks on Israel from Syrian soil, which he said were 
carried out by “home networks.” 

The Russian leader told his guest, “Every action of Russia in the region has 
always been very responsible.” 

He highlighted the many emigrants from the former Soviet Union now living in 
Israel as having “special significance” on the bilateral relationship.

d48cbbdf-83d1-4c48-a548-7a2b5dc77b0d,Health: Can bacteria spray replace showers?,News,KCTV 5,"BOSTON, MA (WBZ/CNN) - Forget the soap and bath gels - a Massachusetts company says spraying live bacteria on your skin is al you need to keep clean.

“I have not taken a shower in over 12 years,” said Dave Whitlock, a chemical engineer and MIT grad. And he said he doesn’t miss bathing at all.

“No one did clinical trials on people taking showers every day, so what’s the basis for assuming that that is a healthy practice?” he said.

What Whitlock does believe is healthy is restoring good bacteria to our skin, which our ancestors enjoyed long ago and which has slowly been stripped away by excessive cleaning. To prove his theory, he helped found Aobiome, a company based in Cambridge, MA.

Jasmina Aganovic is also an MIT grad who says as humans, we need to reconnect with our environment.

“We’ve confused clean with sterile,” Aganovic said. “We’ve taken the dirt out of our lives. We don’t spend as much time outdoors as we used to -- even little children.”

To add a little dirt back into our lives, Aobiome has created Mother Dirt, specifically the AO+ mist containing live bacteria that is sprayed directly on the skin twice a day.

The formula has no scent.

“Our users are able to reduce their dependence on conventional products -- examples include cutting out or cutting down on deodorant, cutting out or cutting down on moisturizers,” Aganovic said.

There’s a Mother Dirt shampoo and cleanser that don’t contain bacteria, but Aganovic said they won’t interfere with it, either.

And while Whitlock still doesn’t shower, he does use Mother Dirt every day and hopes he rest of the world will join him.

“I would like a billion people a day to use this,” he said.

While Aobiome believes in the health benefits of these live bacteria, they’re not making any scientific claims right now, but soon they will begin clinical trials on inflammatory skin conditions, like acne.",326,"BOSTON, MA (WBZ/CNN) - Forget the soap and bath gels - a Massachusetts company says spraying live bacteria on your skin is al you need to keep clean. “I have not taken a shower in over 12 years,” said Dave Whitlock, a chemical engineer and MIT grad.

I drink up every moment. Justin and I often try to get Evelyn duty at night. We switch between the 3 kids in the large bedroom and baby duty. Lately, she started whispering along while I sing Primary songs. It makes me smile in the dark as I hold her little toddler body until her limbs start twitching from sleep.
She is turning into a toddler...for sure. She is quite opinionated! Her favorite things are akles (apple sauce packets), iTad (iPad), Duddies (Bubble Guppies show), going totty (sitting on the potty for an M&M), her well-loved ellie binky (she dug a hole in one arm, pulled out the stuffing and puts her finger in the hole when she is tired), Vader, Daddy, Mommy, Amelia, Phillip, Everett, Ella, her babies, and chips. I think that pretty much sums up her world right now. She does love to sing. Her favorite songs to sing are Let it Go, ABCs, Wheels on the Bus, Itsy Bitsy Spider, Sunbeam, Popcorn, EIEIO, and Twinkle Star. When this girl gets in the water she turns into a mermaid. Never seen a kid take to the water quite like she does...she wants to swim, without a floating device. She can make a silly face and screech like a banshee. When outside she drags her babies and stroller to mosey around the block. She stops to admire the bugs, pet all the dogs, pull pretty flowers up, and throw rocks. It is very exciting. Evelyn is quite the climber and loves to slide. She learned how to climb up on counters, beds (Amelia's bunk bed) and onto the bookcase. Shades of Phillip right there!
Evelyn is not too keen on using words at the time. She has too many folks who talk for her. She is slowly learning to say words. At times she busts out a sentence, like ""I want shoes!"" Much to our amusement. Her favorite words are: no, yes, daddy, mommy, akle, binky, shoes, socks, off, totty, stop, up, mark get set go, share, 1-2-3, juice, water, cereal, cheese, chips, and candy. This kid is stellar. Can't wait to see what this year brings! Hoping for potty training success, fuller vocabulary, more independence, better sleeping habits, and learning to share. At her well-child she measured 32 inches tall, or in the 11th percentile for height. She weighed in at 23 lbs, in the 7th percentile for height.

Protests are widespread in Sydney. Most schools ignore them.

It's easy to blame police.

It's not often I'm told to, ""Woman up!""

As an outspoken feminist – in the media, and our lounge room – I talk often about how words, and actions, matter.

We're a fair way from the road when this phrase is uttered. To be precise, we are smack bang in the middle of towering eucalypts near one of Victoria's highest waterfalls.

Steavenson Falls cascades over 122 metres, through dense forest filled with Mountain Ash, Myrtle Beech and Silver Wattle.The area around Marysville is regenerating remarkably since the 2009 bushfires but signs remain: a charred log here, a blackened trunk there.

The regeneration includes the ultra-modern Vibe Hotel on the site of the old Cumberland Guest House.The previous day, we'd visited eccentric artist Bruno Torfs, whose Art & Sculpture Garden was all but obliterated by the flames.

Like the phoenix it is renewed, along with Bruno's humour. He shows the kids a painting, the ""Mona Lisa"", before pulling a panel to make the eyes move. He then transported us on a mystical tour of mythological creatures hidden amongst the Hardenbergias. These plants are, appropriately, known as Happy Wanderers. This is how we feel, meandering around a town reborn.

The kids use eyedroppers to feed endangered birds at the nearby Healesville Sanctuary. But the highlight is the Spirit of the Sky show, complete with a talking Corella called Kevin.

At first, I'm concerned Kevin will parrot one of the phrases of his political namesake: ""I'm here to help"", or ""Fair shake of the sauce bottle"". Then, I worry he'll be like my grandfather's cockatoo, who'd learnt from his original owner, ""Shut up woman, and get me a beer""! Fortunately, Kevin's chatter is G-rated.

This celebration of avian life is followed by a commemoration of piscine death. (It's important to teach kids about the cycle of life, right?). You can stay all day at the Buxton Trout and Salmon Farm, hooking a beauty and cooking it up for the family.

""Yikes, that's brutal,"" nine-year-old Grace whispers as our guide, Tegan, whacks her rainbow trout on the head. ""It's not cruel, actually,"" Tegan explains. ""A quick kill puts the fish out of its misery.""

Which brings me back to bushwalking, where I'm hoping to be put out of my admittedly-not-potentially-fatal misery.

Now I don't know about you, but the sound of rushing water makes me want to do one thing.

I'd failed to 'go' at the toilet block next to Steavenson Falls. According to the kids, I was whingeing all the way back to the car.

""Mum, just go in the bushes, no one will see you!"" Grace exhorts, repeating what I'd told her many times before.

""Well, someone else might come along the path and, I don't want to get my shoes wet, and there's a steep drop off the edge and, and, and ...""

""For goodness sake, Mum. Woman up!"" Taj yells.

On our path towards non-gender-specific language in the house, I had banned the term ""Man up"".

Thinking it would be insulting to imply I'm not as a tough as a man, Taj is gently, but firmly, telling me to piss in the bush.

So I do.

No one watches, and my shoes remain dry: success in anyone's language.

We leave with my dignity, and sense of humour, intact.

Morgan was initially not expected to play again this season after suffering an ankle injury against the Warriors in round 24.

But the Queensland utility is expected to be fit for the match with Broncos at Suncorp Stadium, in a huge boost to the Cowboys hopes of claiming their first premiership.

Cowboys coach Paul Green was quietly confident about the return of Morgan.

""I hope so, he's done a little bit of running,"" Green said.

""But again, we're guaranteed - win, lose or draw - a second week in the finals, so we're not going to take any unnecessary risks.

""I don't need to say how good Morgo's been at different times for us this year.

""We'll welcome him back if he's fit.""

Broncos halfback Ben Hunt is also expected to return after missing Brisbane's last-start loss to Melbourne with a quad injury.

For South Sydney, skipper Greg Inglis is likely to be back for the Rabbitohs' elimination final.

The superstar fullback missed the last two games of the regular season after undergoing knee surgery.

Cronulla star Andrew Fifita's club-imposed suspension ends in week one of the finals but he isn't certain to return for the Sharks' elimination final after picking up a lower leg injury at training during the week.

St George Illawarra playmaker Gareth Widdop is only a 50-50 chance of returning for the Dragons' elimination final after missing the last round win over Wests Tigers.

We asked real moms , ""What's the most ridiculous thing your partner said in the delivery room?"" and some (if not most!) of the comments had us wondering how these dads ever made it out of the hospital alive.

caeba5e6-79dd-4beb-8766-e86392211ff7,UPDATE: Man seriously injured after seven-car smash,News,Lancashire Evening Telegraph,"A MAN was airlifted to hospital following a car crash which left seven vehicles badly damaged. 
 
The man, who was a passenger in a black Honda Civic, was airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital by the North West Air Ambulance. 
 
He is understood to have suffered serious injuries in the incident, which closed Hibson Road, Nelson for more than six hours. 
 
 MORE TOP STORIES:  
 
It is thought the Honda and a white Mercedes C63 collided with a silver Volkswagen Touran and two other cars before crashing into two parked cars. The Honda came to a stop after hitting a wall. 
 
The other vehicles involved were a Seat Leon, a Renault Megane, a BMW 335 and an Audi Q7. 
 
The man was initially treated at the roadside by firefighters until paramedics arrived and the decision was taken to airlift him. 
 
Two other men in the car, whose identities have also not been released, were taken to Royal Preston Hospital by ambulance. 
 
Police said yesterday that none of the injuries were thought to be life-threatening. 
 
Enquiries are on-going to trace the driver of the Mercedes who made off from the scene. 
 
PC Mark Newton of the Road Policing Unit said: “This was a major collision involving a number of vehicles and it is lucky that no one was more seriously injured. An investigation into how this collision occurred is underway and I would appeal to anyone who witnessed what happened to contact us as soon as possible. 
   Promoted stories   
“We are also keen to hear from anyone who may have seen any of the vehicles involved driving prior to the collision and anyone with any information should contact us on 101.” 
 
Following the crash calls have been made for traffic calming measures to be introduced in the area. 
 
The road is in a 30mph zone but cars are often parked along its route, which has several bends and is on a steep gradient. 
 
Pendle Councillor Naeem Hussain Ashraf said: “It’s lucky nobody has died. That is a really dangerous bend and something needs to be done. Traffic calming measures need to be put in place because next time somebody could die.” 
 
Pendle Council leader Cllr Mohammed Iqbal added that motorists needed to drive in an appropriate way for the road conditions and he would be interested in the results of the accident investigation into the cause of the crash. 
 
Insp Kevin Otter, of Lancashire Police, said no arrests have been made but police ‘know who the drivers are and would be speaking to them at a later date to establish the circumstances of the crash’. 
 
Firefighters from Nelson, police and paramedics attended the crash site at 4.10pm. 
 
Nobody needed freeing from any of the vehicles, but residents came out of their houses to offer their help and could be seen comforting the men. 
 
A spokeswoman from the North West Air Ambulance Service confirmed it had attended the scene and airlifted a man to Wythenshawe Hospital.

The new iPhones will go on sale on Sept. 25, with advance orders starting this Saturday. 

That's a week later than Apple's typical playbook. Usually, new iPhones go on sale on the second Friday after their announcements. 

Consistent with past models, the iPhone 6s will start at $200 with a two-year service contract. The iPhone 6s Plus will start at $300 with a contract. Last year's models will cost $100 less. 

The markets getting it right away are the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the U.K. 

The base models of the new iPhones will come with 16 gigabytes of storage, even as Samsung and other phone makers are now offering 32 gigabytes to start. 

But for $100 more, Apple is offering 64 gigabytes. For an extra $200 over the base prices, Apple is offering 128 gigabytes.

                            On Monday, as Conservative Leader Stephen Harper spoke about his party's plan to encourage home ownership, a massive Home Hardware logo loomed behind him where a Canadian flag usually stands. 
 

                            As a result, the Ontario-based hardware retailer got a solid 10 minutes of free advertising. Isn't that benefit the equivalent of a campaign expense that ought to be declared to the authorities? 
 

                            Not according to Elections Canada. 
 

                            ""While the treatment may differ based on the facts of a given situation, to date the provision of a forum to serve as a backdrop for a campaign announcement has not been considered a political contribution on the assumption that it has no commercial value,"" said spokesman Serge Fleyfel. 
 

                            When a company provides a location, however, the party has to pick up the tab for any additional costs that are incurred as a result, Fleyfel added. 
 

                            ""Any incremental costs incurred in providing the venue would have to be paid by the party; otherwise, this would be an ineligible non-monetary contribution to the party."" 
 

                            Ineligible because corporations are banned from donating to political campaigns thanks to rules brought in by the Conservatives in 2006. 
 

                            But that doesn't mean there aren't grey areas, said Duff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch and a visiting professor at the University of Ottawa.  
 

                            Calculating those incremental costs is one of them. 
 

                            ""What's the value of a space that is never rented out to anybody?"" Conacher asked in an interview. 
 

                            The agency does not regularly audit expense claims to suss out whether parties are actually declaring the true value of the space they rent or the added costs they are covering, he added. 
 

                            Automotive supply firm Spencer ARL said the NDP didn't pay them anything to allow Tom Mulcair to appear at their facility in Niagara Falls, Ont., earlier this month. 
 

                            Mulcair took a tour of the company before making a speech, but plant manager Daryn Bryne said operations weren't disrupted and it didn't cost them anything. 
 

                            ""We were open to a visit,"" he said. ""It was as simple as that."" 
 

                            Dave Hill's company, LamSar Industrial Contractors in Sarnia, Ont., hosted Harper over the weekend. He said the party did pay for the space, though not much was disrupted as it was a Sunday event. 
 

                            He said he saw hosting as a chance to help out the local Conservative candidate, who he knows because they do business together, as opposed to endorsing the party, despite what the optics might suggest. 
 

                            ""I can't speak for everybody that works for my company, I can only speak for myself,"" Hill said. ""I'm very reluctant to endorse anybody."" 
 

                            For its part, Home Hardware said Harper's appearance was not an endorsement by their company either. 
 

                            ""As a national retail organization, we don't support any one party,"" spokesman Rob Wallace said in an email. 
 

                            The increased presence of corporate logos on the campaign trail is just another example of a change in political marketing altogether, said Jonathan Rose, an associate professor of political science at Queens University in Kingston, Ont. 
 

                            ""It really is a natural extension of political party as brand.... The cliched picture of the leader serving coffee at Tim's is the best example of this: it communicates a ideal of everyman,"" he said. 
 

                            ""What it tells us that parties are becoming increasingly a vehicle for marketing a brand and less a means to communicate a constellation of ideas.""

0be56d62-3772-4cc0-bc1f-fd24230a736d,FedEx bids for TNT - market control or fair play?,Blog,Transglobal Express Blog,"Last month, delivery titan FedEx made a bid to acquire rival company TNT, with an offer of $4.8 billion. As a result, the European Commission launched an investigation to determine if FedEx would violate regulations by dominating the market—specifically, the delivery of small packages in some European countries.
So why does FedEx's domination of the European market matter to the Commission?
Healthy competition The principle behind the regulations of the European Commission is one of healthy competition. FedEx and TNT are two of four giant global delivery companies—the other two are UPS and DHL. If FedEx acquire TNT, the concern is that they will become too powerful and risk controlling too much of the market.
In 2012, UPS made a similar bid, attempting to purchase TNT for $6.8 billion. Antitrust regulators rebuffed this attempt because it risked ‘duopoly'. This is because at the time DHL was considered the only viable competition.
Is it really an issue? FedEx insists that it's not the same situation as last time. They say they don't have a large market share in Europe, and therefore they won't disrupt market dynamics with the acquisition. Currently their market share in Europe is only 5%, one of the smallest, while TNT's is third place with 12%, after DHL and UPS. If the deal is made, the FedEx-TNT merger would put them in second place.
Some industry experts, such as Roger Sumner-Rivers of ParcelHero, who spoke to Forbes, believe that the merger will actually result in stronger competition in Europe and around the globe. The idea is that as TNT will make up for FedEx's weakness in Europe, while FedEx will bolster TNT's less strong American network.
This is different from the proposed UPS-TNT merger, where UPS already had a strong European presence and would have bagged 30% of the market.
To be continued... FedEx's offer expires at the end of October. Pending regulatory approval, the transaction would be made in the first half of 2016. The EU will make their decision by mid-January—an extension of the original timescale.
We'll be keeping up with news of the merger. To stay apprised, you can follow industry updates on the Transglobal website.

97d1a198-e20e-4c20-a7a0-17b136fccbc0,"T-Mobile CEO guarantees better coverage with iPhone 6S, 6 Plus",Blog,CNET News,"T-Mobile CEO guarantees better coverage with iPhone 6S, 6 Plus Carrier is shaking things up again with program that lets customers using latest smartphones easily cancel their T-Mobile service if they can't get a signal wherever they are. by Marguerite Reardon @maggie_reardon September 10, 2015 6:14 PM PDT T-Mobile CEO John Legere guarantees improved network coverage for customers with the latest iPhones. CNET T-Mobile is telling Apple fans their new iPhone 6S or 6S Plus will get better 4G coverage than ever on the carrier's network. Guaranteed.
The company is so confident people using the latest smartphones will be pleased with its network, it's announced a program that lets customers painlessly cancel service if unsatisfied. Apple's just-unveiled iPhones, along with other new devices such as Samsung's Galaxy S6, include support for radio frequencies that T-Mobile now uses on its 4G LTE network. These low-band frequencies extend the carrier's signal over greater distances and improve in-building coverage. So the company is convinced its customers will no longer be plagued by slow or spotty 4G service, and it's offering a Lifetime Coverage Guarantee for as long as they use these new phones on its network. The offer is a signal to the wireless industry that the carrier's network is finally on par with those of rivals AT&T and Verizon, in terms of both download speeds and coverage. For more than two years, T-Mobile has been shaking up the industry, offering no-interest device financing, early upgrade programs and free international data, and eliminating service contracts.
But the company has had one big weakness compared with its two largest competitors: Its network. T-Mobile has worked quickly to close the gap, and Apple's 6S and 6S Plus are the first iPhones that can take advantage of the carrier's upgraded 4G LTE network. ""If you haven't tried our network lately,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a blog post Thursday, ""you seriously haven't tried it."" Legere said Apple's latest iPhones can tap into T-Mobile's upgrades and offer customers ""a totally new experience with iPhone 6S and 6S Plus on T-Mobile.""
T-Mobile has expanded the reach of its network using low-frequency spectrum. T-Mobile T-Mobile promises that if at any time within 30 days of signing up a customer decides to go to another carrier, it will reimburse them for any service costs already generated and completely refund the phone price. After the 30-day window, it will unlock the customer's phone so it can be used with another carrier, while still letting that person pay off the device in no-interest monthly installments, and refunding that current month's service costs. Legere said the deal is an extension of T-Mobile's Test Drive program, which lets customers try a new device for a week before signing up for service. The new deal is an improvement over the standard 14-day return policy offered by T-Mobile and other carriers. It also eliminates a restocking fee for a returned device. The program is available to new or existing Simple Choice customers who sign up for the Jump On Demand early upgrade program. Eligible devices are those that support what T-Mobile calls ""Extended Range LTE,"" a fancy marketing term for the 700MHz frequency on LTE Band 12. Simply put, such devices can take advantage of the low-frequency spectrum T-Mobile used to build its 4G LTE network. The new iPhones are the first Apple handsets to support LTE Band 12, but the new Samsung Galaxy S6 and the latest Galaxy Note also support it, and it's likely any devices hitting the market from now on will do so too. Traditionally, T-Mobile has lacked the type of low-frequency spectrum, or licensed radio airwaves, that can carry signals over longer distances and penetrate through obstacles more easily. Instead, it's built much of its 3G and 4G data networks using higher-frequency spectrum that offers more capacity over shorter distances. Thus its coverage has largely been limited to dense urban markets, and its signals have been weak or nonexistent indoors for some customers.
Since its failed merger with AT&T in 2011, T-Mobile has been acquiring low-frequency spectrum and using it to extend the reach of its wireless network. ""We have been rolling out truckloads of new spectrum that carries our LTE signal twice as far from our towers, for a massive coverage expansion, and that works four times better in buildings,"" Legere said in his blog post. He said the new spectrum is available in 170 markets and covers more than half the US population. Legere said T-Mobile will cover more than 350 markets within three months.

For Star Wars fans travelling between Japan and the US, Europe, Australia and Asia this fall, here are the numbers and the date to note: On October 18, the R2-D2 ANA jet will begin service on international routes, beginning with flight NH116, between Tokyo’s Haneda airport and Vancouver. 

For Star Wars fans travelling between Japan and the US, Europe, Australia and Asia this fall, here are the numbers and the date to note. 
 
The aircraft - a Dreamliner 787-9 - will then expand to other routes that include Tokyo to Seattle, San Jose, Paris, Brussels, Munich, Sydney, Beijing and Jakarta. 

In addition to blasting off into, albeit, subspace, on an R2-D2 jet, passengers will live out a uniquely Star Wars experience aboard the aircraft, which will be decked out nose to tail in themed decorations, from headrest covers, paper napkins, cups, and in-flight entertainment. 

In fact, for the first time, all six Star Wars films will be available on board. 

Over the weekend, the newly painted R2-D2 jet made its first public appearance in Seattle, rolling out of the hangar to the Star Wars soundtrack, accompanied by a small army of protective Stormtroopers. 

Two additional planes decorated with BB-8, a new character from the upcoming ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" film due out in December, and a Star Wars-themed plane featuring characters on either side of the fuselage, will also enter service. 

The BB-8 jet is scheduled to launch in spring, serving international routes primarily between Japan and North America, while the Star Wars jet will take to the skies in November, flying domestic routes within Japan. 

Though ANA’s partnership with Disney’s Star Wars franchise may go down in the books as one of the most epic, it’s definitely not the first collaboration of its kind. 

Air New Zealand has served as the official carrier for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, emblazoning their aircraft with hobbits, heroes and dragons, while Taiwanese airline Eva has Hello Kitty aircraft in circulation around the world.

To adhere the map to the back of the cabinet I first coated the red chalky paint in a sealant spray so that it wouldn''t show through onto the wrapping paper. This paper is more like thick calendar paper, not the thin wrapping paper that comes in rolls.

Ashley Love, 26, attempted to rob the innocent 21-year-old in Gravesend while holding the tool. 
 
Love, formerly of Ebbsfleet Walk in Northfleet, saw the victim walking down Stanbrook Road and demanded money. 
 

 
The victim ran away but as he did so, his mobile phone fell out of his pocket.  
 
Love initially told the victim he would keep the device but then chased after him and returned it before they went their separate ways. 
 
While the robbery bid was taking place, police were already making their way to the scene after receiving reports of a man hitting a wall with a hammer. 
 

 
But while en route, they were stopped by the victim who told them what had happened. 
 
Love was on licence when the offences were committed and pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and possessing an offensive weapon at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday. 
 
After sentencing, PC Hollie Brown said: ""Love's offences are violent and destructive and their severity cannot be understated. 
 
""I firmly believe that had he not received this sentence he would have continued to be a threat to the public and hope he thinks about the damage his actions cause to the victims while he is in prison.""",223,"A hammer-wielding thug who threatened a stranger in the street and demanded cash has been locked up for three years and four months.

80e59a9f-e9ef-476d-a0f2-9c2158add980,Effectively Growing Your Digital Marketing,Blog,CompuKol Connection » Blog,"In the past, if you owned a small, or even medium-size, business, you may have been able to get away with very little marketing. Well those days are gone. Not only do you need to market nowadays (no matter what size business you own) but you need to be involved in many different types of marketing. They are all a part of your marketing strategy. 
 

 The changing approach to marketing for your business  
In days gone by, the marketing approach that business owners used was outbound marketing. With outbound marketing, the advertiser placed ads in various places (print ads, television, radio, etc). Although that marketing approach worked for a long time, eventually, the target audience got smart and learned how to block the ads in various ways. Of course, that left the business owners with a really big problem. 
 
A newer (and probably more effective approach in this digital technology age) is inbound marketing. Inbound marketing is the opposite of outbound marketing. 
 With inbound marketing, instead of going after your customers and prospects, they come to you. Tweet This  
Because they are coming to you willingly, they are prequalified and; therefore, they are customers who suit your business needs more closely. There are several different ways that you are able to reach your customers and to positively influence them. 
 
You can interact with your target audience over the Internet, through the various social media channels that you have chosen for your particular business, and various other means of online communication. The truth is that business people nowadays are too busy and too impatient to spend a lot of time on anyone or anything. If you can interact with them quickly and effectively, they will listen to you and they will keep coming back for more. It is a win-win situation.   
 Take advantage of what is in front of you  
Most likely, by now, you recognize the importance of interacting with your target audience (and anyone connected to your target audience) online. Online interactions give you to opportunity to reach a very large number of people in the shortest amount of time possible. However, it is very important for you to understand clearly that even though you are involved with inbound marketing for your business and if you are seeing positive results from your marketing efforts, that in no way means that you should abandon your outbound marketing efforts. 
 
Traditional marketing is still very important and you should still retain that as part of your overall marketing strategy. In fact, the two types of marketing should work together and, if you work them correctly, you will see that they have a synergy that is very powerful and that achieves the results that you are hoping to achieve. Some of the marketing strategies that you will definitely not want to abandon are word-of-mouth, referral, and just plain open communication. They will all take you very far.  
 
The good thing about inbound marketing is that it will not eat into your budget very much at all. In many cases, you can achieve results from your inbound marketing efforts without spending any money at all. Of course, the price that you will have to pay is not in dollars. It is in time and effort, which are definitely valuable commodities for you as well. There are many different ways in which you can make a positive difference through your online marketing strategy. 
   
Become an influencer via online marketing:  You need to realize (if you haven’t realized already) that social media is an extremely powerful and influential tool. It behooves you to make the most of it and to leverage all that you can of social media for your business. You may (or you may not) be surprised at how much you can achieve through your social media efforts. 
   
Increase your list of customers through your social media channels:  The most popular social media channels can help you to increase your list of customers. If your branding is strong, which it definitely should be at this point, those social media channels will work in your favor. The fact is that people really want to interact through social media. It is quick, effective, and fun and many people are really interested in being a part of the whole social media scene. 
   
Pay close attention to analytics:  It is essential that you track your business’s progress extremely carefully. One of the many reasons why analytics are so important is that they allow you to understand what you are doing right and what isn’t working. They also allow you to identify trends and you can continue to hone what you are doing and you will see that the results will be positive. 
   
Influence people so that they become loyal to your brand:  Content really is king when it comes to your business’s success. People are not only interested in what you have to say but they are also extremely excited to tell you (and anyone else who is listening) what they think. They want to feel as though you value their opinions. And, why not? It is a human quality to want to be accepted and appreciated. 
   
Position yourself so that you are top of mind for other people:  Again, this goes back to the importance of content. If you share top-quality content with people on interesting, relevant topics, there is no doubt that people will be very interested in what you have to say and in how you say it. In fact, they will probably want to keep coming back for more and they will be excited about sharing your words with people whom they know and trust. That is exactly what you want to happen. 
   Conclusion  
When it comes to your marketing strategy for your business, it is important to remember that both traditional marketing and inbound marketing are important and your marketing strategy will be the most successful if you can use both marketing approaches together. Together, they will create an incredible buzz that people will not soon forget. If your story is sincere and told with heart, people will listen to what you have to say with pleasure. Together, there will be no stopping you!

It could potentially turn into more expensive advertising since this type is quite common both online as well as offline because there's no margin between these two sides during periods of intense sales/losing money vs receiving something like $10+ at Sears after hitting some ""sucks off"" price point just prior giving it its proper time spin…just note how effective getting things so long ago can sometimes become especially difficult:

The spun-steel shades of Nichetto's Alphabeta lamp are used in pairs to direct light up and down from the source. Each of the shades can be selected by the customer online in any combination of shapes and colours. 
 
""Alphabeta is the world's first digitally customisable pendant lamp with more than 10 billion possible combinations, all in-stock, and shipped free to Hem customers,"" said a statement from the brand. 
 

 
The shades come in eight different shapes of interchangeable top and bottom shades, available in a range of hues, as well as in black and in white. 
 
This creates a total of 24 available shades, which allow for a vast number of possible combinations when displayed in groups – like letters in the alphabet.

""My inspiration was really an ambition to create an alphabet; a system where you can combine different kinds of shades to create your own lamps,"" said Nichetto, who launched his eponymous design brand earlier this year. 
 
""I researched different kinds of shades and effects of light, and tried to simplify that by creating a single piece that can be combined with the other shades, to create a kind of alphabet,"" he added. 
 

 
The different shapes include cones, bowls and tubes, all available in a variety of lengths and widths. 
 
""With Alphabeta, we wanted to create a lamp that is made from high quality materials, and allows people to customise and personalise their own lighting,"" said Petrus Palmér, Hem co-founder and head of design.

""Luca Nichetto has a great eye for spotting new behaviours and new needs, and he brought us this idea of a lamp that could be combined in different ways to create your own and unique lamp."" 
 

 
The lamps will displayed in an exhibition titled Ten Designers in the West Wing, taking place at Somerset House from 21 to 27 September during the London Design Festival 2015. Here, 44 of the pendants will be tethered to a grand piano and will illuminate when different keys are played.

I seen the ball, I grabbed it, and I just had go score. I wasn’t surprised until I was on the sideline and I was like, ‘Wow, that just happened.'” LSU’s Brandon Harris s a game manager and a running threat, writes Ross Dellenger of The Advocate. “Harris has run for nearly as many yards (114) as he has thrown for (145) in the first two games of the season. He’s averaging more per rush (9.8 yards) than he is per completion (6.9). His feet are becoming a key part of LSU’s offense — maybe even more than his arm.” Mark Richt praises Georgia’s receivers, reports Jason Butt of the Macon Telegraph. “There are a lot of things that have to go right for a quarterback to have that kind of day,” Richt said of quarterback Greyson Lambert’s record day against South Carolina. “Certainly, it starts with protection and guys catching the ball on the other end. How many times does the ball get dropped here and there?” Auburn goes from growing pains to pains that are growing, reports James Creapa of AL.com. “Quarterback Jeremy Johnson had his least productive game of the season and had another pair of turnovers. He had just 100 yards passing with two touchdown throws coming with the game well decided and five sacks limited Johnson to 41 yards rushing despite a 65-yard touchdown run.” Auburn can’t hide from failures, reports Mike Niziolek of the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.  “Offense F: Hard to go with anything other than a failing grade when coach Gus Malzahn labeled Saturday’s offensive performance that himself. He attributed much of the problems in the 45-21 loss to LSU to timing issues. He also declined to give quarterback Jeremy Johnson a vote of confidence for the first time this season. Johnson continues to turn the ball over at an alarming rate – six interceptions, one fumble – while struggling to complete even the simplest of throws.” Self-inflicted mistakes prove costly to Alabama, reports Alex Byington of the Montgomery Advertiser. “It hurts, that’s all I can say, man. It felt like we just gave them the game,” Alabama senior corner Cyrus Jones said. “They didn’t come in here and beat us — we messed up. That’s how we feel right now.” Steve Spurrier promises changes, reports Josh Kendall of The State. After the 52-20 loss to Georgia, Spurrier said both Perry Orth and Lorenzo Nunan will be prepared to play at quarterback against Central Florida this Saturday. The Gamecocks are 0-2 in the SEC so they probably welcome a non-conference opponent. For Florida, 3-0 is 3-0, says Pat Dooley of the Gainesville Sun. “Defense A- First half: Florida had some missed tackles again early, but settled into the game by pressuring and sacking Kentucky quarterback Patrick Towles. Second half: The defense had the game put on its shoulders in the second half and responded by making just enough plays. For the game: Kentucky has a pretty good offense and for this defense to hold the Wildcats to three field goals is impressive.” Tennessee is learning from experience, reports Dustin Dopirak of the Knoxville News-Sentinel. “Twenty starters in Saturday’s 55-10 win over Western Carolina at Neyland Stadium were part of last year’s painful defeats at the hands of Florida and Georgia, among others, but also the thrilling overtime comeback victory over South Carolina, the domination of Kentucky and the closer-than-expected win over Vanderbilt.” Are the Vols about to follow Ole Miss into SEC relevancy? asks Mark Wiedmer of the Chattanooga Times Free Press. “Most everyone in the SEC is relevant at the moment, including this weekend’s top combatants — Tennessee and Florida. Both the Vols and Gators got numerous votes for the AP’s Top 25, though they both failed to crack the lineup. The winner between the two this weekend in The Swamp should certainly be ranked next week, however.” Garrett is a one-man wrecking crew for Texas A&M, reports Richard Croome of the Bryan/College Station Eagle. “Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is taking it one step further, seemingly getting around the tackle and to the quarterback so quickly he could catch the snap from center. Garrett made his presence known on the third play from scrimmage in A&M’s 44-27 victory over Nevada on Saturday. The sophomore burst around Wolf Pack tackle Austin Corbett before Corbett could get out of his three-point stance and sacked Tyler Stewart for a 4-yard loss.” Mississippi State building momentum, reports Michael Bonner of the Clarion-Ledger. “Saturday, Dak Prescott was 10 of 11 passing for 227 yards and two touchdowns. The fifth-year senior is 33 of 43 for 474 yards and three touchdowns during the last four quarters.” Texas Tech was happy to put it to Arkansas, reports Eric Bolin of the Arkansas News. “That’s a program that prides itself on being physical,” said Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury. “The Texas high school coaches convention this summer, (Bret Bielema) stood up and said ‘if you don’t play with a fullback, we’ll kick your a—. If you throw it 70 times a game, we’ll kick your a—.’ And he just got his a— kicked twice in a row and probably next week by (Texas) A&M.

6f7c2b7d-00f2-42c1-9693-183b12d6525e,For Women Who Ski: An Interview with TheSkiDiva.com’s Wendy Clinch,Blog,The Brave Ski Mom,"Wendy Clinch and some Ski Divas at Big Sky. Photo courtesy Wendy Clinch. I’ve met some pretty amazing people though Braveskimom.com. And one of my favorites is Wendy Clinch, the founder of TheSkiDiva.com, the leading site for women skiers and snowboarders on the Internet.  Wendy is a good friend, a fun skier and the author of two Ski Diva mysteries. It’s a privilege to share this interview with you today.  BSM: You’re the Founder of TheSkiDiva.com, the largest online ski community for women. What inspired you to start TheSkiDiva.com and what makes you proudest?  Photo courtesy Wendy Clinch. WC: The idea for the site came to me back in 2006. I remember waiting for the gondola at Steamboat, the only woman in a long line of men, feeling very much alone and thinking, ‘I can’t be the only woman who likes to ski.’ I didn’t have any friends who skied. And when I looked at ski magazines or went to one of the online ski communities, I didn’t see many women there, either. Mostly, we were perceived as beginners, or interested only in ski fashions or in hanging out in the lodge. Women’s equipment or needs were barely discussed. And there was a lot of female sexual objectification. I found it all pretty dismaying. So I decided to put together a place where women skiers could come together to talk about skiing in a comfortable space. Today, TheSkiDiva.com is the leading online community for women skiers. It’s fun, informative, and a great place to hang out. I’ve learned so much from the women on the site, and I’ve made tons of ski friends, too. BSM: Do you think women approach skiing differently than men? If so, how?  WC: Definitely. I think women tend to downplay their abilities and are much more critical of the way they ski. There’s less of the testosterone-charged one-upmanship you find with men. Plus women can be extremely supportive. That’s very evident on TheSkiDiva forum, where we help each other with all sorts of ski-related issues, from picking out equipment to dealing with family issues. This translates to life, too. Here’s a example: on one of our Ski Diva trips, a group of us decided to go down something that put a few people a bit on edge. As each woman came down, the others stood by and cheered — yes, cheered. No one heckled or made snide comments. I’m not sure you’d find that with a group of men. BSM: My favorite part of your site is the Forum. I can always find a ton of information and I’ve made some friends through the discussions. Please share some more about it.  WC: The forum is really the heart and soul of the website. Right now we have over 4,400 members from all over the country; actually, all over the world. There’s everyone from beginners to the highest levels of experts; from women who know very little about equipment and technique to those with vast stores of expertise. We talk about anything and everything ski-related — gear, technique, resorts, and more. There are loads of firsthand gear reviews and discussions about various ski destinations. And there’s a lot of great advice, like what to do when you think your skiing has plateaued or how to handle fear or even why more women aren’t skiing. It changes daily, so you have to keep checking back all the time. One thing I have to mention is how blown away I am by the women in TheSkiDiva community. Some online forums can be pretty awful, with a lot of sniping and trash talk. This isn’t the case at TheSkiDiva. The members are supportive, friendly, good-natured, and respectful. It makes participating on the site an absolute pleasure.  BSM: You’ve been planning Ski Diva East and West gatherings for several years, where women get together for a ski vacation. What are your plans for Ski Diva gatherings in 2015/16? WC: I started having SkiDiva get-togethers  so we could get to know the people behind the user names. Plus there’s something freeing about skiing with a group of girlfriends. You laugh a lot. You have great conversations on the lifts. You’re free of the label of girlfriend, mother, wife, caregiver. It’s just you, the mountains, the snow, and TheSkiDivas. What could be better? The Ski Divas at Snowbasin, Utah. Photo courtesy Wendy Clinch. We generally have two events a year: one in the west and one in the east. In the west, we’ve been to such places as Solitude, Summit County, Steamboat, Tahoe, Big Sky and Snowbasin. And in the east, Sugarloaf, White Face, Sunday River and Killington. The trips are open to members of the forum and their families. I can honestly say that every one of our meet-ups has been a blast. Women come from all over. And even if we’ve never met in person, it’s like getting together with old friends. The whole thing is a testament to the feeling of community that pervades the site. This year, Diva West is March 5 -1 2 at Big Sky, Montana. Diva East is March 20-23 at Jay Peak, Vermont. BSM: Please tell me about your skiing life. Photo courtesy Wendy Clinch. WC: I grew up on the Jersey Shore and didn’t start skiing til I was 13 and we went on a family trip to the Catskills in New York. At first I absolutely hated it — I fell a lot, and the rope tow up the beginners’ slope was a nightmare. But I kept at it, mainly to get better at it than my sister. I actually didn’t ski all that much — maybe 10 times a year — and stopped entirely in my early twenties. Life just got in the way. Fifteen years went by, and one morning my husband asked me if I wanted to go skiing. To put it in his words, it was like handing a crack pipe to an addict. Now I live in Vermont and ski about 90 days a year. Most of my skiing is at Okemo, though I also manage to hit a lot of places throughout New England and go out west once or twice a year. Amazingly enough, my daughter doesn’t ski. She had a lot of health issues when she was little, which partly explains why I stopped for 15 years. When she was about 12 she took a few lessons, but it just didn’t click. Hey, skiing isn’t for everyone, and I’m a firm believer that you can’t force your passions on your kids. It just creates problems. Now that she’s an adult, she’s starting to think about skiing again. So maybe there’s hope. BSM: In addition to operating TheSkiDiva.com, you’re also the author of two Ski Diva mysteries. What inspired you to write these books? Are you working on any other books or have other interesting projects you’d like to share? WC: DOUBLE BLACK came out in 2010, and FADE TO WHITE in 2011. Both focus on a young woman who leaves her cheating fiancé to become a ski bum in a small Vermont town. She’s looking for the life she’s always dreamed about, but stumbles instead into financial intrigue, bitter family warfare, and, of course, murder. In many ways, and as funny as it may sound, the main character, Stacey Curtis, is the person I never gave myself the chance to be. When I graduated from college I got married and went straight to work and pretty much traded in skiing for the pressures of daily life. Not that I’ve regretted a minute of it, but I’ve always wondered what course my life would have taken if I’d followed a less-conventional path. Now Stacey’s doing that on my behalf! I was inspired to write for two reasons: First, because it gave me a good excuse to think about skiing during the off-season, and second, because my husband, Jon Clinch, is also a writer. His first book, FINN, was named one of the best books of 2007 by The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, and The Chicago Tribune. And his second book, KINGS OF THE EARTH, was number 1 on Oprah’s summer reading list in 2010. But writing is really hard work and my off seasons have been kind of busy. So I think I’m done, at least for a while. BSM: Finally, what puts the Diva in a Ski Diva?  WC: That’s a good question. Diva has come to have a negative connotation: it can mean someone who’s temperamental and kind of a pain in the butt. But the original Latin meaning of Diva is Goddess, and I like to think that all women who love to ski are ski goddesses in their own right.

Oh, I missed the Outback caused some of my leg injuries", first Snowboarding Event in New York City was an entire year ago during Skate Race 2016 that took place March 30th-29st where we were able (with help) manage over 3 hours until all four routes started being added together again due to weather issues related to heavy equipment raining down from above & ice falling quickly into our lap before putting them back onto their rails or using something else's track when getting ready by running around wearing nothing but underwear as well so they can move faster then us each other like 5 mins per step if possible! So i think it comes out better now because obviously there are more opportunities – skiing than ever - which means everyone enjoys new things such ASCEASES has got access to even upcycled tracks without needing anyone watching who really knows any sport ahead just trying do fast runs while still enjoying EVERYTHING IN between!!!!

The 2015 list of Top 100 Associate Degree Producers by Community College Week magazine listed LSC fifth in the nation among the more than 1,100 community colleges for the number of associate degrees awarded. Community College Week reported LSC awarded 4,409 associate degrees to students in all disciplines based on the 2013-2014 school year data derived from their analysis of U.S. Department of Education data.

LSC also ranked third among community colleges nationwide in the 2015 list for the number of Hispanic students receiving their associate degrees. 1,334 Hispanic graduates, representing 30 percent of the total LSC graduates earned their associate degree in 2013-2014, a 15 percent increase over degrees awarded in 2012-13.

Nationally, community colleges enroll 56 percent of all Hispanic undergraduates.

Other notable rankings for LSC in the Community College Week 2015 nationwide list include:

•Fourth in nursing, registered nursing, administration, nursing research and clinical nursing degrees

•Third in liberal arts and sciences, general studies and humanities associate degrees

•Second in education associate degrees

•Fifth in health professions and related programs

•Sixth in all degrees among minorities

“From the moment a student walks into the door, we are ready to assist them with academic advisors, counseling services and success programs to help them achieve their goals,” said Head.

The Top 100 Associate Degree Producers list is compiled by the magazine each year from data derived from a Community College Week analysis of U.S. Department of Education data. The 2015 list contains data from the 2013-14 academic year. Community College Week, one of several national publications covering the education industry, publishes the rankings each fall.

Lone Star College has been opening doors to a better community for more than 40 years. Founded in 1973, LSC remains steadfast in its commitment to student success and credential completion. Today, with almost 83,000 students in credit classes, and a total enrollment of more than 95,000, Lone Star College is the largest institution of higher education in the Houston area and one of the fastest-growing community colleges in the nation.

0c434721-8015-4f30-b3c8-da1746d9213c,Todd Haynes’ “Carol” Headlines This Year’s NewFest,Blog,NewNowNext,"Academy Award-hopeful Carol may have famously skipped the Toronto International Film Festival, but one place it won’t be skipping is New York’s annual LGBT film festival, NewFest, where it will serve as the festival’s centerpiece. 
 Related: Cate Blanchett Seduces Rooney Mara (And Us) In “Carol” Trailer  
The film, starring Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and nominee Rooney Mara, focuses on 20-something Therese (Mara) who falls in love with the older, married, titular Carol (Blanchett) in 1950’s New York. 
 
Based on the novel, “The Price of Salt” by Patricia Highsmith, the plot sees both women forming an intimate relationship amongst Carol’s impending divorce and Therese’s loveless relationship with her boyfriend. 
      
The film has already been acclaimed for its central performances, direction, costumes and production design following its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, where it won Best Actress for Mara and the festival’s Queer Palm award, given to LGBT-relevant films who compete at Cannes. 
 
Carol is joined by nearly 100 other LGBT-centric feature, documentary and short films. 
 
We chatted with NewFest’s Executive Director, Adam Baran, who shared some of his personal favorites from the lineup.  
  Eisenstein in Guanajuato  

 Director/Screenwriter: Peter Greenaway 
 
Based on Russian-filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein’s gay coming-of-age trip to Mexico in 1930, where the (then) 33 year old lost his virginity. 
 
“The film is extremely edgy, and very sexually explicit… but at its core it’s a film about film, which I think viewers will really enjoy.” 
 
The film will kick off NewFest’s Opening Night Gala. 
 Girls Lost       
Director: Alexandra-Therese Keining 
 
Adapted from the 2011 novel “Pojkarna” by Jessica Schiefauer, The Hollywood Reporter calls the film, “An original take on adolescent desire and gender identity.” Focused on a group of girls (two lesbian, one trans questioning) who find a magical tree that offers them a way to escape from their lives, by becoming boys for a few hours. 
 
“Their transformations bring positive things, but also complications… it’s very punk,” Baran says, “It features music from the likes of The Knife on the soundtrack, and is extremely compelling.” 
 
After enjoying its world premiere at last week’s Toronto Film Festival, the film will serve as the festivals closing presentation. 
 Everlasting Love  

 Director: Marçal Forés 
 
Described as an “unconventional horror film”, a teacher begins a steamy affair with his student, a teenage boy. Baran describes the film as “Hannibal meets Stranger by the Lake”. It will serve as one of the features included in the Queer Horror part of the festival, along with You’re Killing Me and Sisters of the Plague. 
 The Glamour and the Squalor  

 Director: Marq Evans 
 
The DJ behind the success of musical acts like Beck, Nirvana and Weezer gets a close up. The film is a detailed look at the complicated life behind all of Seattle DJ Marco Collins’ wild success. 
 
“I think this will be especially poignant given all of the 90’s revivalism currently happening at the moment,” Baran says. “The film explores his issues with drugs and the repression of his sexuality.” 
 The Year We Thought About Love  

 Director: Ellen Brodsky 
 
“This is a film I’m really excited about,” Baran says, “A LGBT theater group consisting of mainly inner city kids travels around to different high schools and acts out their coming out stories for students. It’s truly inspiring.” 
 The Girl King  

 Director: Mika Kaurismäki 
 
A biopic centered on Queen Kristina of Sweeden set in the 17th century. 
 
“It’s this really great look at how courageous she was,” Baran says, “She was an open lesbian, and the film explores how that impacted her reign and the decisions she made.”

Bra Gee 
Who am I? Please clap hands for me as I single-handedly kept our patriotism alive. I am one of those high ranking civil servants who did not bother to read Bra Gee’s open letter last weekend. You will most probably know my name in connection with matters personal rather than professional even though I am a full Cabinet minister and have served at His Excellency’s pleasure for a while now. 

Anyway, I am proud to say that I kept one Aliko Dangote cooling his heels in my boardroom for 15 minutes while I concentrated on the important aspects of running my ministry which is my core business. 

I understand that everyone else including my bosses cleared their decks and made Mr Dangote a priority on their day’s schedule. I am also told that my colleagues also made sure that they were not found wanting. 

But not me. I had him shown into my ministry’s boardroom and let him count the minutes until I turned up. We need to set the right tone right from the beginning. This here is our country and anyone who wants to do business with us must know their place. As we say in Shona a prince becomes a slave the moment he steps out of demesne. 

Back to school blues 

We have absolutely no sympathy for those running around from one loan shark to another trying to secure funds for little Tatenda to go finish off the school year. If you had added up all that money you spent at the show and at those miracle nights you would not be in this situation. Let us not even talk about the cartons of fast food that you seem to think are a status symbol and not a health hazard. 

And of course we have no sympathy either for the regulars who bought us drinks and kept the braai stand sizzling. Although we are grateful for the drink, it is not our fault that you decided to drink first and think later. And we are tired of giving this little sermon at the end of every school holiday. But thank goodness, we know that no one ever listens and we are already getting ready for a very merry festive season at the expense of such regulars. 

The pearly gates now on earth 

This week we will not talk about the brisk business that was reportedly enjoyed by one of the country’s foremost entrepreneurs last week as oranges retailing at three dollars each were rapidly sold out like the legendary hot cakes. 

Like we always say, fools and their money are not meant to stay in close proximity and we only wish we too could develop the requisite charisma to go into gospreneurship. 

Which brings us to the day’s topic, which is what we saw and heard at the funeral of the snotty relative of one regular this past week. 

At the usual place we have never made it a secret that we will always prefer a good funeral to a wedding any day of the week, especially if the bereaved are in a position to throw a fine wake where meat and drink supplies are unlimited. 

Our objections at the weddings are too many, but we will share a few. First of all we object to the fact that most of those who call upon us to witness their exchange of vows will be lying to us, God and the marriage officer. Then of course we resent the sermonising coming from people who will most probably be also lying as they extol the virtues of monogamy which they do not practise themselves. 

As if the above points are not bad enough, most of all, we have to endure the hypocrisy on very dry throats as decent drinks only come later, then only if there are some regulars involved in the planning. We are beginning to wonder if some of these young people are finding religion just as a way to cut their budget by having a legitimate excuse not to buy booze. Because that is the only area in which their religious teaching holds pole position. When it comes to other points like fornication and the honouring of parents, they seem to create new creeds. 

But funerals we have always liked, especially the wakes. There even the most stringent prayer warriors cannot keep the joy from flowing for if they refuse to do the honours we will bring our own drinks. And afterwards, we are quite content to sit through the service while the clueless preachers imagine that this is the time to convert us instead of praying for the departed. 

So being regular patrons, we have noted a rather surprising trend at most funerals these days. The preacher be they pastor, reverend, bishop or prophet will confidently declare, “The family must not cry. So and so has gone straight to heaven and is now smiling in God’s arms. Amai fought a good fight and is now enjoying her reward.” This is usually said about women, mostly elderly ones who will have lived a life of faithful tithing. 

Huh! The pearly gates are now in Zimbabwe and the various preachers have been ordained the St Peters in situ? Last time we checked the good book it said something about judgement being for the most high court or something. But then again, our contact with the said good book is rather limited and we cannot argue with people who have made profitable careers out of deciphering it. So let the bereaved families continue to give a generous gratuity to the preacher who will have comforted them by declaring that their dearly beloved mother is now safely in heaven. 

Nothing is for free on this good earth, we tell you. 

Love Triangles and smuggling 

Bra Gee has learnt of an interesting love triangle relating to two prominent people and the concubine of one of them. Apparently the concubine of one rich man who is no stranger to controversy and legal battles cases pertaining to the succour of his offspring decided that she was tired of being one on a string of many. So she found herself a partner who is not very young either and is reputed to have been a high ranking member or the infamous cabal during its heydays. 

Meanwhile the concubine’s first mate has been sprinkling his seed among the young women of Zimbabwe. So everything was cool, but they could not all live happily ever after. The concubine was financing her lover until she realised that she was being taken for a ride. Now she wants her money back and the lover seems to be insolvent. 

He is one of the prominent names who made our week a couple of months back when an auctioneer flogged off what appeared to be his household chattels over payments long overdue to some snooty education establishment . 

But that is not all. The lover seems to be haunted by two vehicles which he rescued in the nick of time from yet another auctioneer’s hammer. But the two vehicles appear to have dodgy registration credentials with neither ZINARA nor ZIMRA seeming to have any record of their existence. 

We sip or drinks while awaiting the long arm of the law to finally catch up with this long time miscreant. Or maybe the cuckolded concubine owner will shoot the fellow love rat.

da8aa49e-c1da-4275-997b-2830d7c6484a,‘Universities must help migrant students’,News,Independent On Saturday,"Every university in Britain is being urged to play its part in tackling the migrant crisis by helping make it easier for refugees and asylum-seekers to access higher education. 
 
A group of academics have written an open letter to university vice-chancellors calling on them each to create five undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships and bursaries for students fleeing violence and war. 
 
Charities have already been working with some universities to fund a small number of tuition-fee bursaries for student asylum-seekers, but academics and campaigners now want every institution to play its part. 
 
Academics who are members of the Campaign for the Public University, which was launched to challenge the introduction of tuition fees, have joined forces with the Citizens UK campaign group to make the call. 
 
They are also urging people to sign a petition backing the proposals. 
 
Gurminder Bhambra, professor of sociology at the University of Warwick and co-founder of the Campaign for the Public University, said: “It's important that human rights to education beyond national boundaries are recognised. Access to higher education enables individuals to develop their talents and use those talents to contribute to the societies that provide them with shelter.” 
 
George Gabriel from Citizens UK said: “We are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis and every bit of society needs to play its part. Tens of thousands of people are stepping forward to help, and Britain's universities need to do the same.” 
 
Asylum-seekers in the UK are not allowed to work and have no right to grants or loans that would help them pay for the hugely expensive university tuition fees normally paid by international students. 
 
The academics want universities to form closer links with projects including Article 26, which is working with 18 universities to promote access to higher education for people claiming asylum. The organisation is named after the article of the Human Rights Act which says everyone has an equal right to access higher education based on merit and not on class or ethnicity. 
 
University researcher Rebecca Murray, who runs the project, said: “The journey to the UK for migrants is treacherous, but crossing the border isn't the end of that difficult journey. In many ways it's the beginning. They just want to get on in very tough circumstances. If they get the right support, they can become a valuable part of society.” 
 
Some universities have already announced major plans to accept refugee students. The University of East London has offered 10 scholarships to Syrians sheltering in refugee camps, while the University of Sheffield is offering scholarships to students from Syria showing “exceptional academic potential”. 
 
The University of York has launched a £500,000 package of initiatives to help refugees, including scholarships, and the University of Warwick has also offered to provide 20 scholarships. 
 
Case study  
 
'I don't want a handout. I just want to get on'  
 
As he leafs through his books on theoretical physics, Abbas looks like any other student. 
 
But the 26-year-old from Somalia is actually one of dozens of people seeking asylum who are striving to obtain degrees in the UK without financial support. 
 
They are not allowed to work and have no right to grants or loans that would help them pay fees normally paid by international students. But thanks to the support of Article 26, a project of the Helena Kennedy Foundation, young men and women like Abbas are managing to triumph against the odds. The project has developed partnerships with 18 universities to create a number of bursaries for students. 
 
Abbas developed a love of physics after he was detained for four months when he arrived in the UK aged 17, after escaping Somalia's civil war. He is now three years into a four-year physics degree at the University of Manchester and on course for a first-class master's. He is researching how to make LED lights more energy efficient. He said: “My passion for physics grew while I was in detention. I read a book by the physicist Richard Feynman and I was hooked. I really believe that physics can do great things.” 
 
He added: “I don't want a handout from the government. I just want to get on and stand on my own two feet. There are lots of other people like me - people who just want to learn and get on in life so that they can give something back.”

Overall Thoughts There might come room here when you purchase four or more models because they all have been created using only stock aluminium alloy frame design: just sayin'. However there will always still remain one element where we'll feel like an idiot who could easily go missing it altogether – front end power output issues at each drive unit being extremely high amongst factory spec GP bikes which also affects low profile rider performance further down motorway runs between turns due largely uncoordinated driving movement resulting inevitably into higher-end rear shock ratio under aggressive riding conditions/slower pace whilst accelerating etc..

Four people spoke on trans and intersex gender identities from a Catholic perspective at the Transforming Love forum held at the Arch Street United Methodist Church across the street from the World Conference of Families in Philadelphia on Saturday morning. The event was originally scheduled to take place at the St. John the Evangelist parish , but according to organizers was, “evicted from the space by Archbishop Charles Chaput of the Philadephia Archdiocese.” 
 
Pope Francis is in Philadelphia today and will be attending events around Philadelphia in concert with the World Conference of Families. It is unknown if the Pope has any knowledge of the LGBTQI counter programming. He was invited to a picnic made up of 14 families grappling with LGBTQI acceptance, but due to the blocked roads I was unable to attend that event. 
 
New Ways Ministry , Dignity USA , Fortunate Families , and Call to Action organized the gender identity counter programming and are all groups working to gain “reconciliation” for LGBTQI Catholics “within the larger Catholic and civil communities.” The groups are trying to add depth to the official conversation about LGBTQI issues at the World Conference, which includes only “ one presentation on homosexuality , led by a celibate gay man, among a long list of panels” on other subjects. 
 
When the Catholic Church refused to host, the groups quickly lined up a space at the Methodist church. This church has a large rainbow flag on the outside, clearly visible from the convention center. On the day of the event the streets around the church and convention center were blocked off in a maze of security fences ahead of the Pope’s arrival. That made navigation virtually impossible even while walking, Attendees were not deterred, however. I was pleasantly surprised to see forty people eager to engage with the speakers. 
 
Julie Chovanes 
 
Sister Jeannine Grammick lead the group in prayer, then introduced Julie Chovanes , a transexual woman and patent lawyer who lives in Philadelphia. Chovanes is still married to the woman she has had four children with, her youngest child is fifteen years old. She transitioned while maintaining her legal career and her family. 
 
Chovannes was raised in the Byzantine Catholic tradition, a very conservative tradition. Coming out and transitioning has been a challenge, but she feels she has “been accepted in the city, I feel that Philadelphia is the best city in the world for [trans persons].” 
 
“I don’t consider myself a man or a girl,” said Chovanes, “I am a trans. My brain and my soul are a woman’s, but my body is a man’s… My life is a testament to God’s glory.” 
 
delfine bautista 
 
delfine bautista identifies as trans*, specifically as two-spirit or gender queer. delfine prefers the pronoun “they” to “he” or “she.” They has a graduate degree in divinity and social work and serves as the director of Ohio University’s LGBT Center. 
 
“I am a Catholic,” says delfine. “I was assigned the gender, male, at birth, but at the age of three I knew i was different.” 
 
Growing up in a conservative, Latino household made gender questioning impossible. “Being different is not an option.” In secret, “I wore dresses and played princess. I prayed every night to wake up in a new body, but was greeted with silence.” 
 
“When I came out I came out as gay,” said delfine, “because that’s all I knew, but even then I knew it didn’t fit me… My mom wanted to help me and sent me to therapy to be cured. I don’t hate my mother, she was trying to help me.” delfine’s mother was in the audience. 
 
delfine’s divinity work came to the fore when he put out the following ideas, “In Genesis God made man and woman in his own image. Is God trans, intersex, queer? [What about] persons like Joan of Arc.?Her actions were gender bending, and she’s a saint… I am more than one thing. I am more than one identity. Sometimes [my identities] clash, but I am a hot mess, and I embrace the mess.” 
 
Vima Santamaria 
 
Vilma Santamaria is a Salvadoran teacher, sociologist and the mother of Nicole Santamaria , an intersex woman and human rights activist. “I realized that when my daughter was really little, she was different. She said she didn’t like girls.” [Note that Santamaria’s daughter was assigned a male gender at birth.] 
 
When her daughter came out to her, “I told her I would love you, whoever you are… My husband was the main problem.” 
 
Nicole Santamaria elaborated. “When I was three, I realized I was a girl.” Her father hated her feminine qualities. “[I was told,] don’t talk like that, don’t move your hands like that! Oh my God, don’t breathe like that! 
 
Nicole Santamaria 
 
“When I started puberty my breasts started to grow, I never grew hairy, my voice never changed.” Her father reacted brutally. “My father mentally and physically tortured me. He’d heat up coins and burn my nipples.” 
 
Eventually Nicole Santamaria ran away, and started to live her life as a woman. She went to a doctor and told her some of what she was going through. The doctor offered to put her on testosterone so she could develop into a man. She was horrified. She wanted to be a woman. 
 
The doctor had misunderstood. After testing the doctor determined that Nicole Santamaria was intersex. Her breasts had been virtually destroyed by her father’s brutality. After breast reconstruction surgery she found herself able to finally live her life as the woman she had always been. 
 
Nicole Santamaria speaks out as an activist because trans persons are being tortured and murdered in El Salvador. 
 
New Ways Ministry, Executive Director Frank DeBeranardo 
 
“I came here to the World Meeting of Families with Pope Francis, to speak for the voices that were silenced by those who will torture them, by those who will kill them. And the voices that were silenced already by people who feel they have permission and they have the obligation to murder us, to exterminate us, to persecute us, because their religion told them that it is okay to kill a person that is different. When every religious leader spoke out against sexual diversity, or even against abortion, a transgender woman is killed. Every time those kind of things are heard, that means death. Whenever this is reported in the media, you can read the comments from the people, and the comments are, They deserve it, they are abominations, God doesn’t love them, it is okay. 
 
“So as an activist, I really believe that my faith has given me the strength to continue. People tell me, stop! you can live your life with all the privilege of a female, don’t say anything…” and no one would know. 
 
“Let me tell you something, I won’t do that.” 
 
I don’t know if Pope Francis will hear the message of Nicole Santamaria and her mother, or the message of Julie Chevanes and delfine bautista, Certainly the Roman Catholic Church did everything it could to silence and marginalize these people. What we know is that people are suffering and dying, and it is well within the power of the Church to alleviate that evil.",1207,"Arch Street United Methodist Church Four people spoke on trans and intersex gender identities from a Catholic perspective at the Transforming Love forum held at the Arch Street United Methodist Church across the street from the World Conference of Families in Philadelphia on Saturday morning.

The move is the latest example of the Kremlin publicising cases of prominent Westerners who praise Russia or offer symbolic support for Putin’s policies, at a time when Putin is at odds with Western governments over the Ukraine crisis. 
 
A short presidential decree on the Kremlin website said Jones’ request had been granted under an article of the constitution giving the president power to solve questions of Russian citizenship questions. 
 
Jones, a former Olympic silver medalist and winner of multiple world championship titles, met Putin in August in Crimea, the region that Russia annexed from Ukraine last year, where Jones appeared as a guest on a boxing television show. 
 
In televised comments, the boxer had told Putin that a Russian passport would make it easier for him to travel to Russia and that he hoped he could “build a bridge” between Russia and the US. Jones is not the first Russophile Western celebrity to have been granted citizenship by Putin.

Speaking on Tuesday night at the West Indies Rum and Spirit Producers Association's cocktail reception at Accra Beach Hotel, Mr. Inniss lashed out at ""our neighbour in the North"", for its decision in 2007 to impose a 'cover-over' tax on spirits coming out the Caribbean and other parts of the world into the U.S.A. 

Stating that this has made a significant challenge to the rum and spirit manufacturers in the region, the Minister added: ""I think what the United States of America has done is wrong, and it goes against the fundamental tenets of fair trade…It has done and can do considerable damage to the economies in the region, and we have been lobbying over and over again for that cover-over tax to be removed."" 

Before an audience which included the European Union's Ambassador, Mikael Barford, Mr. Inniss explained that the tax made it difficult for regional rum to compete in the U.S. market against similar products being manufactured in the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. 

He praised the rum producers for focusing on niche markets, branding and pitching their products above what the competitors were offering. The Industry Minister also urged the local bars, restaurants and hotels around the region to serve West Indian products first and foremost. 

""I do not think a visitor to the Caribbean should be getting the same experience that they get in the cities they come from. And, that rum experience must be part of their experience that they take back home,"" he opined.

Soft drinks producer Highland Spring is hoping a £20 million investment in its Perthshire headquarters can quench demand for its bottled water. 

The firm said the planned eight-figure investment would see an extension added to its existing manufacturing facility at Blackford and a new production line installed. 

Planning documents for the project are expected to be lodged with Perth and Kinross Council in the coming days. 

They follow an application to add a rail halt at the site to aid distribution. 

In 2014 the group retained its position as the UK’s number one water brand, producing around 470 million litres of bottled drinks. 

That figure could push past 500m litres this year, and the company said the proposed new production line would add a further 250m litres of capacity. 

However, that will not all be used instantly but will be gradually brought on as the market continues to expand. 

“The UK bottled water market has been in double-digit growth for the past three years,” group chief executive Les Montgomery said. 

“We almost put an extension on at Blackford 10 years ago but we bought a business down at Lennoxtown instead. 

“But we are now back looking at Blackford and, assuming all goes well, we will start building in early spring next year with a view to completion in late autumn.” 

Details of the Blackford plan came as the firm revealed sales topped £100m  in the year to December 31, 2014. 

Adjusting for a historic VAT issue, underlying operating profit in the period increased by £800,000 to £3.9m. 

The figures are from the full-year accounts, which were being lodged yesterday and are expected to be published at Companies House in the coming days. 

Mr Montgomery said seeing sales surpass the £100m mark was a significant milestone for the business. 

He said 2015 was shaping up “extremely well”, and the outlook for the business was also good as the market trend continued to favour healthier drinking choices 

“Our long-term business strategy remains firmly focused on continuing to be the UK’s leading supplier of natural sourced waters, as well as developing our product portfolio including private label business in plain and flavoured waters,” Mr Montgomery said. 

“We will continue to invest profits back into the business to ensure long-term sustainable growth.”",400,Soft drinks producer Highland Spring is hoping a £20 million investment in its Perthshire headquarters can quench demand for its bottled water.

e4cc2e40-c2cc-42cf-b901-abc0f20b614b,Marifil Letter to Shareholders,News,Nasdaq,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/08/15 -- Marifil Mines Limited (TSX VENTURE:MFM) 

Dear Shareholders: 

Here in the Northwest we have had one of the hottest summers in recent years. This heat is in sharp contrast to the cold market for junior mining companies but like the weather, markets are cyclical too! The more they swing on the downside the larger the swing on the way up. 

Marifil has been hit with two large cycles: the junior markets and Argentina's economy. We believe that both are about to turn around and that we will reap twice the benefits. You do not want to miss this one. 

The Junior Mining Market The past year has been difficult for the junior mining sector amidst falling metal prices and subdued investment levels. However, several successful market writers believe that the junior market is at or very near bottom and that this is the time to look at juniors with great properties and management teams. The turnaround time is unknown but with the world's population growing steadily commodity demand will surely grow with it. 

We are optimistic about the future of our projects. The average life of gold mines is about 8 years so there will be numerous mine closures in the coming years and those resources will have to be replaced. Marifil Mines is well situated through its diverse mineral properties to take advantage of this situation. Our property portfolio includes gold, silver, platinum, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, indium, molybdenum, potash, sulfur, limestone, and oil and gas. Argentina Regarding Argentina, national elections are coming up in October. Our information is that all of the leading candidates are pro-business and ""mine friendly"". The new government knows they have to stimulate new business to grow the economy. Mining will be near the top of their list. 

Moreover, Argentina, compared to other developed countries, has a huge untapped resource base. The country has abundant hydro power, a well-established transportation system, a literacy rate of 95% and a young eager work force. 

Marifil's Key Properties We want our shareholders to be aware we are maintaining our key mining properties and working with several groups interested in joint ventures to develop them. 

San Roque - Three companies have signed confidentiality agreements to evaluate this important project. One of these companies has had teams of geologists on site numerous times. The Company believes that we will be able to sign a joint venture within the next few months. 

Punta Colorada - During the past year we have been working with a company who wishes to purchase up to 17 million tons of limestone. A second group, a cement producer in Argentina, has had a team evaluating the remainder of the deposit. This group's team has taken more than 300 samples. 

Arroyo Verde - We have signed an option agreement to re-acquire this property, which contains both an epithermal gold target and a porphyry copper target.

The gold target was the subject of an NI 43-101 compliant report including a resource calculation but the report was never filed with the securities commission (see Marifil News Release, January 10, 2012). This report describes a zone of economic significance defined by 18 drill holes and 12 trenches with an Inferred Resource of 386,000 tonnes averaging 7.60 gpt gold and 276.80 gpt silver or 12.22 gpt gold equivalent. An additional Inferred Resource of 39,375 tonnes averaging 6.78 gpt gold and 135.30 gpt silver or 9.03 gpt gold equivalent was calculated for the Hanging Wall Vein Number 1 as defined by two drill holes. 

The two Inferred Resources contain approximately 163,000 ounces of gold equivalent. Because the report was not filed with the securities commission the tonnage and grade estimates described in it must be considered historic estimates only and cannot be relied upon by investors.

The molybdenum-copper porphyry target area is about 8 kilometers south of the epithermal gold veins and is approximately 9 km long by 4 km wide. The target has been defined by IP geophysical study, geochemical surveys, alteration mapping, and eight drill holes. The drill results are sufficiently encouraging to justify additional exploratory holes.

Las Aguilas - A private group is conducting a detailed engineering study on the copper-nickel-PGM massive sulfide deposit with the intent of seeking Argentinian investors to develop it. 

These are four of the 16 diversified mineral properties we hold across Argentina. We are working on others and are also in the process of identifying and acquiring new properties including one bulk tonnage property with important similarities to our San Roque project. 

Management would like to thank you for your ongoing support through these very difficult down cycles. We are optimistic about the future.

You do not know what new mining opportunities are going to decimate you if those favorable events result isn't accompanied by similar events. One of those important changes is that the shares of Reava are rising. Our shares are up about 12.5%, reflecting the pickup in wholesale mining activity since the fire last month. All that extra boom has helped us obtain more customers than ever before even though there were still many"," not need any further foresight before investing your money into our company or its employees such as us; after all you did see what happened here during a time when there were still miners operating below $40 per tonne earning over 100 times less income than anyone would've earned at this age alone!!!
When I was managing share prices it became obvious through research by my friend Jeff Wiedes who came across these reports quite interesting...I saw them so often recently since their website moved online several days ago..They showed big swings between June-October which didn't feel especially favourable towards me personally because then again people might think 'hey if only someone could get out from under him AND make half his profit…' After seeing some analysis done other news organizations also reported similar stories within minutes haha Well nothing can be taken away based predominantly upon an anecdotal view & speculation - those little trends tend never go unnoticed

If the 2014 Olympics are held in Los Angeles, $500 million is going to be spent on renovations—for the two week period do the event. Then this massive investment will go to waste for another 20-40 years. Is this a wise expenditure? Then $925 million will be spent on an Olympic Village—for a four week period. Will the city then use this temporary project be used to house the homeless? A couple of days ago the broke city announced it will spend $100 million to house the homeless—the Village could be the Trump Towers for the LA homeless! 
 
“According to the Los Angeles 2024 Bid Committee (“LA24”), these Olympics will generate revenues of $4.8 billion and a profit of $161 million.  This is after taking into account a $400 million contingency fund, an insurance premium of $150 million designed to protect the City against any unforeseen events and losses, and $200 million to reimburse the City for its services. 
 
However, it does not take into account $1.7 billion that will be provided by the private sector.  This includes $500 million to renovate the Memorial Coliseum (this is in addition to the $300 million provided by LA24), $925 million for the Olympic Village, and $275 million for other competitive venues.  It also does not include funds for the broadcast center at NBC/Universal or the cost of security.” 
 
Can we afford the Olympics? We have no water, pensions are collapsing, potholes not being filled and Los Angeles has turned into an image of the Third World. How about correcting the problems before we invite the world to see a first class Third World city? Written by Jack Humphreville, City Watch LA, 9/22/15 
 
LA WATCHDOG–Los Angeles has submitted its bid to the International Olympic Committee (“IOC”) to be the Host City for the 2024 Summer Olympics. However, one very important caveat was inserted by the City Council which requires it to approve any future contracts with the IOC. This is designed to protect our cash strapped City from having to indemnify the IOC and the United States Olympic Committee (“USOC”) against any losses if LA is selected as the Host City. 
 
In the words of City Council President Herb Wesson:  “In essence, we have bought the City time to properly negotiate.  This is the engagement.  It’s not the wedding. And now it’s time to work on the pre-nup.” 
 
But this does not mean we live happily ever after.  Our City is not off the financial hook because a lot of spaghetti and meatballs can hit the fan between now and September of 2017 when the IOC selects the Host City and 2024 if LA is home to the Summer Olympics. 
 
According to the Los Angeles 2024 Bid Committee (“LA24”), these Olympics will generate revenues of $4.8 billion and a profit of $161 million.  This is after taking into account a $400 million contingency fund, an insurance premium of $150 million designed to protect the City against any unforeseen events and losses, and $200 million to reimburse the City for its services. 
 
However, it does not take into account $1.7 billion that will be provided by the private sector.  This includes $500 million to renovate the Memorial Coliseum (this is in addition to the $300 million provided by LA24), $925 million for the Olympic Village, and $275 million for other competitive venues.  It also does not include funds for the broadcast center at NBC/Universal or the cost of security. 
 
While the City Council has the right to approve any contracts with the USOC and the IOC, that may be increasingly difficult as the selection date approaches and the IOC starts playing LA off against Paris, Rome, Hamburg, and Budapest. 
 
To protect our City and its taxpayers from a multiyear financial hangover, the City needs to ensure that the projections do not overstate the revenues and benefits and understate the costs. 
 
To proceed, the City and LA24 must meet the following ten requirements prior to the submission of its final offer to host the 2024 Summer Olympics. 
 
One:  The County and the State, along with the City, agree to backstop any losses incurred by the IOC.  This will spread the risk to match the tax benefits and provide further insight into LA24’s revenue and cost projections. 
 
Two:  The City and LA24 agree to hire an experienced and well-heeled operator to manage the Olympics. This operator would absorb a major portion of the risk in return for a piece of the action and a hefty insurance premium.  One alternative is AEG, the owner of Staples and Stub Hub and the manager of numerous venues around the world.  This will also result in additional review and analysis of LA24’s revenue and cost projections. 
 
Three:  The City and LA24 enter into an agreement with the private and public sector unions not to strike any Olympic venue before or during the Olympics. 
 
Four: The City and LA24 arrange for tight security for the Games.  This will require the cooperation of Washington as well as federal dollars. 
 
Five: The City and LA24 confirm the funding of the $500 million renovation of the Memorial Coliseum as USC will not raid its endowment. 
 
Six:  The City and LA24 arrange for the financing of the Olympic Village as well as its location.  Union Pacific’s Piggyback Yard, located on the LA River north of DTLA, may not be a suitable site because of its closure may have an adverse impact on the Port and the Alameda Corridor. 
 
Seven: Who will pay for the broadcast center at NBC Universal? 
 
Eight:  The City and LA24 operate in an open and transparent manner; will disclose the economics of the IOC, the USOC, and all participating countries; and agree not to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
 
Nine:  City Hall agrees not to meddle in the operations and decision making process. According to Mayor Tom Bradley, this was the key to the success of the 1984 Olympics. 
 
Ten:  No free tickets or special privileges for our Elected Elite. 
 
We all want a happy marriage between LA and the Olympics.  We want to enjoy the Games and the benefits it will provide to our City and its economy.  But this union must be done in a prudent manner as our City cannot afford to backstop any losses because it does not have the resources to even fill its potholes or fix its broken sidewalks. 
 
The alternative will be very messy as Angelenos will march to the ballot box to approve a measure will prohibit the use of public funds to support the Olympics.

Home schooling is marginally ahead of public schools overall, but fails to distinguish itself in any specific areas of learning and enrichment

NEW YORK 

However, other schooling systems are getting better grades – dramatically better, in the case of private schools. In particular, four in ten Americans believe religious private schools provide an excellent or very good education (40% each primary and secondary), while just under four in ten say the same of private schools without religious affiliations (38% primary, 39% secondary).

These are some of the results of The Harris Poll® of 2,273 U.S. adults surveyed online between July 15 and 20, 2015 

Charter schools also outpace public, albeit less dramatically than their private counterparts: nationally, just over a quarter of American give charter schools excellent or very good ratings for the quality of education they provide (26% primary, 27% secondary).

Homeschooling draws slightly stronger excellent or very good ratings than public schools as well (23% primary, 22% secondary). National homeschooling perceptions show little change since 2008, when two in ten Americans rated homeschooling excellent/very good (20% each primary and secondary).

A school for every subject 

Private schools are dramatically more likely than public schools or home schooling to be seen as providing a better education in most areas measured: Private schools are also most likely – albeit with public schools in a closer second place – to be seen as better at preparing students for employment (34% private vs. 24% public, 6% home), teaching good citizenship (32% vs. 24%, 10%), and education for special needs children (31% vs. 27%, 12%). 

On the other hand, Americans are most likely to believe public schools are better at teaching students to get along with people from different backgrounds (54% vs. 16% private, 3% home), social skills with peers (45% vs. 25%, 4%), and physical education (41% vs. 18%, 5%). 

Americans don't see homeschooling at the head of the class in any of the categories tested.

Do's and don'ts 

Nine in ten adults believe students benefit from having music included in their curriculum (89%), and 84% believe that participation in a physical education class or a sport should be a requirement for all students. These attitudes echo previous Harris Poll findings underscoring the perceived importance of music and sports participation and the dividends each can pay later in life. Strong majorities of adults also believe students benefit from having art included in their curriculum (89%) and from learning real-world skills (95%). 

A strong majority also believes that school uniforms are beneficial (60%), while only three in ten Americans agree that students' education benefits when classes are separated by gender (27%).

Methodology 

This Harris Poll was conducted online, in English, within the United States 

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, The Harris Poll avoids the words ""margin of error"" as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal.

Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Harris Poll surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in our panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

These statements conform to the principles of disclosure of the National Council on Public Polls.

""The refugee issue is more about geopolitical risks and the humanitarian matters caused by them,"" Deputy Prime Minister Cevdet Yilmaz said after a two-day conference in Ankara of G20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs.
""It will definitely be dealt with at the leaders' level politically,"" he said.
Turkey, the G20's president this year, will host the summit in Antalya on November 15-16.
Europe is facing an unprecedented influx of people seeking a haven, many of them from war-torn Syria.
The crisis has split the 28-nation European Union (EU). Germany is leading calls to take in more refugees while newer members led by Hungary are opposing plans for mandatory quotas.
Yilmaz said resolving the problem would eventually have a positive impact on global growth and employment.
""Economy and politics are closely related,"" he said.
Turkey is hosting some 1.8 million refugees from the Syrian crisis and has repeatedly accused Europe of failing to pull its weight.
The lifeless body of a three-year-old Syrian boy washed ashore in the Turkish southwest holiday resort of Bodrum this week triggered grief around the world.
The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Christine Lagarde said her organisation would help as much as it could.
""I think it is everybody's concern and everybody's business and it cannot be left to just one country because it happens to be nearby,"" she said.

7a44f28e-2363-4590-abe5-39de2226d88d,Falcons CB Desmond Trufant has much respect for Giants Odell Beckham Jr.,News,ESPN.com,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons cornerback Desmond Trufant has a checklist of things he looks for from a wide receiver, and Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. fits all the criteria. 

""I look at how they release against press [coverage]; are they patient releases, do they just go, or do they try to shake a lot and get you off your spot,"" Trufant said. ""I see if they use their hands to push off. Also, I look at where they try to feed them the ball. Each receiver has certain type of plays where they get the ball. Some guys are screen guys. Some guys are shot [down the field] guys. Some guys are possession guys. 

""I think he fits all of it, really. They like to take shots with him. They'll throw screens to him. I've seen him in the backfield where they threw him a sweep play last year. They definitely are trying to feed him in the ball whenever they can, so you just have to be on your toes. He'll be in the slot. He'll be outside. You definitely have to be aware of where he's at."" 

Falcons coach Dan Quinn hinted at mixing up the coverages against Beckham and maybe matching Trufant against him, depending on down and distance. Trufant shadowed receivers such as Steve Smith, Kelvin Benjamin and Josh Gordon in the past. Beckham, in his second season, has developed into a primary target for Eli Manning , particularly with Victor Cruz sidelined with a calf injury. Beckham had 1,305 yards on 91 catches with 12 touchdowns last year as a rookie, and he played in just 12 games. His debut actually was against the Falcons in Week 5 of last season, when he caught four passes for 44 yards and his first NFL touchdown. 

Trufant addressed the possibility of matching Beckham, who is known for his quickness. 

""I'm fine with whatever,"" Trufant said. ""Whatever we do, I'm with it. Whatever the coaches need me to do, I'm there to do. I'm just going to do whatever my part is; whatever my role. Whatever the ask me to do, I'm going to do it."" 

Trufant was asked if Beckham, who even threw a pass last season, has any weaknesses. 

""Honestly, I just look at my strengths,"" he said. ""He's well-rounded. I really can't say he has a glaring weakness. I just look at my strength and what separates me [speed, technique, confidence]."" 

From watching film, Trufant did pick up on some things other defenders did not do well against Beckhman. 

""I think just playing the ball, because one of the great things that he does is playing the ball in the air,"" Trufant said of Beckham. ""You just have to be in the right position and find the ball. You have to get up first because he can jump. You just have to get up first and go attack the ball."" 

Last week against the Cowboys, Beckham had just 44 receiving yards on five catches. Those were his lowest totals since Week 7 of last season. Dallas played two deep coverage and kept him in front of the as the Giants really never generated their offense. 

Maybe Trufant can help the Falcons have similar type of success against Beckham come Sunday.",547,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Atlanta Falcons cornerback Desmond Trufant has a checklist of things he looks for from a wide receiver, and Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. fits all the criteria.

Some guys",2015-09-17T23:05:19Z," don-t know edge coverage coming into camp because that will be hard unless it's blitzing with everybody yelling underneath zone receivers like five yards down there without worrying who gets hit in return balls so by play setter Hoyer doesn't waste points on corners anymore; nobody knows up field."" The one veteran pass protector Jones struggled was as an elusive safety early last month when Dallas acquired Mack Hollinstone prior Tuesday morning through trading New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady citing league rules prohibiting him having injury protection after being placed out prepping offenses due not using clear cut angles during OTAs led me thinking Jennings is fine ever following Graham until more important players (and/or QBs maybe) decline ill form going 4 this season but every time i'd check ESPN leagues these 5 came today

a0e93707-1aef-4b3f-9772-162de8171519,From the National Weather Service…,News,Bladen Journal,"Hurricane Joaquin became the 2015 Atlantic season’s third hurricane Wednesday morning and hurricane watches and warnings have been issued for the Bahamas while The National Weather Service nervously watches its potential to affect the U.S. East Coast. 
 
An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance aircraft measured sufficiently strong flight-level winds and low surface pressure to prompt the National Hurricane Center to upgrade Joaquin Wednesday morning. The Hurricane Hunters found a 55-mile-wide eye open on its north side. 
 
Hurricane Joaquin continues to intensify slowly, as wind shear — harmful to the intensification of tropical cyclones — lessens, and a complicated atmospheric pattern makes its future track – including any potential landfall on the U.S. East Coast – extremely difficult to forecast. 
 
Residents along the East Coast of the U.S. should pay close attention to the forecast now through this weekend. It’s a particularly difficult forecast that hinges on the behavior of several different atmospheric features over North America and the North Atlantic Ocean. 
 
Computer forecast models – and the meteorologists who rely on them for guidance – are grappling with a complex interaction between Joaquin, a cold front near the East Coast, the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida, a strong bubble of high pressure aloft over the North Atlantic Ocean, and a potentially strong area of low pressure aloft digging into the southeastern U.S. later this week. 
 
Joaquin’s future depends critically on the position and relative strength of those players – not to mention its own strength. Strong wind shear had kept most of Joaquin’s thunderstorm activity (convection) south or east of its center of circulation, but that changed Tuesday afternoon and evening as thunderstorms developed closer to its circulation center. 
 
Joaquin is expected to slowly churn toward the Bahamas Wednesday and Thursday. The extent of the effects on those islands will depend heavily on how close it gets and how much time it spends nearby before making the anticipated northward turn. 
 
Although computer model simulations run Tuesday evening had the advantage of ingesting high-resolution real-world data from the Air Force reconnaissance flight earlier in the day, it doesn’t seem to have brought them any closer to a consensus. 
 
The American GFS model forecast showed Joaquin making an alarming northwestward turn, slamming it right into Virginia and Maryland this weekend. Meanwhile, the European ECMWF model showed Joaquin staying well away from the U.S. East Coast, and eventually curving out into the North Atlantic well off the coasts of New England and Atlantic Canada. 
 
It is simply too soon and the uncertainty is too high to determine any impacts from Joaquin itself for the U.S. East Coast at this time. 
 
Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Joaquin’s path, portions of the East Coast will still see multiple impacts from the evolving large-scale weather pattern, including flooding rainfall, gusty winds, high surf, beach erosion and some coastal flooding.

35aca322-0e03-4e20-b229-4b613f390780,Matthew Wade reiterates Test recall ambitions after strong start in ODI series,News,Murray Valley Standard,"The most decisive early move in the friendly battle to succeed Brad Haddin as Australia's preferred wicketkeeper has come at the start of their one-day series against England, from Matthew Wade. The most decisive early move in the friendly battle to succeed Brad Haddin as Australia's preferred wicketkeeper has come at the start of their one-day series against England, from Matthew Wade. Wade is not expecting to be in consideration for next month's Test tour of Bangladesh, because of the solid performances of Peter Nevill across the last four Ashes Tests. Nevertheless, the Victorian's man-of-the-match performance in Australia's 59-run win over England in the one-day series opener - he made 71 not out from 50 deliveries in Southampton - vindicated selectors' decision to give him first opportunity to be their limited-overs gloveman. Having arrived with Australia precariously placed at 6-193 at the expansive Ageas Bowl, it also reinforced his reputation as a batsman who thrives when his team is struggling.

""I don't know why, but I thrive in that situation,"" said Wade, who shared an unbeaten 112-run partnership with Mitch Marsh which lifted Australia to 6-305.

""My last 12 months in one-day cricket I felt like I've played pretty well when I got picked for the South African tour [at the start of the 2014-15 summer] and then the series before that, where I got picked for a few games [in 2013-14 against England].

""I can look back over the last three or four years and try and tinker with things if I wanted to, but it's more important for me now to really establish myself as a player in the one-day team again.""

Wade briefly held the preferred wicketkeeper role for Australia across all formats for about a year, until the 2013 Ashes when Haddin reclaimed the position. The 27-year-old, who also took three catches against England in Southampton, reiterated his determination to be challenge Nevill for the Test role.

""You can only do it [earn selection] by good performances and if I can put enough of them forward than who knows what's going to happen. But at the moment 'Nev' played pretty well during the Ashes so I'd presume he's probably going to take the gloves in the Bangladesh tour - but that's fine. I'll keep working hard and keep putting good performances forward ... hopefully we can push each other as hard as we can.""

As Wade batted steadily on Thursday his partner, Marsh, struggled to match him for timing and placement - but, significantly for the 23-year-old, fought his way through it better than he did during his lean Ashes series with the bat, to finish unbeaten from 34 deliveries.

""I would have liked to score a few more runs in the Ashes when I had the opportunity,"" said Marsh.

""For me, in a one-day series like this it's not about how many runs I score or how many wickets I take. I just want to do anything for the team to win, and if that means I get 5 off 10 balls at the end or ... 40 not out in a hundred-run partnership with Matthew Wade then I'm happy. I'm not too worried about numbers or making big runs. I just want this team to win. We've got a young group here, so it's going to be really exciting.""

England's promising start to their chase - they were 2-146 at the half-way mark of their innings - was squandered amid a team-wide disciplined bowling performance from Australia. They lost 6-60 in the second half, including a disastrous stint of 3-0 in the space of four deliveries, and were eventually all out for 246.

Wade, who was not part of the Ashes squad, said Australia were rapt the second match of the one-day series would come so soon after the first, a day match at Lord's on Saturday.

""It's nice to win. To get around the team after an Ashes defeat, it's pretty important that the new players coming in to that squad really push the tempo up and try to push training as hard as we could, because it's a long summer when you're here for the whole time - and they had the West Indies before that,"" he said.

""It's nice to win ... especially in a five-game series and it's really back-to-back, all the games. To get a win is really important for us and hopefully we can take the momentum down to London and keep winning.""

995ca359-68c1-4bc3-aec7-c87a704f0394,"Barca hit by injuries, first signs of fan anger",News,Mail Online UK,"BARCELONA, Sept 30 ( ) - Barcelona coach Luis Enrique woke up on Wednesday confronted with the twin problems of a lengthening injury list and the first signs of discontent this season among the demanding fans at the Nou Camp. 

Barca's Spain playmaker and captain Andres Iniesta was the latest to be sidelined, following the likes of Lionel Messi and Rafinha, picking up a thigh muscle strain that local media suggested could keep him out for more than a month. 

To make matters worse, some supporters began whistling the team when they were trailing Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 in Tuesday's Champions League Group E game, although they were soon silenced as Barca stormed back to win 2-1 thanks to late goals from Sergi Roberto and Luis Suarez. 

It may seem incredible that some home fans are angry a mere four months after Barca secured a treble of Champions League, La Liga and King's Cup titles but their performances of late have been less than convincing and supporters in Spain are notoriously impatient. 

Luis Enrique said Barca would remain competitive despite the rash of injuries and hit back at the disgruntled fans, saying the players deserved greater respect. 

""We need more support from people when things aren't going our way,"" Luis Enrique told a news conference. 

""You can clearly hear the whistles from beside the pitch,"" added the former Barca and Spain midfielder. 

""If we are not running enough fine but the team made a big effort. There are going to be players out there (due to the injuries) who need confidence not whistling."" 

One reason Barca have been left short is a FIFA ban on registering players for the past two transfer windows. 

Barca bought Turkey playmaker Arda Turan and versatile Spain midfielder Aleix Vidal in the close season but as things stand neither can play until January. 

Barca have asked permission to register Arda due to Rafinha's long-term knee injury and local media have reported they are prepared to take their fight to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if necessary. 

Tuesday's victory lifted Barca to the top of the section on four points from two matches, with Leverkusen second on three points, level with BATE Borisov. BATE beat AS Roma 3-2 on Tuesday and the Serie A side are bottom on one point. 

Barca's next outing is a La Liga game at Europa League holders Sevilla on Saturday.

46a99b09-7d9b-4cd5-a22d-de4051148f6c,Helping the Poor Financially,News,Champlin-Dayton Press,"Helping people work their way out of poverty isn't just about money. It requires addressing the beliefs and culture around money that may be keeping people stuck both financially and emotionally. 

Like many of my financial planning colleagues, I have an interest in finding effective ways to help middle- and low-income people increase their financial health. One method I've used from time to time is teaching community classes. 

I've offered classes on basic financial skills like managing money or the fundamentals of investing. I've also tried offering classes focused on money scripts – people’s basic, and sometimes fallacious, beliefs on the subject – or other aspects of money psychology. Guess which classes fill and which ones don't?   

No matter what their income level, people tend to shy away from looking at the relationship between money and emotions. There seems to be a widespread money script of: ""More financial knowledge is all I need in order to have more money."" Yet I've seen time and time again over the years that this simply is not true. 

Helping low-income people increase their financial literacy is a start, but it isn't enough. This was confirmed for me recently, at the annual Financial Therapy Association meeting, when I heard a talk that Louis Barajas gave. A noted author and expert on giving financial advice to lower-income people, he said, ""All the financial literacy in the world is not going to help the poor."" 

Born into a poor family in East Los Angeles, Louis managed to become the first Hispanic certified financial planner in the U.S. and pull himself out of poverty. After a successful career, he returned to the barrio to live his passion of helping his community transcend poverty. It turned out to be far more challenging than he ever dreamed. 

As Louis said in his talk, he discovered that, ""Most people in poverty are unaware that their cultural beliefs hold them back."" He described some of those beliefs, which I call money scripts. A few of them are: 
A sense of fatalism, that ""this is just how things will be."" An assumption that working for someone else is the only option. A group dynamic where anyone who reaches for too much success is pulled back down into the community's financial comfort zone. A victim mentality of blaming and feeling powerless to change. Relying for financial advice on the wealthiest or most successful person in the neighborhood, without the knowledge to evaluate the validity of that advice.  
Barajas has found that telling someone about a better way doesn’t work. He had to find how to expose them to it. As he said, ""If you don’t see a brighter future, you won’t plan."" But even before that, people need help to take care of their urgent needs first before they can even consider that a future exists. 

Hearing Barajas's talk only confirmed for me how important it is to consider people's beliefs and emotions about money. This is essential knowledge for financial advisors, debt counselors, social workers, volunteers and anyone working to help people get out of poverty. More money or more knowledge about money is simply not enough to help people who seem stuck in poverty or in a repeated pattern of financial missteps. 

The easiest way to advise people who are struggling financially is to focus on the mechanics of managing money. Yet anyone who really wants to help people make lasting changes in their money behavior needs to find ways to help them look deeper. Ironically, the need to look beyond the money to build financial health is one important thing the poor and the wealthy have in common.

e26c4f5f-6977-4c05-b1f7-340e17c63914,Mismanaged student debt causing relationship tension,News,Sunday Star-Times,"Can your love survive the bills? 
             
It may be too tricky a topic of conversation for a first date, but the burden of student debt can prove to be a serious obstacle to young love. 
 
Around 83 per cent of students expect to be in debt by the time they graduate, according to New Zealand's Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA), and the legacy lasts into young adulhood and beyond. 
 
Which poses the question - when should someone come clean about how much they owe to a potential romantic partner?  
 
All borrowings can have an impact on relationships and debt should be readily discussed, said financial advisor from the Professional Advisors Association, Sheryl Sutherland. 
 
""If you can't talk about money before you are in a relationship you sure will have problems talking about it once you are,"" Sutherland said. 
 
""The old adage is true. Money and, or sex are the cause of most break-ups."" 
 
She said although it's wise to pay loans off quickly there were other issues for couples, such as saving for a home deposit or paying down debt with higher interest. 
 
Dunedin student Danielle Blyde admitted her former partner's carefree approach to student debt was enough to call their relationship quits. 
 
She said the stress of managing student debt, and her partner's attitude towards money, led to the break-down. 
 
""Both of us were looking at our individual debts which were both rapidly increasing. We couldn't see a future together without money stress,"" Blyde said. 
 
But the film and media student said it was their different approaches to student debt which caused tension between them. 
 
Blyde said that whilst her ex-partner's parents covered his weekly rent, he still chose to loan the full living costs.  
 
""I was forced to borrow the full amount, but I wasn't able to spend it on whatever I wanted. It had to go on bills and food every week. 
 
""For me, seeing him spend money which technically wasn't income was really stressful and did strain the relationship. It was debt accumulating on essentially nothing,"" Blyde said. 
 
Similar to many students living away from home, Blyde expects her current debt balance of $39,000 to reach $52,000 by the time she leaves university. 
 
And this figure does not include repayments she has already made from scholarships, holiday work and voluntary contributions. 
 
""I am very aware of money and future plans. I think that anyone I end up with would need to have a similar mind set,"" Blyde said. 
 
Fashion design student at Wellington's Massey University, Michaela Bloxham, said because paper fees are processed directly between the university and Studylink, many students are not taking notice of the costs. 
 
""Students consider their loans as free money at the moment, so you spend it on whatever you think you need. In reality it's more on what you want,"" Bloxham said. 
 
Bloxham said although they discuss loans with peers,it is often not mentioned in relationships. 
 
""I guess at the end of study, you would want to think about it more seriously. 
    
""What your loan is, and how that is going to affect you going overseas and your future obviously. It's a lot to pay off,"" Bloxham said. 
 
Borrowers who choose to work overseas are required to pay standard interest rates six months after leaving New Zealand. 
 
""For me I've always considered that I would like to live overseas as soon as I've finished studying, but obviously it's not that feasible when you both have student loans,"" Bloxham said. 
 
For many couples out of university, their total student loans are often not balanced. 
 
Career and life coach Allison Fisher, said personal debt should be addressed before it creates division. 
 
""The partner who has the debt needs to take responsibility as to what they are going to do to pay it off. Then the other person really has to accept and not resent it,"" Fisher said. 
 
Fisher said that going into relationships with large student loans is something people have not had in the past. 
 
""It's another factor to take into account when living now, another complication,"" Fisher said. 
 
Melissa Clark doesn't think there is any shame in disclosing a student loan as it now a ""reality of life"". 
 
""I think the worst thing that you could probably do is to not capitalise on your degree and take a job on a lower wage,"" Clark said. 
 
Clark, 40, said her close friend struggled to save up for a house deposit because of her student debt, and also pushed back having children. 
 
""As a couple we had zero and they had $40,000 owing, and it was enough to prevent her getting a mortgage. 
 
""It didn't destroy her relationship. But it's made that much difference between the two of us,"" Clark said.   
 
 Hand over the money honey  
 
Most marriages have prenups to split relationship property. 
 
But financial advisors are suggesting couples enter a contracting-out agreement early to avoid acquiring student debt. 
 
Moneymax financial advisor, Liz Koh, advises couples to do a contracting out agreement for any relationship that may be permanent. 
 
This agreement allows couples to opt-out of equal-sharing rules under the Property (Relationships) Act and determine their own agreement. 
 
""It needs to be really clear who is responsible for what and if the relationship ends how many of the debts do you take with you and how many of the assets,"" Koh said. 
 
The agreement could allow individuals to keep their own existing assets and maintain responsibility for their own debts. 
 
Although there is no ""hard and fast rule"" Koh said couples should discuss student debts before three years when the ""relationship act kicks in"". 
 
If couple's have no agreement after 3 years together, total relationship property minus any debts are divided equally between the couple.  
 
The community law manual states that deciding whether student loans are personal debt or relationship debts is decided on a case by case basis.

The Utah Division of Emergency Management said in a Facebook post that heavy rains caused the flash flooding at about 5 p.m. local time Monday in Hildale, approximately 315 miles south of Salt Lake City. The statement said a “large wall of water and debris” smashed into the vehicles, washing them and their occupants downstream.   The women and children were in two different cars, a full size van and an SUV, on a gravel road north of the towns, Hildale assistant fire chief Kevin Barlow said. It appears they were coming back from a park in the area, backing their cars up when the flash flood hit, he said. The flood “obviously caught these people off guard,” Barlow told The Associated Press. “Witnesses say they were backing out of it trying to get away from it and it still swept them in.” The statement said there were 16 people in the vehicles. In addition to the dead and missing, authorities said the other three people had been rescued. One survivor was found downstream at a bank in town. Barlow said the rescue effort was ongoing through the night but scaled back because of treacherous conditions in Hildale and its sister town, Colorado City, Ariz., Barlow said. Full-scale efforts were scheduled to resume at daybreak. Fox 13 Now reported that three of the victims were mothers and one of the other victims was a 4-year-old. The floods came after heavy rains fell in the canyons just north of town, sending waves of water barreling through the streets of the community of 7,700 people that is the home base of a polygamous sect run by Warren Jeffs. The National Weather Service (NWS) said Monday that flash flooding in the Hildale area had resulted in overturned cars and flood damage along State Route 59. The flooding has also impacted several areas in the Colorado City and Hildale communities including flooded homes and streets and power outages. The NWS had issued a flash flood warning earlier in the day, leading nearby Zion National Park to close all slot canyons as a precaution. Barlow said he doesn’t know if residents were aware of the warning. He said water rises 1 to 1 1/2 feet at normal flood stage. “This was several feet deep, at least, and even more treacherous in the narrow channels.” The flooding also caused other, less serious problems. Barlow said several blocks of home are without power and water due to the flooding. “We’re pretty used to flash flooding,” Barlow said, “but this is significantly more than what we’re used to.” The National Weather Service is forecasting scattered rain and thunderstorms Tuesday in the area. The community is a patchwork of upscale, elegant residences surrounded by large walls and unfinished, dilapidated houses that remain just as they were in the early 2000s, when Jeffs ordered that all construction stop in Utah to focus on building his compound in Texas.

Shareholders of record as of July 28 will be allowed to cast votes on the merger plans. As a result, Charter is organizing a similar, separate vote that same day.

More from Forbes:
Time Warner Cable and Charter had announced last May that they had entered into a definitive agreement to merge. Charter is a leading internet communications company and the fourth-largest cable operator in the U.S. The deal values Time Warner Cable’s stock at $195.71/share, which gives the company an enterprise value of $78.7 billion. Charter will provide $100 in cash and the rest in shares of a new public parent company, tentatively called “New Charter,” for each Time Warner Cable share outstanding. Charter had earlier agreed to buy Bright House Networks and the Syracuse-based company will also be a part of New Charter. The deal is currently under review by the FCC and the companies expect the deal to close by the end of the year.

Time Warner Cable’s stock gained around 1% over the week through Thursday. We currently have a price estimate of $198 for Time Warner Cable. For the year 2015, we estimate revenues of $23.7 billion, in line with the consensus estimate, and EPS of $6.86, compared to a consensus estimate of $6.61.

A field at the Garick Park baseball/softball complex along Boardman Road is the site of the original diamond cut in the 1950s for Little League games. 
 Photo: File Photo Back to Gallery 
      
NEW MILFORD — A recent survey of town land showed there are plenty of options available for sports fields. 
 
That’s good news since Garick Farms owners are likely in the next year to reclaim property on Boardman Road that has been used by the town’s youth baseball and softball teams. 
 
A committee, which was formed last year when Garick Farms first discussed possibly taking back the land, presented to the Town Council on Monday night a recent survey of potential athletic field sites. 
 
Committee member Tom Pilla said it might be in New Milford’s best interest to create a sports campus with town-owned athletic fields in one easily accessed area. He recommended Kimberly-Clark-owned land on 280 Kent Road (Route 7) to replace the Boardman Road fields along with the construction of other athletic fields for soccer, field hockey and other sports. 
 
“When we look at the town, there is a lot of opportunity for sports field expansion,” Pilla said. “The town has been exceptional in maintaining its fields. A lot of fields are already being used to their full potential. And a lot of young families would like the youth league ball fields moved from Boardman Road because of parking safety issues. Many would also like to see a sports campus in the town.” 
 
There are 16 field locations in New Milford. Work has recently been completed on two of those field locations — Baldwin Park and Helen Marx Park. 
 
Baldwin Park, 25 Hipp Road, has had the parking area expanded and roadway to the park graded to make the location more accessible. It has two soccer/field hockey fields in good condition. There is potential to install one more soccer field and two baseball fields, Pilla said. 
 
Helen Marx Park, 91 Housatonic Ave., has two Little League fields. The two fields were recently refurbished and there were also drainage improvements done on the southern field. The combined outfields are being used for flag football and soccer. 
 
At Clattery Valley, 158 Old Town Road, parking needs to be expanded for its existing two soccer/field hockey fields — both in good condition. 
 
Fields at New Milford High School and Hill & Plain School have no available room for additional recreational use.

On Pickett District Road, the Kimberly-Clark property offers two softball fields and two soccer/field hockey fields in good condition that are used by the town. 
 
At Pickett District Park, 189 Pickett District Road, there are four Little League fields in fair to good condition, but parking and the access to the road need maintenance. 
 
Other sports fields exist at Northville School and Schaghticoke Middle School on Hipp Road and Sarah Noble School on Sunny Valley Road. At Northville, two soccer/field hockey fields are in need of minor regrading, while the lower area is too wet for reasonable use for athletics, Pilla said. 
 
At Schaghticoke Middle School, there is one soccer/field hockey field and one baseball field, both in good condition. 
 
Sarah Noble School, the former high school, has an abandoned full-size Little League field in the front that needs to be reconstructed, a grass area adjacent to the abandoned field used for soccer, and the southern portion of the campus has potential for two additional Little League fields and could also be used for soccer/field hockey. 
 
At Young’s Field, there are two adult softball fields and a large, undedicated recreational area.

Total advisory solutions assets rose by $83 billion during the quarter on net new flows of $63 billion, with all market segments recording increases. The continued momentum in Unified Managed Accounts (UMA) can be attributed to advisors and investors taking advantage of the benefits of consolidating different product sleeves in a single custodial account. 
 

 Investment Advisory Solutions Assets Rise 2% to $4.2 Billion in Volatile Second Quarter  
New Net Flows of $63 Billion for the Three-Month Period 
 
WASHINGTON, D.C., September 21, 2015 – The Money Management Institute (MMI), the national association representing the $4.2 trillion investment advisory solutions (IAS) and wealth management industry, today released MMI Central 3Q 2015, which provides a statistical overview of data and trends for the advisory solutions industry for the second quarter of 2015. 
 
Highlights of this edition include: 
  Despite a quarter marked by substantial volatility in the global equity and fixed-income markets, investment advisory solutions assets rose 2% to $4.2 trillion, continuing a steady rise dating back to the end of the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The 2% increase outpaced the S&P 500 Index, which posted a 0.3% gain during the quarter.    For the fourth consecutive quarter, Unified Managed Accounts (UMAs) recorded the largest increase in assets, rising by 6%. Rep as Portfolio Manager again finished second with a 3% gain followed by smaller increases in Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) at 2%, and Rep as Advisor – a non-discretionary, fee-based advisory option – and Mutual Fund Advisory programs, both at 1%.    One-year IAS asset growth of 11% through June 2015 bettered the 7% gain in the S&P 500 Index. Here too UMA (46%) and Rep as Portfolio Manager (17%) were the leading segments while SMA Advisory, Rep as Advisor and Mutual Fund Advisory lagged both the overall IAS industry and equity markets with gains for the trailing year of 6%, 5% and 5%, respectively. The longer-term UMA growth trend is an indication that some of the steam is being taken out of SMA and Mutual Fund Advisory programs, as advisors increasingly see the benefits of consolidating various sleeves in one custodial account.    Total IAS net flows continued strong at $63 billion for the second quarter, up $3 billion over the preceding quarter. Rep as Portfolio Manager net flows of $28 billion led all segments and was followed by UMA Advisory with a healthy $18 billion in flows. SMA Advisory programs were also relatively strong for the quarter with net flows of $11 billion. Mutual Fund Advisory posted net flows of $5.5 billion while Rep as Advisor was barely in positive territory with net flows of less than $1 billion.    The aggregate trailing four-quarter net flows for the second quarter of 2015 were $267 billion, just $1 billion ahead of the trailing one-year flows for the second quarter of 2014.    Rep as Portfolio Manager, with $959 billion in assets, continues to steadily edge closer to the $1 trillion mark, which only Mutual Fund Advisory has surpassed. While UMA Advisory outpaces Rep as Portfolio Manager on a percentage basis in quarter-over-quarter asset growth, it does so off an asset base just less than half the size of Rep as Portfolio Manager. The real growth story is to be found in the trailing flow data over the past three years which Rep as Portfolio Manager dominates.

  Among major industry segments, the 2% growth in IAS assets in the second quarter compares to an approximate 5% increase for Exchange-Traded Funds, a 2% gain for Long-Term Mutual Funds, and a 1% decline for Money Market Funds.   
MMI Sponsor Firm Survey: A Snapshot of Progress toward Goals-Based Wealth Management 
 
The 2015-2016 MMI Industry Guide to Investment Advisory Solutions , which will be released in late October, includes an annual industry forecast derived from a survey of senior executives at sponsor firms. This year’s survey posed questions about sponsor firms’ commitment to and progress on the transition to goals-based wealth management (GBWM). Among the survey highlights: 
  GBWM continues to gain traction, and it is clear that it has become a priority among sponsor firms. An overwhelming proportion of respondents (89%) indicated that GBWM is now an important initiative at their firms.  When asked to project the proportion of their firms’ accounts that will transition to GBWM over the next five years, the responses were highly optimistic with a roughly fourfold increase – from the current 10% to 38% – predicted at the end of five years. 88% of executives surveyed indicated that their firms were investing a moderate to significant amount in GBWM, but 89% of those same executives thought that their firms’ spending on GBWM wasn’t adequate and should be increased.  GBWM-related investments are being put to work in a number of ways. Sponsor firms are beginning to put in place the infrastructure – including planning tools, platform software and other technologies – needed to deliver GBWM.  Most of the current initiatives focus on the front end of the advice delivery process because front-end planning is the first step in implementing a goals-based process, planning modules and interface improvements are likely to drive near-term revenue growth, and converting the front end to GBWM reorients both the client and the financial advisor.

Making the perfect har gow is a fine art. The prawn-meat filling needs to be mixed and chopped to exactly the right consistency; the dough encasing it should be translucent but robust enough to hold the heavy little parcel together and not break when picked up with chopsticks; and the amount of meat should be generous, yet small enough that it can still be eaten in one bite.

What really separates the experts from the amateurs, however, is folding and pleating the dumplings. The best har gow have at least nine, and ideally 13 even pleats.

I'm in a dumpling-making class at The Peninsula Hong Kong under the tutelage of dumpling master Fong Li Hing. With his team of chefs, Chef Fong hand makes 1000 perfect dumplings each day that are served in the hotel's acclaimed Cantonese restaurant, Spring Moon. Neil Perry, arguably Australia's best-known chef, is my classmate. Call me competitive, but I'm completely delighted to note that I pleat a better har gow than him.

Perry, who has two Chinese eateries in his restaurant empire, is unfazed. ""I don't have to be good at it. I have dumpling experts who work for me.""

This is the first day of an exclusive tour of some of Perry's favourite food haunts in Hong Kong. We are about to learn how the city and its food have influenced Perry's restaurants, cookbooks and the inflight menu he designs for Qantas.

At Seventh Son (www.seventhson.hk) in Wan Chai on our first night, we're treated to a feast in 17 courses, with impeccably cooked Cantonese classics plus a few surprises. The reason most people come to Seventh Son, Perry tells us, is for its suckling pig. The dish lives up to its reputation, with skin so crisp it snaps like a cracker and meat that is tender, sweet and juicy. It's followed by chicken baked in rock salt. With golden, crunchy, salty skin, it immediately assumes its place as one of the two best roast chicken dishes I've ever eaten – and both were in Hong Kong.

Our host, director Daniel Chui, regales us with stories of his family (who originally ran the famous Fook Lam Moon restaurants) and of his passion for ""sustainability"" in food production. Educated in the US, he's a vegetarian and our menu includes variations on classic Cantonese dishes where vegetables replace proteins.

We love hipster hangout Ho Lee Fuk (www.holeefookhk.tumblr.com ) in a Central basement, where Taiwanese-born, Sydney-trained chef Jowett Yu (who worked at Ms G's and Mr Wong) is rattling the woks. A wall of golden waving cats adds a pop-art feel to the entrance opposite the open kitchen. The menu is said to be inspired by the old school Hong Kong cha chaan teng (tea restaurants), with standout dishes including the roast wagyu short ribs served with fiery jalapeno puree, green shallot kimchi and soy glaze. Yu has adapted his mum's recipe for ""Mostly Cabbage, Little Bit of Pork"" dumplings, and the menu is complemented by an eclectic wine list that includes some interesting Japanese sakes.

The team behind the popular eatery are young expat entrepreneurs who run, among other ventures, Chom Chom (www.chomchom.hk), a Vietnamese-style bia hoi bar just across the street. We perch on upturned milk crates sipping themed cocktails such as the Pho-jito, made with rum, lemongrass, lime and mint, and a refreshing whisky-based Tamarind Sour. The neighbourhood, known as Soho (SOuth of HOllywood Road) is buzzing as drinkers and diners hop between the funky hole-in-the-wall establishments that line the narrow streets.

Aesthetics and design are phenomenally important to Hong Kong's new breed of restaurateurs. The eclectic fitout at Mott 32 (www.mott32.com) beneath an office block in Central celebrates Hong Kong culture and history. One wall is artfully decorated in traditional paint brushes. Service is a bit hit-and-miss, some dishes are under-seasoned and I can't help feeling it's style over substance, until we tuck into a textbook sweet and sour pork, the tangy sauce just lightly coating the meat. ""It's perfect,"" Perry says. ""So often it's swimming in sauce."" Any reservations are banished for good when we taste the char siu, made from acorn-fed Spanish iberico pork. Marinated and barbecued, char siu is one of Canton's great gifts to the culinary world and Mott 32's sweet, nutty version is sublime.

Perry leads us through the wet markets of Central. Nestled among the butchers, fishmongers and fruit and veg stalls, are dai pai dongs, family-run, open-air street food stalls, with steaming cauldrons of soup and baskets of noodles that go into it. Once ubiquitous, they are slowly disappearing as the younger generations choose not to follow in their parents' footsteps and the licences lapse.

At the market stalls, Perry gets excited by the possibilities of ingredients we don't see every day at home: straw mushrooms, bitter melon and other gourds, snake beans and ginger, both young and old, which, he explains, local chefs use for different purposes.

Lung King Heen at the Four Seasons Hotel (www.fourseasons.com/hongkong) is the world's first Chinese restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars and arguably the finest restaurant in the city. There's a three-month waiting list, so book well in advance.

Everything about Lung King Heen is stunning, from the view over Victoria Harbour to Kowloon, to the exquisite table settings. But it's the food that really impresses; wines from China, Korea and Taiwan and a Japanese Junmai Daiginjo Genshu sake are matched to each course. A single shrimp and crabmeat dumpling is served in its own individual steamer basket and topped with edible gold leaf. It's followed by a pair of dumplings, one with duck liver, scallop and vegetables, the other a classy xiao long bao, or Shanghai dumpling, filled with prawn, crab and a scalding aromatic broth.

The abalone coated with delicate jelly in the lightest puff pastry shell is the epitome of status-driven Cantonese cooking, but dish of the day is a single crab and black truffle spring roll, the pastry so fine it shatters on the tongue and dissolves in the mouth, the filling earthy but sweet.

We return to more traditional fare, including blackened, jellied century eggs, at Yung Kee (www.yungkee.com.hk), in the heart of Central, which has been run by generations of the same family for 70 years. Roast goose is the house specialty, the bird with its dark caramelised skin served head and all, with wings splayed, as if it's just flown in and flopped on to the plate.

Even in this most traditional of Cantonese eateries, where shark's fin is served eight ways, there is a nod to progression and global trends. One of their most popular dumplings is a delicious vegetarian morsel stuffed with pumpkin, kale and quinoa, unlikely proof that, in the right hands, superfoods and Cantonese cooking can be a perfect match. The floors above the restaurant are home to the exclusive Kee Club, with a hip vibe, and frequented by Hong Kong's bright and beautiful, expat ladies who lunch, glamorous young professionals and creative types.

I try to draw Perry on the best dishes of the trip, but he doesn't like to single out one or two of the 70 or more we've eaten. ""Why can't they all be favourites?"" he says. ""Why do I have to nominate just one. It's like asking a parent which is your favourite child."" His passion and enthusiasm for Cantonese food is evident in every morsel gleefully stuffed into his mouth.

Indeed, for a chef who spends so much time in kitchens, he still gets excited about exploring other restaurants' kitchens and sampling their food. His response is simple: ""If you love it, you love it."" TRIP NOTESMORE INFORMATION

MASSENA — Leading up to National Bullying Awareness Month in October, award-winning children’s music performer Eric Herman will be bringing an anti-bullying program to the Massena Central School District. 

Superintendent Patrick H. Brady told board of education members that Mr. Herman would be leading an assembly Monday afternoon at Madison Elementary School, which would be attended by fifth- and sixth-grade students from all three of the district’s elementary schools. 

“It’s called ‘Bully Schmully.’ That’s one of the things that we’re doing (to address anti-bullying),” Mr. Brady said. 

According to Mr. Herman’s website, the presentation, which was inspired by psychologist Izzy Kalman’s “Bullies 2 Buddies” method, focuses on helping the victims of bullying by giving them the tools they need to approach and respond to situations of criticism and mockery with tact and humor. Bullying and cyberbullying affect approximately one of six students across the country. 

“This not only empowers them to be more self-confident and diplomatic, but also deflates the would-be effect of the critic or bully,” the website notes. 

Mr. Brady said administrators at J.W. Leary Junior High School are also planning to bring in a speaker in the future. 

In addition to bringing in presenters, he said Massena Central High School has a Link Crew program that pairs juniors and seniors up with freshmen, in part to assist them if they encounter bullying. J.W. Leary Junior High School has a similar program called WEB (Where Everybody Belongs) Crew. 

Mr. Brady said the district has initiatives such as the “bully box” in each school, where students can drop off tips about bullying taking place. There’s also an online bullying hotline on the district’s website to report incidents. 

Board member Paul A. Haggett wondered how effective the “bully box” and bullying hotline had been, and administrators said they are being used. 

“Our Bully Boxes get used. The messages are taken out and addressed by the counselor or me. They’re handled the way they should be handled,” Nightengale Elementary Principal Amy Hornung said. 

Jefferson Elementary Principal Duane Richards said that school’s “bully box” initially had been in the main office, but was moved to the nurse’s office where there’s less traffic. That has brought an increase in the number of incidents reported, he said. 

“I think that’s a prime example of a positive-type thing that can be put out there,” Mr. Haggett said.
