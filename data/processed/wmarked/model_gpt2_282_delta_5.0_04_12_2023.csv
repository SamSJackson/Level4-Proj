(Photo by Sue Sturgis/Institute for Southern Studies.)NC communities facing coal ash dangers unite for action When a pipe collapsed at a Duke Energy coal plant in North Carolina last year, sending tens of thousands of tons of toxic coal ash and millions of gallons of contaminated water into the Dan River, the public outcry over the environmental disaster forced the state legislature to take action. It passed the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014, which requires Duke — a monopoly utility that provides electricity to most of the state — to phase out the massive ponds it has traditionally used to store the waste, all of which are leaking pollution to the environment. But many environmental advocates and residents of communities affected by coal ash pollution have raised concerns that the legislation doesn't go far enough to prevent further contamination. At the same time, Duke's planned approach to the problem — excavating wet coal ash from existing power plant sites, drying it and dumping it into landfills elsewhere — puts other communities at risk. This week some of those concerned citizens gathered at the state legislature to announce the formation of a new group called Alliance of Carolinians Together (ACT) Against Coal Ash. The statewide group plans to press Duke Energy, the legislature and the administration of Gov. Pat McCrory (R) for permanent, safe solutions that protect all communities. The effort has support from larger environmental advocacy groups including Appalachian Voices, the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League, Clean Water for North Carolina and NC WARN. ""We are demanding that the lives of citizens be put ahead of corporate profits and greed,"" said Bobby Jones, a resident of Goldsboro and an activist with the grassroots Down East Coal Ash Coalition. He called on state leaders to ""hear the voices of the people, not the talk of money."" To date, over 300 families living near Duke coal ash ponds across North Carolina have been notified by the state that their water is unsafe to drink. Larry Mathis, a resident of Belmont, lives near the massive coal ash ponds at Duke's Allen plant as well as an unlined landfill containing nearly 280,000 tons of coal ash. His community's well tested 28.6 times higher for hexavalent chromium — a known carcinogen — than state standards allow. Duke Energy is currently providing Mathis' community with bottled water for drinking, but they use well water for everything else. ""Try bathing in contaminated water, washing clothes and dishes in contaminated water,"" he said. ""And we're paying for it."" Other speakers talked about unusual patterns of illness in their communities near coal ash ponds, and some raised concerns about what would happen once Duke began dumping coal ash in landfills near their homes. Tracey Edwards, who has lived all her life near Duke's coal ash ponds in Belews Creek and is active with Stokes County Residents for Coal Ash Cleanup, pointed to widespread health problems there, including cancers, strokes, and respiratory and neurological issues. ""I'm really tired of going to funerals,"" Edwards said. While the alliance is not offering a specific recommendation at this time for how coal ash should be stored, members oppose simply capping the existing unlined coal ash ponds, noting that this approach fails to protect groundwater supplies from contamination. Some of the activists said they favored what's known as the ""saltstone process,"" which locks the contaminants into concrete stored onsite. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release its recommendations for best coal ash management practices before the year's end.

696264,1c7639b8-f306-4e07-8ed7-41534bf3c43d,"9/2/15 - Newly Approved EpiduoÂ® Forte adapalene and benzoyl peroxide Gel, 0.3%/2.5% Prescription Treatment Now Available for Acne Patients Nationwide",Pharmacy Choice,"By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Biotech Week  Galderma Laboratories, L.P. announced that Epiduo Forte (adapalene and benzoyl peroxide) Gel, 0.3%/2.5%, is now available in retail pharmacies nationwide and in Puerto Rico. It was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the once-daily, topical treatment of acne vulgaris (see also Galderma Laboratories, L.P.). 
 
This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150817005480/en/ 
 
Epiduo Forte Gel offers patients and physicians a unique treatment that combines two antibiotic-free medicines in one gel and is proven to control moderate to severe inflammatory acne. Left untreated, inflammatory acne may lead to long-term, skin-health issues including scarring. With the highest-available concentration of the retinoid adapalene combined with benzoyl peroxide, Epiduo Forte Gel helps treat moderate to severe inflammatory acne, by reducing the inflammation and redness associated with acne, and by unclogging pores and killing bacteria under the skin. Epiduo Forte Gel can help to simplify the management of hard-to-treat acne, being a 2-in-1 combination product that comes in an easy to use pump for the treatment of acne on the face, chest, back or shoulders. 
 
""Acne, the most common skin condition in the United States, can have a wide-ranging negative impact on those with moderate to severe disease. Patients with significant acne suffer both emotionally, as it contributes to low self-esteem and depression, and physically, due to permanent physical scarring,"" said Jonathan S. Weiss, MD, a board certified dermatologist at Gwinnett Dermatology, P.C., Galderma consultant and leading clinical investigator for the phase 3 trials of Epiduo Forte Gel. ""I am confident that the availability of Epiduo Forte Gel will provide relief for patients, as it is the first combination of these strengths of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide developed to treat moderate to severe inflammatory acne."" 
 
The approval of Epiduo Forte Gel was based on a pivotal phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in which it met each of its primary efficacy endpoints when compared to placebo gel in 217 acne subjects. The study demonstrated superiority of Epiduo Forte Gel over placebo gel (33.7% vs 11.0%) in the overall study population (moderate to severe) at week 12 for the Investigator's Global Assessment Success Rate and for changes in inflammatory (-68.7% vs -39.2%) and non-inflammatory lesion count (-68.3% vs -37.3%, respectively) (all P < .001). Additionally, subjects who were ""severe"" at baseline (50%) were required to go from ""severe"" to ""clear"" or ""almost clear"" within the 12-week trial to be considered a treatment success. More than half of study subjects treated with Epiduo Forte Gel reported a marked improvement in their severe acne (50.5%). 
 
In the pivotal study of subjects with moderate to severe acne, Epiduo Forte Gel results were seen as early as one week, and more than 90 percent of subjects reported complete, significant or moderate improvement in their acne by week 12. Epiduo Forte Gel was shown to be safe, well tolerated, and can be considered for long-term use. Some study subjects (=1%) experienced skin irritation, eczema, atopic dermatitis and skin burning sensation while using Epiduo Forte Gel. 
 
""At Galderma, we recognize the impact that acne has on various aspects of patients' lives and we are committed to ensure all acne sufferers have suitable treatment options available by expanding our robust acne franchise,"" said Todd Zavodnick, President and General Manager of Galderma Laboratories, L.P. ""The availability of Epiduo Forte Gel provides moderate to severe acne patients with a safe, effective and antibiotic-free treatment option and also underscores Galderma's commitment to combat antibiotic resistance and acne simultaneously."" 
 
Additional information on Epiduo Forte Gel can be found in the full prescribing information and important safety information at www.epiduoforte.com. About Acne Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, affecting more than 40 to 50 million people. Acne appears when pores clog with dead skin cells, and can have a wide-ranging negative impact on sufferers that includes both emotional and physical scars. Studies show that many people who have acne suffer from low self-esteem and depression, and that teens who believe they have ""bad"" acne were more likely to think about hurting themselves. Acne not only affects teenagers but also can be seen in men and women of all ages with research showing that the onset of acne is frequently seen in prepubescent patients. 
 
When it comes to acne treatment, long-term use of antibiotics may be a contributing factor to the overall global antibiotic resistance issue. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a bacteria linked to acne, is increasingly becoming resistant to topical and oral antibiotics, which may potentially cause a decrease in treatment efficacy against acne. About Galderma Dating back to 1961, Galderma is now present in 80 countries with an extensive product portfolio to treat a range of dermatological conditions. The company partners with health care professionals around the world to meet the skin health needs of people throughout their lifetime. Galderma is a leader in research and development of scientifically-defined and medically-proven solutions for the skin, hair and nails.

Our reports deliver fact-based news of research and discoveries from around the world.",1076,"inflammatory acne may lead to long-term, skin-health issues including scarring. With the highest-available concentration of the retinoid adapalene combined with benzoyl peroxide, Epiduo Forte Gel helps treat moderate to severe inflammatory acne, by reducing the inflammation and redness associated with acne, and by unclogging pores and killing bacteria under the skin. Epiduo Forte Gel can help to simplify the management of hard-to-treat acne, being a 2-in-1 combination product that comes in an easy to use pump for the treatment of acne on the face, chest, back or shoulders. ""Acne, the most common skin condition in the United States, can have a wide-ranging negative impact on those with moderate to severe disease. Patients with significant acne suffer both emotionally, as it contributes to low self-esteem and depression, and physically, due to permanent physical scarring,"" said Jonathan S. Weiss, MD, a board certified dermatologist at Gwinnett Dermatology, P.C., Galderma consultant and leading clinical investigator for the phase 3 trials of Epiduo Forte Gel. ""I am confident that the availability of Epiduo Forte Gel will provide relief for patients, as it is the first combination of these strengths of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide developed to treat moderate to severe inflammatory acne."" The approval of Epiduo Forte Gel was based on a pivotal phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in which it met each of its primary efficacy endpoints when compared to placebo gel in 217 acne subjects. The study demonstrated superiority of Epiduo Forte Gel over placebo gel (33.7% vs 11.0%) in the overall study population (moderate to severe) at week 12 for the Investigator's Global Assessment Success Rate and for changes in inflammatory (-68.7% vs -39.2%) and non-inflammatory lesion count (-68.3% vs -37.3%, respectively) (all P < .001). Additionally, subjects who were ""severe"" at baseline (50%) were required to go from ""severe"" to ""clear"" or ""almost clear"" within the 12-week trial to be considered a treatment success. More than half of study subjects treated with Epiduo Forte Gel reported a marked improvement in their severe acne (50.5%). In the pivotal study of subjects with moderate to severe acne, Epiduo Forte Gel results were seen as early as one week, and more than 90 percent of subjects reported complete, significant or moderate improvement in their acne by week 12. Epiduo Forte Gel was shown to be safe, well tolerated, and can be considered for long-term use. Some study subjects (=1%) experienced skin irritation, eczema, atopic dermatitis and skin burning sensation while using Epiduo Forte Gel. ""At Galderma, we recognize the impact that acne has on various aspects of patients' lives and we are committed to ensure all acne sufferers have suitable treatment options available by expanding our robust acne franchise,"" said Todd Zavodnick, President and General Manager of Galderma Laboratories, L.P. ""The availability of Epiduo Forte Gel provides moderate to severe acne patients with a safe, effective and antibiotic-free treatment option and also underscores Galderma's commitment to combat antibiotic resistance and acne simultaneously."" Additional information on Epiduo Forte Gel can be found in the full prescribing information and important safety information at www.epiduoforte.com. About Acne Acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, affecting more than 40 to 50 million people. Acne appears when pores clog with dead skin cells, and can have a wide-ranging negative impact on sufferers that includes both emotional and physical scars. Studies show that many people who have acne suffer from low self-esteem and depression, and that teens who believe they have ""bad"" acne were more likely to think about hurting themselves. Acne not only affects teenagers but also can be seen in men and women of all ages with research showing that the onset of acne is frequently seen in prepubescent patients. When it comes to acne treatment, long-term use of antibiotics may be a contributing factor to the overall global antibiotic resistance issue. Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a bacteria linked to acne, is increasingly becoming resistant to topical and oral antibiotics, which may potentially cause a decrease in treatment efficacy against acne.

388904,830b3d37-f82c-490a-9278-3d168a8c23d1,Deception by A.S. Fenichel,Cate Masters,"Deception The Demon Hunters Book 2 A.S. Fenichel Genre: Historical PNR Publisher: Kensington/Lyrical Date of Publication: July 7, 2015 Number of pages: 232 Word Count: 78,957 Cover Artist: Morgan Pielli Book Description: When Demons threaten Regency London, only a Lady can stop them. Lillian Dellacourt is beautiful, refined and absolutely lethal. She’s also the most feared and merciless demon hunter in The Company. She’s come a long way from the penniless seamstress’s daughter sold to the highest bidder, and it wasn’t by trusting a man, let alone an exiled Marquis with more on his mind than slaying the hellspawn . . . For Dorian Lambert, Marquis de Montalembert, being sent to keep track of Lillian is no mean task. He’s wanted the fiery vixen since he first heard of her five years ago. But wooing the lady while fighting the demon uprising is no easy feat, especially when the lady’s tongue is as sharp as the Japanese sai blades she favors for eviscerating the spawn of hell. These two will have to learn to trust each other fast, because the demon master is back, and he’s planning to turn Edinburgh into a living hell… Amazon    BN     Kobo     iBooks     Kensington Chapter 1 Gripping the chair arms to keep herself seated, Lillian fought an urge to leave and never set foot inside Castle Brendaligh again. It had been a demoralizing battle and they had lost, but they had lived. They had done all they could, but still the demon master had ascended into man’s world. “You failed and we are all likely to die because of it. I hold every person at this table responsible for the state of England. You have ruined us.” Lord Clayton’s voice grated on Lillian’s nerves. Accounts of the battle were clear. Nearly everyone in the room had risked their lives trying to disrupt the ascension, not to mention keep the earl’s daughter, Belinda, from becoming a demon sacrifice. Making such a show of ferocious reprimands insulted their brave and selfless efforts. If not for the fact that he was her best friend’s father, she might have indulged her desire to pull a sai blade from her boot and slice his throat. As if Lord Clayton, the Earl of Shafton, needed to attract more attention, he waved his hands. “You had one mission, to keep the master from entering our world. All you had to do was kill one demon, but you failed. You should all be shot for treason. Treason!” His bright red face gave her hope his heart might fail and save her the trouble of killing him.  Other hunters at the table murmured, but no one spoke out. Everyone in this room is to blame. You had the perfect opportunity to end this mess. Now the master is free of his realm and living in ours. It’s only a matter of time before he is strong enough to destroy everything we hold dear. When your families are killed mercilessly, will you sit here so unrepentant about failing in your duty?” “Father, really.” Belinda Thurston rolled her eyes. Lillian missed Reece’s steadying presence. Reece might have even been able to stop his lordship’s tirade with a few quick-witted remarks. Her partner had nearly died, and now lay upstairs recovering from demon poisoning. “Don’t you roll your eyes at me, Belinda. You are equally to blame. You were with the master for days and made no attempt to destroy him.” Gabriel, Belinda’s husband, bristled. It was of course a ridiculous statement. The Earl of Tullering was not used to public abuse of his family. “Just a minute, my lord. You are out of order. Belinda was in no position to defeat the demon master. The information she gathered will be very helpful in our eventual victory.” Shafton pointed a fat finger. “I do not want to hear about information that will take years to decipher. You, Tullering, are by far the most culpable. You and that woman”—he pointed at Lillian—“made a conscious choice not to destroy the master.” Lillian reached toward her boot and let the hard steel of her sai blade handle bring her comfort. One second and Shafton’s head could be rolling down the long table and land in Drake Cullum’s lap. Besides Shafton, Drake and his assistant, Dorian Lambert, were the only ones present who had not been at the battle. Their leader, Drake, had attended to assign new orders to the hunters. Shafton said, “You could have destroyed the beast as it rose and was weakened. I know you had the opportunity, but you chose to save yourself. It was selfish and stupid.” Lillian could kill him and no one would be able to stop her. Of course, there were  always consequences when dealing with men in power. She’d lose her home within The Company. Yet another arrogant earl would not take her from her rightful place. She was in control. It was nothing like her youth and the titled man who’d ruined her life. Belinda said, “They saved my life, Father.” “It was the wrong choice, Belinda. You might have cost us our one chance to stop this.” Shafton narrowed his eyes on Lillian. Lillian said, “I can imagine your pleasure if we had allowed your only child to become the master’s sacrifice. Perhaps we should have stood by and watched until the master, with his full power rose, from the depths of hell and destroyed us all. As it is, Reece Foxjohn is still recovering from battle and the rest of us might have been sucked into the demon’s realm. But by all means, my lord, go on and tell us how you know we willfully failed on our mission. I do not recall your life being in danger that day at Fatum Manor. You were safely tucked away in your castle while the rest of us faced death or worse.” “You are out of order, Dellacourt.” Shafton said her name as if it were a curse. Lillian wasn’t sure when she had stood up, but clutching the leather wrapped steel, she rounded the table toward the earl. “If you have something you want to say about my abilities, my lord, I suggest you do so. I will be happy to display them for you, and we can evaluate them together.” “Miss Dellacourt.” A warning came from the other end of the table. “You were not there. You cannot know if we could have destroyed the master. As far as I’m concerned, we made the only choice possible under the circumstances. Maybe if your intelligence had supplied us with the location of the gateway before the master had grown so powerful, we might have been able to seal him in.” “How dare you imply that I failed in some way? You who completely disregard orders  at will.”  She had only ever hated one man the way she despised Shafton, and he too was an earl. At least that one was dead. Steeling her nerves, she slid the sai blade through the pocket cut in her skirt. “You speak of orders that were selfish and almost succeeded in getting your own family killed.” “You have no right to question me or my motives.” To his credit, he faced her and stared her in the eye. “I have every right when you point your fat finger at me.” “Who do you think you are? I know where you come from Lillian Dellacourt. I know what you are.” Drake Cullum pounded the table. “Shafton, that will do.” The demon hunters’ leader stood rigid, narrow-eyed. He was formidable when he was calm, but enraging him was never a good idea. He was furious now. Had she gone too far? The idea she might have overstepped her bounds with Cullum was enough to make her relax the grip on her blade. Lillian turned and stormed from the dining room. Shafton yelled something about not having dismissed her from the meeting. Once in the hallway, she pulled her second blade and turned to go back in and finish what she’d started. It would be nothing to remove his pompous head from his shoulders. Cullum stood in the doorway. He smiled at her and closed the door, baring her reentry. Had she ever seen him smile before? No instance came to mind. She stomped toward the front entrance. She’d leave the damn castle, get her carriage, and ride like the devil back to London. Yet the one person in the world she could really talk to was a resident of Brendaligh. Holding her full skirts with both hands, she sprinted up the curved grand staircase.   About the Author A.S.

Ahmed Mohamed, 14, told the newspaper he was arrested and accused of making a hoax bomb. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the student is Muslim and the case serves as an example of religious bigotry. 
 
“My hobby is to invent stuff,” Mohamed, a student at MacArthur High School in the suburb of Irving, told the paper in a video it posted online. He showed the clock that had a digital display and a circuit board. 
 
The new ninth-grader said he enjoys robotics and was looking to continue his interests as he started high school, so he showed the clock to a teacher. 
 
Irving Independent School District officials were not immediately available for comment. 
 
“They took me to a room filled with five officers,” Mohamed said. “They interrogated me, and searched through my stuff and took my tablet and my invention.” 
 
He was handcuffed and taken to a detention center where he was fingerprinted and had mug shots taken, the paper said. He was freed when his parents came for him, and is not expected to face formal charges. 
 
Mohamed has been suspended from school for three days, the paper said. 
 
Police told the paper the student informed them the object was a clock, but a spokesman said it could be mistaken for something else.

This is the 2015 Volkswagen Polo Bluemotion and it’s claimed to be super economical, without breaking the bank in terms of initial outlay – an affliction which handicaps most green vehicles of today. 

On the outside it resembles a normal Volkswagen Polo, but upon closer inspection you can see the small details which allow the Polo Bluemotion to slip through the air a little easier. There’s a bumper which features a small grille as well as cleverly-designed alloy wheels which offer less resistance. The tyres are specialised low rolling resistance units, which further saves fuel. 

All-New Eco Engine and Drive 

Powering the Polo Bluemotion is an all-new engine. The previous generation was powered by a diesel engine which offered commendable performance despite the small capacity. The only let down was turbo lag, which required owners to alter their driving style. Once adapted and driving in the correct manner, impressive fuel consumption figures were fairly easy to achieve. 

The latest version which you see here is powered by a 1-litre three-cylinder motor. Pushing out just 70kW and 160Nm, this little three-pot offers performance that most would laugh at seeing as it’s a car costing over R200 000. However out and out performance is not this little car’s forte. If you’re never in a hurry, the Polo Bluemotion offers a relaxed driving experience and if you get the driving style right, great returns on the trip computer can be had. 

Speaking of economy, the Polo Bluemotion claims 4.2L/100km which isn’t too unrealistic. Given the car’s 45 litre tank, a range of over 1000km is theoretically possible. During its week-long tenure with us and after a combination of both rural and urban driving, we saw figures sitting around the 5L/100km mark – which isn’t too bad. 

The vehicle has a five-speed manual gearbox which offers a pleasant action – good thing as you’ll be using the gears often to get the most out of the engine. See, if you’re Joe Average and you drive like an average South African road user, you’ll be constantly gearing down to get a move on. This is not how this car works and as mentioned earlier, it’s at its best if you drive gently and sedately. 

Interior and Features 

Standard specification in the Polo Bluemotion is reasonable, but in true Volkswagen fashion numerous options are available and our test unit highlighted things such as park distance control (R3 050), light & vision package (R3 700), composition media (R2 550) and bi-xenon headlights (R8 650). This brought the price up to R248 150 for the exact vehicle you see here. 

The vehicle comes with a substantial infotainment system which has all the niceties like radio/Bluetooth/USB functionality, but in the Polo Bluemotion you get a set of menus devoted to efficient driving. There’s even a section which offers easy-to-understand tips on how to get the most out of your car. These tips are great and educational, but it’s a rude awakening to see how you should really be driving 

! 

Despite being a specialised eco car, the bottom line is you’re still buying a Volkswagen Polo – a car that has a reputation for build quality and being a popular hatchback. You still get adequate rear legroom and the boot offers a useful 280-952 litres of space. 

Conclusion and Summary

Melissa Manchester 
 
After the 3,000-fan concert, guests proceeded to the Irvine Bowl to enjoy a special performance of the Pageant, the second to last production of the summer season, hosted by Academy Award-winner Mira Sorvino. 
 
Sorvino spoke about her father, actor and director Paul Sorvino, a gifted sculptor with an international following. She also described her excitement to witness Laguna Beach’s most well-known summer rite. “Earlier tonight, I had a peek backstage at the army of volunteers in action – in the cast and working backstage. And I’ve got to say, as incredible as I’m sure tonight’s show will be, the spirit of enthusiasm and dedication behind the scenes is every bit as inspiring.” 
 
Sorvino also pulled the winning tickets for two raffle prizes. Svetlana Ivachtchenko of Encinitas came up the winner of a trip to Hawaii. Bill Tomasic of Chino drove off with a 2016 Mazda Miata. 
 
The evening’s conclusion proved equally unusual. Pageant patron Scott Mucky issued a marriage proposal via projector during announcements about 2016’s theme, “Partners.” Scott’s partner-to-be, Vivianne, who was in the audience that night, said yes. 
 
The gala event grossed approximately $270,000 for future arts programming and the Building Fund for improvements of the Festival of Arts and Pageant of the Masters facility.

455819,92c4ad4e-ee7c-4c7b-af08-fb417aaa9f57,"Energy Creditors Balk at Deals Aimed at Saving Miners, Drillers",Bloomberg,"Creditors of drillers and miners are getting fed up with depressed commodities prices and are clamping down on bond deals that would help heavily indebted companies to ride out the slump. 

The arrangements, called debt exchanges, are designed to help borrowers cut their obligations and buy time by swapping old securities for fresh ones with longer maturities. In most cases, lenders accept upfront losses based on the expectations that they’ll eventually recuperate their investments, and more, when the companies start to grow again. 

As oil prices collapsed last month, investors became skeptical that there would be much upside from agreeing to deals that would help the companies manage their heavy debt loads. As a result, borrowers such as Arch Coal Inc. and Energy XXI Ltd. haven’t been able to get their debt exchanges done and instead are locked in stalemates with creditors. Samson Resources Corp., which failed to agree to a deal with its unsecured bondholders on a plan that would have kept the gas producer out of bankruptcy, said two weeks ago it will now pursue an in-court restructuring by Sept. 16. 
 
“It has become a much more challenging environment for out-of-court restructuring,” said David J. Karp, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP who specializes in distressed investing. “Creditors now believe that lower oil-and-gas pricing is here for the long haul.” 

Karp believes that the oil rout and buyers’ reluctance will result in more energy companies seeking bankruptcy protection over the next several months. 

Logan Bonacorsi, a spokeswoman for Arch Coal, didn’t respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Greg Smith, a spokesman at Energy XXI, declined to comment. 

Earlier in the year, as crude climbed to over $60 a barrel, a number of energy companies successfully negotiated distressed debt exchanges. Six deals closed in the second quarter, affecting a total of more than $10 billion in debt, compared to none a year earlier, according to a July report by Moody’s Investors Service. In the second quarter, oil-and-gas producers including Warren Resources Inc. and Midstates Petroleum Co. successfully completed debt exchange deals that helped reduce their obligations. 

Even then, creditors demanded sweetened terms, such as more senior debt that would protect their value in a downturn, in order to get the deals done. 

The door for debt exchanges started to close in late June as oil tanked and creditors became convinced that energy prices aren’t likely to bounce back soon. In the past couple of weeks two borrowers, Halcon Resources Corp. and Goodrich Petroleum Corp., managed to close their deals, but the damage to Halcon’s other lenders due to the transaction outweighed the benefit to the driller’s overall debt structure. Shortly after the agreement was done the Houston-based explorer’s bonds lost more than a quarter of their value because the arrangement was thought to have weakened the standing of other unsecured lenders. 
 
Arch Coal hasn’t been so lucky. A proposed deal with bondholders to swap some of their securities into higher-ranking and longer-dated debt is stuck in limbo after another group of lenders moved to block it. The exchange would help St. Louis-based Arch cut its interest expense and avoid a potential breach in its credit agreement. 

But as coal prices continued to drop, efforts to reach a compromise faltered, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The lenders grew concerned that the exchange wouldn’t save the beleaguered miner and concluded that they might be better off if the company filed for bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. 

The company has extended its deadline on the bond-exchange offer multiple times since it was announced July 2. 

Energy XXI, for its part, started negotiating with its creditors in May for a similar debt swap. The Houston-based oil and natural gas producer has been looking to reduce its $4.6 billion debt load and delay the 2017 and 2018 maturities. In early July, the company appeared to be close to reaching an agreement. 

Then crude prices plunged and Energy XXI’s creditors became skittish, said people with knowledge of the talks. Now the company is struggling to keep the negotiations alive, the people said. 

“We’ve now moved into a new mentality,” Karp said. “Investors believe the low commodity prices will be prolonged. The option to ride out the hedges hoping for prices to come back is out for many companies.”",731,"to deals that would help the companies manage their heavy debt loads. As a result, borrowers such as Arch Coal Inc. and Energy XXI Ltd. haven’t been able to get their debt exchanges done and instead are locked in stalemates with creditors. Samson Resources Corp., which failed to agree to a deal with its unsecured bondholders on a plan that would have kept the gas producer out of bankruptcy, said two weeks ago it will now pursue an in-court restructuring by Sept. 16. “It has become a much more challenging environment for out-of-court restructuring,” said David J. Karp, a partner at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP who specializes in distressed investing. “Creditors now believe that lower oil-and-gas pricing is here for the long haul.” Karp believes that the oil rout and buyers’ reluctance will result in more energy companies seeking bankruptcy protection over the next several months. Logan Bonacorsi, a spokeswoman for Arch Coal, didn’t respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment. Greg Smith, a spokesman at Energy XXI, declined to comment. Earlier in the year, as crude climbed to over $60 a barrel, a number of energy companies successfully negotiated distressed debt exchanges. Six deals closed in the second quarter, affecting a total of more than $10 billion in debt, compared to none a year earlier, according to a July report by Moody’s Investors Service. In the second quarter, oil-and-gas producers including Warren Resources Inc. and Midstates Petroleum Co. successfully completed debt exchange deals that helped reduce their obligations. Even then, creditors demanded sweetened terms, such as more senior debt that would protect their value in a downturn, in order to get the deals done. The door for debt exchanges started to close in late June as oil tanked and creditors became convinced that energy prices aren’t likely to bounce back soon. In the past couple of weeks two borrowers, Halcon Resources Corp. and Goodrich Petroleum Corp., managed to close their deals, but the damage to Halcon’s other lenders due to the transaction outweighed the benefit to the driller’s overall debt structure. Shortly after the agreement was done the Houston-based explorer’s bonds lost more than a quarter of their value because the arrangement was thought to have weakened the standing of other unsecured lenders. Arch Coal hasn’t been so lucky. A proposed deal with bondholders to swap some of their securities into higher-ranking and longer-dated debt is stuck in limbo after another group of lenders moved to block it. The exchange would help St. Louis-based Arch cut its interest expense and avoid a potential breach in its credit agreement. But as coal prices continued to drop, efforts to reach a compromise faltered, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The lenders grew concerned that the exchange wouldn’t save the beleaguered miner and concluded that they might be better off if the company filed for bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The company has extended its deadline on the bond-exchange offer multiple times since it was announced July 2. Energy XXI, for its part, started negotiating with its creditors in May for a similar debt swap. The Houston-based oil and natural gas producer has been looking to reduce its $4.6 billion debt load and delay the 2017 and 2018 maturities. In early July, the company appeared to be close to reaching an agreement. Then crude prices plunged and Energy XXI’s creditors became skittish, said people with knowledge of the talks. Now the company is struggling to keep the negotiations alive, the people said. “We’ve now moved into a new mentality,” Karp said. “Investors believe the low commodity prices will be prolonged. The option to ride out the hedges hoping for prices to come back is out for many companies.”","Creditors of drillers and miners are getting fed up with depressed commodities prices and are clamping down on bond deals that would help heavily indebted companies to ride out the slump. The arrangements, called debt exchanges, are designed to help borrowers cut their obligations and buy time by swapping old securities for fresh ones with longer maturities.

The National Retail Federation released its 2015 Halloween Consumer Top Costumes survey, and a Yahoo News report indicated princess costumes topped the kid category for the 11th year in a row, with Batman and other action heroes coming in at second and third, respectively. According to Yahoo News, the survey featured responses from 6,754 consumers. Princesses topping the list means an estimated 3.2 million children will pick that costume to wear Oct. 31; in comparison, 2 million children will dress as Anna or Elsa from Disney's ""Frozen,"" which NRF listed as the fifth most popular. Above all, Kathy Grannis Allen, senior director of media relations at the NRF, attributed princess costumes' long run at the top to an interest in fairy tales. “Children love the idea of fairy tales, which they learn about at a very young age,” Allen told Yahoo News. “This could contribute to princess costumes topping the list for so many years.” But pop culture dictates their choices too. In addition to ""Frozen"" and Batman, Star Wars characters and Minions made the list, according to Consumer Affairs. This proves Halloween reflects landmark events in pop culture on a year-to-year basis, said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. “As we’ve seen for several years, Hollywood and pop culture both have a tremendous impact on how adults and their children decide to dress the part each Halloween, and it’s evident some of the biggest newsmakers of the year will be out in full force this fall,” Shay told Consumer Affairs.

367886,c49e8a29-61f6-42df-a02f-1df1b5fb686a,What’s with news media that censor news?,Japan Times,"NEW YORK – If a pizza shop refused to sell pizza, everyone would say it was run by crazy people. 
 
What does it say about the people who run the news media that they don’t want to report news? 
 
If you read on, you probably expect this lede to be revealed as hyperbole. Sorry, no. I mean it: newspaper editors and TV producers routinely come across delicious slices of news, and then decide not to publish it or put it on the air. 
 
Yet nobody calls them what they are: censors. 
 
Or crazy people. 
 
News businesses constantly refuse to serve news to eager news consumers. Because censorship is normative, it rarely makes the news itself. 
 
Last week’s debate over whether to run photos of the body of a 3-year-old boy on a beach, a Syrian refugee boy who drowned off the coast of Turkey, is a revealing exception. 
 
“As the photographs appeared again and again in timelines on Facebook and Twitter, spurred in part by their publication on the websites of major European newspapers, a debate broke out about the ethics of sharing such graphic images of a dead child,” Robert Mackey reported in The New York Times. 
 
“There were also disagreements inside newsrooms about whether to publish or even share the images. A number of reporters argued forcefully that it was necessary to confront the public with the human toll of the war in Syria, and the impact of policies that make it difficult for refugees to find asylum in Europe. But many editors were concerned about shocking their readers and wanted to avoid the appearance of trafficking in sensational images for profit.” 
 
Debate? There should be no debate. 
 
Newspapers sell news. When an editor decides whether an item ought to go into her newspaper, she ought to consider one question, and one question only: Is it news? 
 
If it’s news, it goes in. No matter what. 
 
Clearly, Europe’s refugee crisis is news. Tens of thousands of people, many fleeing civil wars and poverty in North Africa and the Middle East, are escaping to Europe on rickety vessels, some of which founder and sink in the Mediterranean. The European Union can’t come up with a plan to deal with them. It’s a story involving big issues like nativism, xenophobia, racism and a vacuum of political leadership, as well as blowback from American and European foreign interventionism. 
 
Though sentimental and perhaps a bit mawkish, the heartbreaking photo of the drowned boy illustrates the human cost of Europe’s failure vis-a-vis the refugee crisis. Which makes it news. 
 
So it should run. 
 
Easy decision, really. So why are editors worried about irrelevant concerns, like whether the photo is “tasteful”? 
 
For some editors, according to the Times, it came down to whether readers could see the boy’s face: 
 
“Many news organizations in the United States decided to publish pictures of the dead child in their print or online editions, but they were divided over whether to show more graphic images of the boy lying in the sand with his face partially visible. The New York Times published a less jarring image that shows a Turkish police officer carrying the child away but conceals his face. Several other newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal and The Baltimore Sun, followed the same course of action.” 
 
Thank you, Editor Nanny, but I’ll take my news the way God intended it: 200 proof, undiluted. 
 
This is yet another case of a tiny good — respect for the dead — causing a big harm. 
 
Hundreds of people, including that Syrian boy, are dying, and dying horribly. Their deaths are totally avoidable. The European Union, home to hundreds of millions of people, can easily absorb even a million refugees. The U.S., whose foreign wars are in large part responsible for the crisis, can help subsidize resettlement costs, and invite many of the victims to come here. 
 
Posting the more “jarring” image (which appeared all over the Internet anyway) might help jar the world into taking action. Conversely, not posting it delays action, guaranteeing that more little boys will die. 
 
Surely saving those boys is more important than worrying making readers queasy over their morning cereal — yes, even if some of those readers are kids themselves. 
 
“I understand the argument for running the photo as a way to raise awareness and call attention to the severity of the refugee crisis, and I don’t begrudge outlets that did,” Vox media editorial director Max Fisher, “but I ultimately I decided against running it because the child in that photo can’t consent to becoming a symbol.” Does this mean Vox won’t run any images of dead people, ever? Or images of people who don’t consent to being photographed? That’ll make Vox even more boring. 
 
You know what’s worse than taking a chance that kids will see pictures of dead kids? Not taking that chance, so that more kids wind up dead.

This is wrong. It's even sad that 11 out of 14 journalists saw pizzerias as part of their daily diet and denied the concept of ""normalizing"" news largely because the whole damn thing doesn't happen that way. News chains aren't bad, but they're shitting on them. And by the way, 60%"," customers because their sources didn't always make sense — at least when one source claimed she saw how hard some pies were being cooked with her own hands in order for those cookies (and others) delivered from another restaurant just off-campus … well... never mind if all your friends also have pie doughs lying around somewhere!

When we asked whether more reports might soon go viral like these ones show, Annenberg explained many said yes; only very few cited any recent scandals involving food chains where questionable business practices surfaced before October 17… especially since there is now quite reasonable reason why so high percentages do appear elsewhere [see our previous post].

You Do You"" combines literary and visual art",The Boyertown Area Times,"Writers and artists are invited to submit work to Studio B’s third annual exhibit combining literary and visual art entitled “To Be: Know Thyself... You Do You.” 
  
“The theme for this year’s exhibit is intended to celebrate the 500th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death, presumed to be April 23, 1616,” said Jane Stahl, Studio B’s director of Community Relations and former teacher of English. 
  
“Shakespeare, considered the gold medal winner of writers, of all time, told stories of people’s lives, their joys and struggles, their hopes and dreams, their successes and failures,” said Stahl. “And through those stories, he offered perspectives about life itself. We want our writers and artists to tell their life’s story.” 
  
Stahl explained, “Writers are encouraged to write something that responds or connects to something Shakespeare wrote or illustrates who you are, what you believe about life, death, or anything else of import. Write a sonnet, a soliloquy, a monologue, a dialogue, a story, a one-act play or an essay, narrative or persuasive. Blank verse. Free verse. Limerick or haiku. Just tell us what Shakespeare inspired in you, who you are in some way, what’s important to you or how you see life itself.” 
 
 
  
Submission Details 

Writers should submit work as a Doc or DocX file or type submissions inside an email along with a brief (about five-sentence) biography by Nov. 1. The submissions will be included in Studio B’s third book of poetry and prose. There is no fee for submission. Copies of the book will be available for purchase at the exhibit’s opening reception.

“For artists, the challenge is to create something that connects to something Shakespeare wrote or helps us see who are, what is important to you or what life’s about from your view,” said Stahl. “Will you offer portraits, realistic or metaphoric, of yourself, your neighborhood, friends, family, things or places of your dreams or nightmares?

Context for the Theme 

“I was challenged by a recent Facebook post to tell my life’s story in six words,” said Stahl. “I offered, ‘I want everybody to be happy,’ and then I laughed realizing what a fool’s errand my life story has been. I’ve spent inordinate energy, time and money for over 60 years trying to arrange my life and the lives of others so that everybody’s happy. Guess what? No one is, at least not for long. My experiences could fill volumes,” Stahl added. 
  
Continuing, Stahl explained, “A few years ago my late cousin John challenged me to create a sentence in five words or less expressing what I’d want folks to say about me once I am no longer alive. ‘She showed up’ is how I hope I’m remembered; and, again, I have experiences to share of times where just ‘being there’ mattered to someone.”

Kevin Burnett suffered from a severe form of asthma, known as brittle asthma, and collapsed and died last Wednesday. 
 
The Darwen Aldridge Community Academy pupil, who had only just started high school, regularly suffered from severe asthma attacks and had been resuscitated in the past, but he had also suffered seizures in recent years. 
 
Mum Laura Partington, 33, of Maria Street, Darwen, said: “We had just got his PE kit that day. He was so excited. 
 
“He wanted to try it on and he asked if he could watch a film after. 
 
“He went upstairs to put his PE kit on but then started struggling to breathe. He went purple very quickly and his eyes rolled back. 
 
“We tried CPR and the paramedics came but they couldn’t do anything. It just happened so quickly.” 
 
She said Kevin had made an impact on the lives of everyone came into contact with. 
 
She said: “He was a real cheeky chappy. There wasn’t a person he met who wasn’t touched by his personality. 
 
“He was very confident and talkative. He never imposed his illness on anyone. He never wanted to be a burden to anyone.” 
   Promoted stories   
Kevin, whose middle name was Keegan, after the Manchester City manager at the time he was born, was one of six brothers. 
 
His younger brothers, Lewis, five, Jake, six, and Ben, 10, are still at St Barnabas, the Darwen primary school he attended, while older brothers John, 13, and Lucas, 14, are students at DACA. 
 
Laura said Kevin had a great sense of humour, and particularly liked to tell his favourite joke. 
 
She said: “He would always tell people the same joke, the hospital staff, teachers, anyone he met. 
 
“It was ‘what do you call a man floating in the sea with no arms and no legs? Bob’. He loved telling people that joke.” 
 
Having been born with asthma, Kevin developed brittle asthma when he was six and then started suffering from seizures, the cause of which was undiagnosed, in 2013. 
 
Of the brittle asthma Laura said: “It’s very uncontrollable. You can get severe asthma attacks. He would be using his inhaler every four hours with six to 10 puffs and was on constant antibiotics and steroids to try and control it. 
 
“He would spend a lot of time in the children’s ward at Royal Blackburn Hospital . He knew all the staff on first name terms. The nurses and doctors were always fantastic. I can’t thank them enough. 
 
“He would be in hospital about once a month, although he hadn’t been in for a while so we were starting to think things were improving.” 
 
Before leaving St Barnabas, Kevin played the role of Demetrius in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Nights Dream. 
 
He was also a big music and sport fan, going to watch FC United with step-dad Steven Kenyon, 33. 
 
The family have been inundated with flowers, cards and messages of support. 
 
Laura said: “Nothing will ever take the pain away or relieve the pain, but the messages of comfort do help. It’s nice to know he was loved by so many and people thought so much of him.” 
 
St Barnabas and DACA have both offered support and have laid on counselling for his brothers and anyone else affected by Kevin’s death. 
 
Helen Thomas, headteacher at St Barnabas, said: “Kevin was a ray of light in school. His courage and his determination was an inspiration to all of us. 
 
“He was always smiling when he came into school. He was witty, funny, always positive. He was just a little superstar.” 
 
Brendan Loughran, principal at DACA, said: “We had all got to know him very well in a relatively short period of time. 
 
“He had made a great impression in the summer school at the Academy and had made an excellent start to his secondary education. 
 
“Kevin was outgoing and had an engaging personality and left a positive and lasting impression on everyone.”

505426,bd4d9fd1-01f7-4a81-9244-17034d39de1d,"Germany, Denmark Advance in Battle to Save Covered Bond Label",Washington Post,"(Bloomberg) -- Bowing to pressure from Germany and Denmark, the European Commission said any steps to create a single covered bond market would entail shielding the label against copycat assets that might threaten the $2.6 trillion industry. 

Efforts to create a single framework for covered bonds -- a “cornerstone of long-term finance” -- would seek to “avoid contagion from lower quality instruments in a crisis,” the commission, the European Union’s executive arm, said in a Sept. 30 consultation paper. The use of the term would be limited to instruments that fulfill criteria set by regulators, it said. 

Denmark and Germany, the world’s largest covered bond markets, have warned against sacrificing the strict regulations that govern their industries to create a single, liquid European market. Easing requirements would risk undermining investor confidence in the secured debt market, which emerged unscathed from the financial crisis. Banks holding the bonds get favorable capital treatment. 

The commission’s message failed to erase skepticism about the single-market plan, not least because it left open the option of using business loans as collateral. Most covered bonds are backed by mortgage or public sector loans. 

‘Good Reasons’ 

“We’ll of course go into this with an open mind and emphasize the good features of the Danish system, but we are a bit skeptical about harmonizing the covered bond systems,” said Karsten Beltoft, head of the Danish Mortgage Bankers’ Federation. “There are good reasons for having different systems in different countries, and I am sure that many countries believe they have the best system. We do.” 

Bond systems are shaped by a variety of factors that addressing only financing can’t resolve, such as taxation and foreclosure procedures, Beltoft said. “As long as those aren’t the same in all countries, I think it will be difficult,” he said. 

EU financial-services chief Jonathan Hill has emphasized the need to increase the funding options of small and medium- sized companies. Their reliance on banks left them particularly exposed as lenders shrank balance sheets in the financial crisis. 

In its consultation paper, the commission queried whether it’s possible to identify “prime” loans to small and medium- sized businesses that could be used as assets in cover pools, even as it sought to appease industry concerns about diluting the brand. 

Rising Issuance 

Global covered bond issuance climbed 50 percent in the 10 years through 2014, to 2.5 trillion euros ($2.8 trillion), according to the European Covered Bound Council. The industry group has sought to prevent securities backed by business loans being labeled as covered bonds and instead suggests introducing a new product category. 

“It’s important to keep a clear distinction between traditional covered bonds and potential dual-recourse solutions for SMEs,” said Luca Bertalot, secretary general of the ECBC. 

Legislation governing which institutions may issue covered bonds vary widely from country to country. The same applies to setting requirements for covered pools, insolvencies and disclosure. 

Those differences make it difficult to create a market that stretches across Europe, according to the commission. Pricing differences already exist between countries, it said. 

Under its proposal, European regulators would certify covered bonds, which would be designated as “regulated,” and a third-party would monitor collateral quality. The ratio of loans to the asset values would also be monitored regularly, and a common over-collateralization requirement would be set. 

Such measures “could unlock a number of potential benefits for participants in covered bond markets and for the general economy” and could be taken either voluntarily or through EU legislation, the commission said. 

Denmark’s covered bond market would prefer to see a voluntary system that excludes business loans from collateral pools, particularly since the benefits are “questionable,” Beltoft said.",606,"the world’s largest covered bond markets, have warned against sacrificing the strict regulations that govern their industries to create a single, liquid European market.

The government opened the financial bids to execute the three-year targeted free health insurance scheme for the poorest here on Wednesday. 
 
The government-owned State Life Insurance Corporation offered the lowest bid of Rs1,300 per family annually to extend priority and secondary health facilities in 23 districts of the country. 
 
The final bid price is almost 50% less than what the government had estimated in its PC-I document of the project. It calculated the secondary health coverage cost at Rs2,000 per family and Rs500 for tertiary health package. 
 
The State Life gave a Rs999.99 per family offer for secondary care and Rs299.99 for tertiary care, bringing its total bid to Rs1,300 per family. The State Life Insurance Corporation is under the administrative control of Ministry of Commerce. 
 
Jubilee General Insurance gave the second lowest bid of Rs2,449 per family followed by the consortium of Adamjee Insurance and Alfalah Bank that gave Rs3,067 bid. 
 
“The corporation made the offer on no-profit no-loss basis under its Corporate Social Responsibility,” said State Life Insurance Corporation General Manager Health Nadeem Bessey while talking to The Express Tribune . 
 
Some concerns raised 
 
While declaring the State Life Insurance Corporation as the winner, Minister of State for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination Saira Afzal Tarar was blunt in her assessment of the successful bidder. “Despite capacity constraints of the winner, the government does not have an option but to give the contract to State Life Insurance Corporation to meet the requirements of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.” 
 
She highlighted that State Life Insurance Corporation had failed to execute Waseela-e-Sehat scheme under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). 
 
The minister urged the winner to build capacity and ensure that the poorest get quality health services. 
 
However, Bessey refused to share full responsibility of the Waseela-e-Sehat programme, insisting that the problem lied with the enrollment of people and this task had been performed by other agencies. 
 
“The successful execution of the programme is largely dependent upon the insurance company’s ability to deliver,” said Privatisation Commission Chairman Mohammad Zubair. 
 
Zubair co-chairs the National Steering Committee of the Health Insurance programme along with the Health Minister. 
 
The National Steering Committee will meet today (Thursday) to formally approve State Life Insurance Corporation as the successful bidder. 
 
In the first phase, each provincial government has picked four districts, which will be covered under the scheme. Two districts each from Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Gilgit Baltistan, two agencies of Fata and the federal capital will be covered under the programme. 
 
The insurance company will identify roughly 10 million individuals earning less than Rs200 a day in 23 districts by using BISP data. The identified families will be entitled to avail up to Rs50,000 per year in secondary health care facilities. A beneficiary family will also be entitled to get up to Rs250,000 against seven serious diseases like heart attack, diabetes, burn injuries, kidney treatment excluding its transplantation and cancer under the tertiary care package. 
 
The federal government will bear the cost of tertiary care while the provincial governments will finance the secondary care treatment. 
 
The government had initially envisaged to cover 100 million poor people, which would have cost Rs45 billion. However, due to financial constraints, the scope of the scheme was reduced to only 23 districts, covering 10 million.

Clive Mason/Getty 

With the Premier League season starting to take shape there are several intriguing matches in store this weekend. 

Under pressure managers Dick Advocaat of Sunderland and Newcastle's Steve McClaren both face tough tasks. The Black Cats must travel to Old Trafford and the Magpies welcome Chelsea to St James' Park. 

Brendan Rodgers is also drinking in the last chance saloon and knows that his faltering Liverpool side, with only four goals so far this season, cannot afford to slip up against Aston Villa at Anfield. 

Arsenal's visit to Leicester sees fourth take on fifth in the league, although few would have thought it would be the Foxes riding high in fourth. Defeat against Claudio Ranieri's men could have ramifications for Arsene Wenger. 

Third placed West Ham will be hoping to carry on where they left off against Man City as they welcome Norwich to the Boleyn Ground. 

But the game of the week sees league leaders Manchester City travel to the recently vandalised White Hart Lane on Saturday. 

City looked unstoppable for the first few weeks of the season but defeat to Juventus in the Champions League was swiftly followed by another loss against the Hammers, and they are now only two points clear of Man United at the top of the table. 

Spurs lost to Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday but that setback was only their second loss of the season, and Mauricio Pochettino's men have been improving in recent weeks after a slow start to the campaign. 

Key to the clash could be the form of the two main strikers. Neither Sergio Aguero nor Harry Kane have been firing this season, indeed Kane has yet to score for his club this season, prompting fears that he could prove to be a one season wonder. However, the England man has two in two games for his country and has not stopped hunting. 

Aguero, who is fit again after a knock against Crystal Palace, has only two goals this campaign, but he boasts a fearsome record against Tottenham. The Argentine has ten goals in seven league matches against Spurs, while Manchester City have scored 27 goals in their last eight Premier League games against Tottenham. 

Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris will not be looking forward to the game. 

However, with defenders Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld, who missed the Arsenal match, back in the line-up the Londoners will be hopeful of stifling the visitors. Up front Son Heung-min has had an instant impact and has taken some of the heat of the misfiring Kane, who seems certain to find the net soon. 

A draw might be the most likely outcome, but it is unlikely to be of the 0-0 variety and with Christian Eriksen back in the side, Kane could break his duck, although Son is a better bet at 15-2 to open the scoring.",497,"against Aston Villa at Anfield.

In all seriousness though it would be hard leftishers like John McGuwaine - currently second best amongst full timers but being relegated after two title achievements when he made 20 league appearances across five seasons under Pep Guardiola -- should hold off their manager by doing just what Mourinho did 10 weeks ago here (making 1st half saves).

BOSTON -- Clippers coach Doc Rivers said during a return trip to Boston on Wednesday that he called Brad Stevens almost immediately after the Celtics hired him and asked him to take over his role with the local ABCD charity. Rivers still makes the annual summer trip back for a night of hoops -- and to enjoy Boston in its late-summer glory.
""Oh, it’s awesome. Every year we do this: I come back a couple days early and get my golf in, go to my restaurants and just kinda hang out,” said Rivers. ""The charity thing is nice. It’s just a good group and you wanna just keep doing it. I’m so happy with Brad. Like, one of the first things when I decided to leave and the Celtics hired him, I called him and said, 'Hey, I need a favor.' He was like, ‘What?” I said, 'I need you to take over this for me' and he’s done that. He’s been great.”
Rivers is also a fan of Stevens’ work in getting Boston back to the playoffs in only two seasons.
""I can’t imagine coming to this franchise and never coaching in the NBA -- that’s not the easiest gig,” said Rivers. ""He’s done it very well. He’s a terrific coach. He runs terrific stuff. And I thought this year, after all the trades, you could see he had a group of guys that believed in him and you can see the difference in their play.

Sandberg, author of Lean In: Women, Work And The Will To Lead, has spearheaded 24,000 circles in 120 countries in a bid to counteract gender bias in the workplace.  

On Monday afternoon, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter met with Sandberg and 15 women from all ranks and military services to discuss supporting existing groups in the government and creating more  - that will even operate during working hours. 

'If you look at the numbers, it's clear that we are not where we should be in terms of the leadership reflecting the overall force,' a senior defense official. 'It's important that our force reflect the nation that it protects.'

In recent years, the Pentagon has stepped up its recruitment of women and minorities, and is moving to open more - if not all - combat jobs to women, a continuing source of debate among military and civilian leaders 

Lean In circles initially focused on helping empower women to tackle ongoing challenges in the workplace, but the organization this year encouraged men to get engaged as well. 

In recent years, the Pentagon has stepped up its recruitment of women and minorities, and is moving to open more - if not all - combat jobs to women, a continuing source of debate among military and civilian leaders. Decisions are due this fall. 

Women make up about 15 percent of the U.S. military, and thousands of women have served alongside men in Iraq and Afghanistan. But women also leave military service during the mid-career phase at twice the rate of men, and top military officials are seeking ways to retain them. 

The Lean In foundation provides free material on its website for topics ranging from practical ways to counteract gender bias to principles of leadership. 

Carter's public support of Lean In is part of his larger 'Force of the Future' initiative aimed at bringing military workplace practices more in synch with changes in the civilian world, said the official. 

'This has been a proven model for inspiring collaboration and helping people reach their professional goals, and he hopes that can be duplicated and broadened throughout the Department of Defense,' the official said.

The defense official said some mixed gender groups were already meeting at the U.S. Naval Academy, where Sandberg has spoken and led Lean In circles several times. Sandberg has also worked closely with the U.S. Marine Corps. 

U.S. Navy Commander Emily Bassett, executive officer of the USS Arlington, an amphibious U.S. Navy transport ship, says her Lean In circle of three years gives her a 'lifeline of mentorship.' 

When the ship deploys to the Mediterranean in coming weeks, Bassett will be responsible for about 1,200 people from many diverse backgrounds, which can pose many daily challenges, she said. 

'Just knowing I could call anyone in my Lean In group ... is a huge comfort to me. I don't ever feel alone. I know I could pick up the phone and say, 'How would you deal with this situation?' or 'Have you ever experienced this?' she said. 

Bassett said she welcomed Carter's initiative and hoped it would encourage others to set up their own Lean In circles. 

'What's important to me about Lean In, is that it's affecting the culture in the military to make it a safe, conducive place for women and men to talk about gender bias' and diversity, said Bassett, who has two children aged 4 and 6, and a stay-at-home husband.

ADVERTISEMENTA new poll released by Chegg Media Center on Tuesday finds Sanders the overwhelming favorite on college campuses, drawing 59 percent of the student vote.
Former first lady Hillary Clinton, considered the Democratic favorite going into the election, draws just 18 percent support from the coveted college bloc, while Vice President Biden — who is yet to commit to a presidential run — sits at 14 percent support among university students.
The poll also shows that Clinton and Biden are deadlocked at 29 percent for students’ second choice in the Democratic primary.
Sanders has the highest favorability rating among Democrats at 62 percent, while Clinton is seen as the most unfavorable, with 47 percent of students expressing disapproval of the former secretary of State.
The same poll conducted in late June, about a month after Sanders announced his White House bid, found that students preferred Clinton by a 40 to 26 percent margin.
However, the junior senator from Vermont has steadily increased his lead among university-goers.
In an early August iteration of the poll, Sanders took the lead from Clinton by a 40 to 31 percent margin, and in a poll later that month, he was up 48 to 20 percent, while Clinton has been dogged by an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State.
Only 6 percent of students identify as socialists, but that has not stopped them from supporting the avowed Democratic socialist.
Students also overwhelmingly say they prefer a “Newcomer/Outsider” candidate, as opposed to a “Washington Insider,” by a 53 to 24 percent margin, suggesting that Sanders, despite serving in Congress for 24 years, has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate.
Chegg surveyed 333 college students at two- and four-year universities nationwide from Sept. 7 to Sept. 11. The margin of error is 5 percent.

In terms for product design;

... In relation about clothing brand packaging products such that they're all ready made so people can go carry them around on board or at home with minimal effort when it comes an important task like carrying groceries etc.( 3 ). These categories form where we'll work out which category represents 'design', one item fits more comfortably inside its bag because you only have room if your backpack just keeps flying back from somewhere else - but don't worry! You always know what shape was needed first by going through customs office before even applying :) When deciding whether there's quality suitable piece within fitment pack,or use special application type plastic binder lining material instead.. There really isn?t much I could say regarding these two items since i decided not wearing my tshirt would look better elsewhere!!

620979,074672e9-a661-4c74-b782-908b2e0f092e,AngryAsian: Quit cutting corners,BikeRadar All the latest from BikeRadar.com,"Going downhill fast is fun. But if the only way you can manage to shred the descents is to literally cut corners, that doesn’t make you a monster on Strava or a winner by any stretch. It makes you a douchebag.
The rising popularity of enduro is the best thing to happen to mountain biking in ages. The bikes are incredibly capable and forgiving when pointed downhill yet still remarkably spry when it comes time to pedal. More importantly, there’s less emphasis on reducing weight and more focus on having fun, and rider skill levels everywhere are increasing exponentially. Naturally, better bikes lead to faster riding and there’s no shortage of YouTube videos to show off the talents of the properly skilled. As has always been the case with big leaps in bike technology, though, such baked-in proficiency can also make up for a lack of skill if you’re feeling lazy. Whereas once you descended like a bag of anvils, now you can descend like a bag of anvils cozily strapped down in the bed of a monster truck and just hang on.The easy way, and the best way
There are lots of ways to get down a mountain quickly, particularly when there are lots of twists and turns to contend with. The best way – and arguably, the most impressive – is to figure out how to navigate the trail with a combination of speed and finesse without straying off the beaten path. The easy way is to ignore the various twists and turns that lay before you and just straight-line everything.
Much as I love the effect that enduro has had on bikes, it unfortunately also seems to be inadvertently cultivating poor behavior on the trail. Unlike traditional downhill or cross-country events, enduro courses are almost impossible to complete tape off; they just cover too much ground in too short a time to make comprehensive marking practical. As a result, some riders are taking increasingly liberal line choices to save time and with placings, prizes and sometimes money on the line, it’s all too easy to follow in someone else’s footsteps. Left behind afterward is plenty of trail damage and the bruised spirits of riders who maybe didn’t do as well on paper but mostly stuck to the straight-and-narrow. Rider etiquette has always varied on and off the racecourse but sadly, this behavior is now spilling over on to public trails. Sorry to pick on you again, guys, but Strava has basically turned every ride into a race, and too many riders are forgetting that public trails aren’t meant to be rallied like that. Corners that had been tight singletrack for years suddenly have meters-wide entries as riders try to carry more and more speed. Sweeping series of switchbacks have B-lines hurtling straight down the fall line. Rock sections that were once considered requisite challenges now have burned-in paths that avoid them altogether.Skirting the rules
I’ve certainly noticed a lot more of these cheater lines on trails here in Colorado recently but it’s hardly a local phenomenon. “I don't even know where to start when it comes to cutting corners but bottom line, I think it's super lame, especially for the non-racer types,” said a friend who lives and rides in the Bay Area of California. “Why would you even think about cutting corners while out on a bike ride? If you want to be faster, work on your skills and carry more speed through those corners.”
“Enduro racers are the biggest culprits, especially the ones who deliberately go looking for gaps in the organizers taping job and find ways to completely straightline corners,” he continued. “I've experience this firsthand after an enduro race was held on a few of my local trails where I've been riding for years. The next weekend I returned to find a plethora of new shortcut lines. I know many say that it's the organizer’s responsibility to completely tape the course if they don't want racers cutting corners but I don't need tape to show me where the trail is. Race organizers put tape to guide racers in the right direction and it should be obvious that they intended them to follow the defined trail.” So yes, you might think to yourself, ‘hey, I’m still within the course tape’, or ‘it’s not like I stuck a needle in my arm’. You might not technically be cheating but blatant disregard for a prescribed trail is just another form of skirting the rules in my book. Go ahead and be as proud as you want of that killer time but if you avoided parts of the trail in doing so, should it even count?
Shaving a few seconds simply isn’t worth making those kinds of compromises, particularly on public trails. Whatever happened to riding with integrity? I don’t care where the course tape is – or if there isn’t any at all. We all know where the trail is, and we all have a responsibility to actually ride on it.
I already deal with plenty of fellow cyclists out on the road who do the rest of us a disservice by ignoring traffic laws and generally riding like entitled asshats. If you don’t mind, then, I’d rather not see that sort of idiocy out on the trail, too.",883,"better bikes lead to faster riding and there’s no shortage of YouTube videos to show off the talents of the properly skilled.

Enter Pugsley High School, where mountain biking scared me that I would crash outside my bike, on a narrow, fairly impassible pathway. Nowadays, that's hard enough because me-too's hard not to be. But despite what the world calls a kludge when it comes"," this means we need all these cyclists as long-haul commuters! When I first began riding an Enduvergo one year ago (the bike was nearly 20 pounds lighter than expected before), my wife got off her ultralight seat for about half hour each day while taking me at least 15 minutes from town every morning—and after doing 25 miles back home without noticing much differently due to distance limits like winter —I found myself stopping some times early during mid October just so folks could get their fix outta here somewhere safe enough until they were ableto return late into November instead.""
The final point: no matter how many riders who have become familiar with Street Fighter V may conclude ""they're too busy getting high"", most consider themselves unqualified climbers today because not being comfortable climbing mountains does nothing but cause other people little pain….even though Climbing Mountains has taught them what true courage consists within itself; where life's hard knocks upon its enemies take root…on those hills your legs shake"

It has been more than a month since the #AAnakAnakMalaysia campaign started and today marks the final day of the simple yet meaningful campaign.
What started out as a campaign to unite Malaysians and uphold the spirit of independence quickly grew and flooded social media, especially with images of the people creatively expressing their patriotism using the campaign’s signature #AnakAnakMalaysia wristband.
Together, two proud Malaysian companies – EcoWorld Develop­ment Group Bhd and Star Media Group Bhd (formerly Star Publications (M) Bhd) – banded together to remind us what it means to be Malaysian and to look beyond skin, cultural background, race and creed.
The campaign stands firm in its belief that embracing diversity is key to success and with millions of shares of pictures with the hashtag (at www.anakanakmalaysia.com), it was evident that the campaign struck a chord in the hearts of Malaysians.
Wong (left) beaming with pride as he shows his solidarity with Malaysians. The Star sat down with EcoWorld chairman Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin, executive director Liew Tian Xiong and Star Media Group Bhd group managing director and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai to hear from them the journey of the campaign towards Malaysia Day and its impact.
Tian Xiong said the response to the #AnakAnakMalaysia campaign was beyond what was imagined.
When coming up with a Merdeka-Malaysia Day campaign, he said the group branding team had wanted to do something different.
“Over the years, we realised that fewer flags are being waved. We just wanted to do something significant and remind people that there is a lot to look forward to in this country,” he said.
Although there were about 20,000 pictures shared through the hashtag, Tian Xiong said the total number of shares accumulated to about six million across all social media platforms.
“Everyone was posting pictures –no matter where they were. There were so many creative pictures,” he said.
Tian Xiong’s favourite so far has been the one where a father uses his fingers to form the shape of a heart on his pregnant wife’s belly, signifying the coming of an “Anak Malaysia”.
The campaign drew attention in the media with Tian Xiong even getting personal feedback.
“Everyone has been saying that it’s a good campaign. We made 480,000 wristbands for this and there are still people asking for more,” he said, adding that he always made it a point to pass these to his friends whenever they met up for their weekly football games.
“I’ve never been embarrassed to be a Malaysian. This country has a lot to offer and it gives you character.
“Even when I was studying abroad, I always wanted to come back,” he said.
Growing up, Tian Xiong said being tolerant of other races came naturally, particularly when he was surrounded by people of various ethnic groups every day.
His father Kee Sin said as a parent, the key was to teach children to respect each other, not to look at skin colour, and to embrace diversity.
“Parents should let their children mix and mingle with different races and Malaysians should make friends, rekindle friendships and not stay within their own boundaries,” he said.
In EcoWorld, he said diversity was their theme, which was embraced by all employees.
Growing up in Plentong New Village, he said it never mattered what race each child in the football field was then as everyone just bonded over the sport.
He believes that the reason for such troubled times in the country is because people have taken the country’s richness in culture, race, and religions for granted.
Leaders, he said, should now think of ways to move forward.
A proud Malaysian, he said he always did his little part in placing Malaysia on the world map whenever he travelled.
“I always make it clear to everyone I meet where I come from and will continue to remind people,” he said, adding that overseas, it did not matter what one’s race was as everyone identified themselves as Malaysians.
Wong agreed with EcoWorld that the response to the campaign had been overwhelmingly successful.
“The National Day-Malaysia Day campaign struck a chord with all layers of Malaysians because the majority of us are tired of race politicians and, certainly, disconnected politicians who use race and religion to ensure their survival.
“This is not what most moderate Malaysians want for this country. Malaysians want to celebrate these two great days, not mark these important dates with fear.
“We must be able to go to the streets on Aug 31 and Sept 16 in a celebration of joy. These two dates are about Malaysians of all races, religions and cultures coming together as one people,” he said.
It was shocking, he added, that some had chosen to draw and emphasise on the differences – whether real or imaginary.
Wong said they got daily calls from Malaysians wanting to be part of the initiative and, regardless of race, he could see the genuine joy and pride each time they put on the wristbands.
“We share this joy for our little part in making history for Malaysia.
“It was truly a people’s initiative to spread the word of moderation and we hope to carry out a similar collaboration next year where, again, all Malaysians can make a simple statement of their love for our Malaysia which we truly love,” he said.

'There are a lot of England players here (at Everton) so hopefully the manager will be coming to watch a lot and that gives me a better chance to show what I can do if I am playing. 

'I just want to get back to playing the way I know I can and get a run of games. 

'You need a run of games to get up to form and that is my aim.

'Spurs have loads of players, a massive squad, and some players go for long periods of time without playing. 

'I think any footballer will tell you when they are not playing it is not enjoyable. 

'If you are not playing sometimes it is best to move on. That was the case for me and it was time for me to move.' 

After stagnating at Tottenham, Lennon was offered the chance of a loan at Everton in January and his short spell at Goodison Park made such an impression on him he made his mind up there was only one place he wanted to move to when the transfer window re-opened.

However, it was not until the last few moments on deadline day - Everton were granted a couple of extra hours to complete the deal - that his ambition was realised. 

It was a bold move holding out for the Toffees when he had chances to go elsewhere but he hopes it will pay off. 

'I made it clear this was the one I wanted - from my loan spell early on I knew this was the club that I wanted to be at,' he added. 

'There were other clubs interested but to be honest I didn't really even entertain it. I just sat there hoping this deal would go through, and thankfully it did. 

'I didn't hear much until the end of the window and then I pretty much knew it was close and obviously it went down to the wire.

He rewatched the “Star Wars” trilogy, which he had not seen in years. 

He read, and very much enjoyed, a book called “Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,” a Jane Austen/pop-culture mashup.

“Star Wars.” Shakespeare. The comedy potential of mashups. 

These ingredients, swirling around in Doescher’s head, ultimately coalesced into a series of seven well-reviewed books that have catapulted Doescher onto best-seller lists.

Here’s a sample from the latest, “William Shakespeare’s Tragedy of the Sith’s Revenge: Star Wars Part the Third” (Quirk Books, $14.95), the conclusion of the fall of the house of Skywalker. The speaker is the Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, talking sense to the aggrieved Anakin (Darth Vader, later a Sith lord):

“It was hard at the beginning,” admits Doescher, 38. He will be here Tuesday for a reading from “The Sith’s Revenge” at Left Bank Books, featuring actors from St. Louis Shakespeare.

Brady seems tired of questions about his age, and is on the record as saying he wants to play past age 40.   And if he keeps playing the way he has through the first three weeks of this season - heck, even if he plays at 75 percent of his current level - it's hard to think Brady won't be piloting an offense for four or five more years.

Gus Bradley defense or not, it's no surprise to see Brady have so much success against the Jaguars - this is, after all, the same franchise he once set an NFL postseason record against, completing 26-of-28 passes (92.9 percent) in the 2008 divisional round.   New England is now 3-0, and Brady is off to a scorching start: he's completing over 72 percent of his passes, is averaging 370 passing yards per, and has nine touchdowns with no interceptions.     In case you're new to this football thing, that's pretty good. Though amazingly, not as good through three games as Brady was in 2007 - that season, through three games, Brady had completed nearly 80 percent of his passes, with 10 touchdowns but one interception. With 133 pass attempts and no picks, Brady on Sunday broke Peyton Manning's record for most consecutive passes without an interception to start a season; Manning opened the 2010 season with 126 passes before being intercepted.   Back then, however, Brady was just 30, and by conventional wisdom was at his athletic peak. At 38, he should be falling off but appears to be as good as he's ever been.   Brady has always been incredibly committed to his game preparation, and in recent years, he's dedicated himself to doing everything possible to keep himself in peak physical and mental condition (avocado ice cream, anyone?).

998509,24373b05-a6fe-4b40-9632-20b92ce2fd70,Fans rally behind the ‘Walias’: 400 Ethiopian football supporters in … – Seychelles News Agency,EthioSun,"( Seychelles News Agency ) – Seychelles will be facing Ethiopia on home turf this Saturday in its second qualifying match for the 2017 African Cup of Nations ( CAN 2017 ). However, the test for the Indian ocean archipelago’s national football team will not be only against 11 players on the field, as the Ethiopian side will be backed by what can be described as the largest group of foreign supporters making their way to the island nation. 
 
 
 
A total of 400 fans of the ‘ Walias ’ as the Ethiopian national side is best known, after the endangered Walia Ibex found in Ethiopia , will be heading to ‘Stad Linite’, the main stadium at Roche Caiman on the outskirts of the Seychelles capital for the match scheduled to start at 4.30pm local time. 
 
 
 
Half of the supporters disembarked at the Seychelles International airport yesterday afternoon, after 5pm onboard a scheduled Ethiopian Dreamliner flight to the island nation. 
 
 
 
The other half arrived onboard a chartered Ethiopian Dreamliner at around 6.15 pm yesterday.

“I love my national team that’s why I have come to support them,” one of the supporters Tewodros Saleshi told SNA at the airport. 
 
 
 
“We hope to win…we will score more than 5 goals,” said another Mengistu Shamebo. 
 
 
 
While those onboard the scheduled flight had capitalized on promotional fares advertised by their national airline the passengers of the chartered flight are winners of a competition organised by the Dutch brewing company, Heineken, which inaugurated its biggest brewery in Ethiopia in January this year. 
 
 
 
According to an article published in August by Ethiopian website, Ethiosports , Heineken inserted marked labels in the cork of its new Walia beer allowing fans who find them the opportunity to fly on an all-expense paid trip Seychelles and support the Walias. 
 
 
 
Hana Fetwi and Hewan Tesfaye are two of those lucky fans , who told SNA that they have been to South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Congo and even Brazil to support their national team. 
 
 
 
“Most of the time we would pay for tickets, for everything but this time it’s Walia that sponsored us. I hope we win,” they both told SNA.

Arrangements were made before hand to accommodate the largest group of football  fans coming to the island nation as their team plays the Seychelles side as they have been booked in several hotels mainly along the northern coast of Mahé. 
 
 
 
“ Ethiopian Airlines arranges for charter flights to fans from different countries when requested. We have previously arranged such charters for the Ugandan, Nigerian, Burkina Faso, Ghanaian and Qatari fans to different tournaments,” Meseret Tekalign, the Ethiopian Airline Base Manager in Seychelles, explained to SNA in an email interview. 
 
 
 
“Of course we are capable of arranging such charter flights for Seychellois on the return game who would like to watch the match on the return game.”

The 400 Ethiopians will only be spending two days in Seychelles, as they go back on Sunday but this is also being viewed as an opportunity to promote the island nation as a tourist destination. 
 
 
 
“They [the fans ] will have the chance to experience the hospitality of Seychelles. [The] flights serve as a very good opportunity to create awareness and publicity of Seychelles as a tourist destination for travelers in Ethiopia and the world. This will create personal experience for many Ethiopians,” said Tekalign. 
 
 
 
This view is equally shared by the Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St Ange who was at the airport to welcome the fans who arrived onboard the chartered flight. 
 
 
 
“When they land at the airport its sports tourism , on the field it will be purely sports….To see 400 Ethiopians land in Seychelles at the same time on two different planes is remarkable for Seychelles that has been able to attract a sports team playing an international game that has attracted 400 fans to Seychelles,” said St Ange. 
 
 
 
“These people are coming to spend their money and having fun…the football match is in the afternoon but these people will be going to the beach, to a bar and will be in Victoria enjoying themselves and Seychelles will surely reap benefits out of this.”

Going back to the CAN 2017 qualifiers, Seychelles has been drawn in Group J alongside Algeria, Ethiopia and Lesotho. The encounter against Ethiopia will be another tough test for the island nation boys after they lost their first qualifying match 4-0 against Algeria in June . 
 
 
 
Seychelles’ performance in several international competitions this year have not proven quite successful and the national team also relinquished its Indian Ocean title at the recent Indian ocean Island Games held in Reunion island last month. 
 
 
 
For this Saturday’s match the Seychelles side will be under the guidance and coaching of Bruno Saindini of Madagascan origin but residing and playing football in Seychelles for many years. As the caretaker coach appointed to see the team through this match only, Saindini will be assisted by Seychellois Rodney Choisy. 
 
 
 
In an interview with SNA earlier this week Choisy said that the 20 man team playing for Seychelles today comprises of 7 new players called to the squad. 
 
 
 
“We were focusing on the tactics in the last days leading up to the game…the players are in good spirit and are looking forward to a good match,” said Choisy. 
 
 
 
In an interview with daily newspaper Seychelles Nation published this Saturday, Saindini described the game as a big test although he said the team was ready for the challenge. 
 
 
 
According to the world’s football governing body, FIFA’s latest ranking , Seychelles is positioned 192 nd worldwide and 50 th in Africa while Ethiopia ranks 103 rd worldwide and 29 th in Africa. 
 
 
 
Playing home in their first CAN 2017 qualifying match against Lesotho in June this year, Ethiopia’s Walias , came out victorious winning the match 2 – 1. 
 
 
 
After today Seychelles will have another 4 group matches to play.  
 
 
 
52 of the 54 member countries of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) have been divided into 13 different group for the CAN 2017 qualifiers.  
 
 
 
The teams that will qualify for the next African Cup of Nations which will be played in Gabon between the months of January and February 2017 will include the winners of each of the 13 groups. 
 
 
 
The two best-placed runners-up in each group will also book a place at the tournament except the group which contains the host country, Gabon, whose matches will be considered friendlies and where only the winner will qualify. 
 
 
 
The African Cup of Nations is held every two years. The defending champion is Cote D’Ivoire that won the competition in Equatorial Guinea in February this year.

  Gloria de Piero recalled the legacy of Keir Hardie in creating a political party to represent workers in Parliament   
Doubts have been raised over the possibility of Labour winning in 2020 following the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader, with Labour figures warning he may turn them into a ""party of protest"". 

			 
Ms de Piero, t he shadow minister for young people and voter registration, told the party's conference in Brighton: ""We are Labour because we want to change people's lives. But we know we can't change a single life without being in government. 



 
""Conference debates and members' rallies, they energise us and they motivate us, but only by debating with the public and by rallying voters can we change lives. 

""Only by winning power locally and nationally can we change lives. 

""Keir Hardie died 100 years ago yesterday. His historic legacy was the creation of a political party that sought representation for labour in Parliament. Labour exists to win power, there is no virtue in opposition."" 

Ms de Piero also poked fun at Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. 

			 
She joked: ""Lord Ashcroft has taught us a thing or two about the Prime Minister's upbringing. 

""It's fair to say David Cameron and I had different starts in life. Apparently he was sipping champagne on Concorde aged 11. My family were on benefits and I ate free school meals -  but we did have some things in common.

""They had some interesting initiation ceremonies, but I had to share a flat with Tom Watson.  I don't know who had the worst deal."" 

Shadow women and equalities minister Kate Green also insisted Labour would ""campaign and resist"" Government measures that ""hold back progress on equality"". 

She said: "" We will toughen up the law on hate crime. 

""We will not tolerate the abuse and contempt suffered by those who rely on our welfare state and are stigmatised as scroungers. 

			 
""And we will call out the language of division - because we are a united country."" 

Ms Green also said: ""Parliament continues to be an institution designed by men, for men.  Securing equal representation at every level in elected office must be Labour's task."" 

Earlier, a male-dominated panel greeted delegates as the Labour conference started in the main hall. 

One female delegate could be heard shouting: "" There are six men on that platform and one woman."" 

The woman continued speaking but her further comments were inaudible due to applause from fellow delegates.

With Ed Miliband in power as minister of state, it"," on at Westminster:

Theresa May suggested last month her personal favourite was getting along OK – although neither David Cameron nor Philip Hammond claimed ever having seen such love among Tory voters before becoming prime ministers too... Mrs May once joked 'You don't talk so hard about everything you care'. Despite appearing fidgety afterwards speaking out against foreign policy differences Theresa May had never used adjectives deliberately or simply stating which side will win - indeed what does Britain stand by now might actually differ slightly across many aspects… This approach reveals some serious flaws within British politics since recent times; something Mr Gordon-on must realise all work needs to come first..

NOT GREAT, BOB. Son Heung-Min has played an important role in Tottenham's recent string of consecutive wins, scoring three goals in four matches and helping to revitalize Spurs' attack this season. He's important to the team, and any suggestion of injury, even if minor, gives me the heebie-jeebies.

Now, this tweet doesn't give us any context for the information, nor does it say how severe the injury might be. Sonny was subbed off at the 77th minute for Clinton N'Jie, but there were no indications at the time that the substitution was injury related. So right now we have no idea as to the severity of his foot problem.

 Photographer Delia Blackburn was preparing to photograph the bride, 21-year-old Brittany Peck, walk down the aisle at her Elyria, Ohio, wedding last Saturday, when Peck’s biological father, Todd Bachman, stole the show. 
 
Bachman, who split from Peck’s mother in 2000, drove his daughter down to the aisle at the outdoor ceremony in a decorated golf cart. When they got to the moment that he was supposed to walk Peck down the aisle, Bachman instead left his daughter at the golf cart. 

Bachman walked down the aisle by himself to grab the hand of Peck’s stepfather, Todd Cendrosky, who was sitting in one of the first rows with other family members. Cendrosky married Peck’s mother in 2003 and had helped to raise the bride. 
Delia D. Blackburn Photography Brittany Peck's wedding photos have gone viral after her father grabbed her stepfather so they could both walk her down the aisle.  
“I’d always known that I wanted both of them to walk me down the aisle but I had no idea how to tell my dad,” Peck told ABC News from her honeymoon in Tennessee. “I finally just built up the courage to call him about two weeks before the wedding and said, ‘I really need to talk to you.’” 

“He said, ‘You don’t have to say anything more. I already have a plan for everything. I know what you want. Don’t you worry about it. I’ve got it covered,’” Peck recalled. 

Peck’s dad, Bachman, kept his plan to bring Cendrosky to also walk Peck down the aisle close to his heart, telling no one, including the bride. 
Delia D. Blackburn Photography Brittany Peck's wedding photos have gone viral after her father grabbed her stepfather so they could both walk her down the aisle.  
“I gave them both a big hug and it was such an emotional time in my life,” Peck said of her own reaction. 

The moment was even more touching because Peck’s parents had been locked in a custody battle for much of her childhood. 

“My parents could not agree on custody of me and my little sister,” she said. “I had my own lawyer and it was very, very bad. It could be a Lifetime movie with all that we’ve been through.” 

Peck says her two “dads,” as she calls them both, now, years later, get along fine, but the decision of who would walk her down the aisle had been weighing heavily on them all. 
Delia D. Blackburn Photography Brittany Peck's wedding photos have gone viral after her father grabbed her stepfather so they could both walk her down the aisle.  
“My stepdad was just so upset,” Peck said of Cendrosky. “He literally would cry everyday leading up to the wedding because he knew he would just sit in the crowd.”

I already have a plan for everything. I know what you want. Don’t you worry about it. I’ve got it covered,’” Peck recalled. Peck’s dad, Bachman, kept his plan to bring Cendrosky to also walk Peck down the aisle close to his heart, telling no one, including the bride. Delia D. Blackburn Photography Brittany Peck's wedding photos have gone viral after her father grabbed her stepfather so they could both walk her down the aisle. “I gave them both a big hug and it was such an emotional time in my life,” Peck said of her own reaction. The moment was even more touching because Peck’s parents had been locked in a custody battle for much of her childhood. “My parents could not agree on custody of me and my little sister,” she said. “I had my own lawyer and it was very, very bad. It could be a Lifetime movie with all that we’ve been through.” Peck says her two “dads,” as she calls them both, now, years later, get along fine, but the decision of who would walk her down the aisle had been weighing heavily on them all.

Runaway 
 
Peter May 
 
Quercus 
 
HAVING enjoyed breakout bestseller success with stories set on islands of various degrees of remoteness — the Lewis Trilogy and the Canadian set Entry Island — Peter May goes urban with a story based on an episode from his own life. 
 
As a teenager in the 1960s, May and his mates ran away from Glasgow to try and make a name for themselves on the Swinging London music scene. 
 
In Runaway , the Glasgow-born but French resident author takes that ill-fated adventure as a starting point, moves the action back a few years to the early 1960s and, because his books appear in the crime section of the bookshop, adds in a murder. 
 
Actually, the murder element, introduced in a grim but largely unnecessary prologue, is the least satisfying element of the book. Of the 60-something survivors who decide to retrace their journey to London in the wake of the killing, one is already well aware who the murderer is and why the crime is committed, so the murder mystery element is largely redundant, 
 
But that does not mean the story is lacking in suspense as the naïve teenagers and the tired and disillusioned men they become make their journey to London half a century apart. Yet somewhere within the heavy-hearted Jack Mackay and his companions, the heavy drinking Dave and the dying Maurie are the remnants of the hopeful and adventurous teenagers they once were. 
 
As innocent and clueless as Jack and his friends were as teens, they still bear favoutrable comparison with the modern generation as personified by Jack’s grandson Ricky. Intelligent but spoiled and squandering his abilities and opportunities in favour of an online existence in front of a games console, he is blackmailed into taking the aging delinquents to London, in the process discovering that his grandfather is not the sad loser his father has painted him. 
 
A coming of age story disguised as a thriller, it also has an important message for those at the other end of the life cycle with an optimistic coda that offers the hope it is never too late for second chances. 
 
May’s journalistic background helps him conjure up a convincing picture of London as it was about to swing with a couple of cheeky cameos from real life figures, including possibly a leading member of a certain Liverpool beat combo. 
 
Not as dark as his Lewis Trilogy or as intense as his China thrillers, this is a nice change of pace from the always impressive May.

630684,bae602dd-088e-475a-b952-a18f26604d8f,Meet the Danish Architect Who Designed Two World Trade Center,Complex,"Bjarke Ingels, one of the world's up-and-coming architects, has been tapped by Rupert Murdoch to be the head of design for the new building to be constructed at Two World Trade Center. The top half of the new construction will be home to some of Murdoch's media holdings, including 21st Century Fox Media and News. That's right, for better or for worse, Fox News' shiny new offices will now feature large and expansive lofty news rooms with windows overlooking World Trade Plaza.  

 
Ingels' new design firm is called BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group), which was born out of Copenhagen and recently expanded to New York, where he now holds a staff of 170. Ingels couldn't have picked a more fitting name for his company, because this new endeavor will plop a massive 80-story asymmetrical skyscraper right in the heart of the bustling Financial District. The yet-to-be-approved designs depict a building that is seemingly teetering on the verge of collapse from certain vantage points, which has been both a strength and weakness in terms of its appeal as it has been shown around to those in charge of its funding and approval. While the effort seems excessive and risky to some who favor a more traditional form of square-foundation-based buildings, especially for something as important and iconic as a World Trade Center building, Ingels says he has been able to solve this problem by simply ""redistributing the calories.""  

 
Ingels has already racked up a couple of big gigs in the city, including the massive project of building a new 10-mile long park surrounding lower Manhattan, meant to provide new support against the possibility of future damage from hurricanes. The park will cost the city a whopping $335 million, which is a small price to pay for what the project is meant to do for the city in the long run. After Hurricane Sandy , the city suffered from $19 billion in lost revenue and sustained property damage to various buildings and infrastructure, and Ingels' job will be to assure that this new park not only provides new open spaces and public facilities for the city's residents, but also assures something as catastrophic does not happen again.  

 
Ingels has also been selected to design Google's new headquarters, comprised of many greenhouse-like domes surrounded by large lawns and winding bike paths.  BIG's future, as Ingels describes it, is to ""be both pragmatic and utopian."" The plan is to bring solutions to corporations that defy the conventional standards of bland and brutalist architecture for something more inviting and groundbreaking, while still serving a specific company's needs. He has dismissed the notion that an architect must adhere to a single personal style, and this mindset has allowed him to whip up some of the most unique designs for some of the world's most recent ambitious construction efforts.

Last school year, a student at one of her schools experienced a life-threatening allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, upon trying rye bread for the first time, not knowing she had a food allergy. Fortunately, the school nurse on staff recognized the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and immediately administered an EpiPen ® (epinephrine injection) Auto-Injector. 

Food allergies, a common cause of anaphylaxis, are on the rise in the U.S., affecting an estimated one in 13 children. Like the student described above, up to 25% of anaphylaxis cases in schools occur in children without a previous allergy diagnosis. For this reason, ensuring access to undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors – epinephrine auto-injectors that aren’t prescribed to a particular student or staff member – is a key priority for facilitators and nurses alike. 

EpiPen4Schools ® , a free, nationwide program offered by Mylan, provides four free EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® (epinephrine injection) Auto-Injectors to qualifying* schools in the U.S. 
 The schools Connie serves have participated in the EpiPen4Schools ® program since it launched in 2012, and, in this past school year alone, EpiPen ® Auto-Injectors provided through the program were used in two incidents. Connie and her team understand anaphylaxis can happen for the first time at school, so having both individually-prescribed and undesignated epinephrine in every nurse’s office is important. 
“My team of nurses and I know that anaphylaxis is unpredictable; life happens, so you’ve got to be prepared,” explained Trent. “It’s essential to have an anaphylaxis action plan, which includes avoiding known allergens, recognizing the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, being ready to administer an epinephrine auto-injector, and seeking immediate emergency medical care should anaphylaxis occur.” 

Recent legislation has improved epinephrine access in the school setting by allowing or requiring schools in many states to stock epinephrine auto-injectors. To date, 47 states have enacted laws or policies allowing or requiring schools to stock undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors. 

To learn more about the EpiPen4Schools ® program visit EpiPen4Schools.com . 

Final Tip from Connie : Early in the school year, parents should be sure to check the expiration date on their child's EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® Auto-Injectors and obtain a prescription for additional EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® Auto-Injectors if needed in key locations such as home, school or for after-school activities. 

Connie Trent is a spokesperson of Mylan. 

*A school will only receive EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® Auto-Injectors in accordance with all applicable laws. Requirements to qualify for this offer include having a valid prescription. There is no requirement for a school to purchase additional EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® Auto-Injectors.

Indications 
EpiPen ® (epinephrine injection) 0.3 mg and EpiPen Jr ® (epinephrine injection) 0.15 mg Auto-Injectors are for the emergency treatment of life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) caused by allergens, exercise, or unknown triggers; and for people who are at increased risk for these reactions. EpiPen ® and EpiPen Jr ® are intended for immediate administration as emergency supportive therapy only. Seek immediate emergency medical help right away. 

Important Safety Information 
EpiPen ® and EpiPen Jr ® Auto-Injectors contain a single dose of epinephrine, which you (or your caregiver or others who may be in a position to administer EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® ) inject into the middle of your outer thigh (upper leg) (through clothing, if necessary). Get emergency medical help right away. You may need further medical attention. Only a health care professional should give additional doses of epinephrine if you need more than two injections for a single anaphylactic episode. DO NOT INJECT INTO YOUR VEINS, BUTTOCKS, FINGERS, TOES, HANDS OR FEET. In case of accidental injection, please seek immediate medical treatment. Epinephrine should be used with caution if you have heart disease or are taking certain medicines that can cause heart-related (cardiac) symptoms. 

Tell your doctor if you have certain medical conditions such as asthma, depression, thyroid disease, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease, have any other medical conditions, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Be sure to also tell your doctor all the medicines you take, especially medicines for asthma. If you have certain medical conditions, or take certain medicines, your condition may get worse or you may have longer lasting side effects when you use EpiPen ® or EpiPen Jr ® . 

The most common side effects may include increase in heart rate, stronger or irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea or vomiting, difficulty breathing, paleness, dizziness, weakness, shakiness, headache, apprehension, nervousness or anxiety. These side effects may go away if you rest. Tell your health care professional if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

Thanks to a week of great preparation and a day of near-perfect execution, the Patriots were never in a place to lose against the Jaguars. The game was out of hand pretty early on as the Patriots never fell below a 99% chance of winning in the 2nd half. It let people have free range of Twitter. I'm thankful.

Not even Bruce Armstrong's records are safe from Tom Brady.
— Jeff Howe (@jeffphowe) September 27, 2015






Cheers to the Patriots quarterback who tied the former left tackle with 212 games in a New England uniform. Armstrong has his number 78 retired by the franchise, even though he's not in the NFL Hall of Fame. He's an all timer.

And Brady will pass the record 212 games with his next game. Sorry, Bruce.

Walt ""Tuck Rule"" Coleman working the game today.
— Christopher Price (@cpriceNFL) September 27, 2015






The last time Coleman officiated an Oakland Raiders game was the Tuck Rule game in the Patriots storybook Super Bowl run. He has reffed 16 Patriots games since that point in time.

It was a picture perfect scenario with former Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon in the booth calling the game, and with Blake Bortles fumbling a pass attempt for a first down that might have been categorized under the Tuck Rule if it were still in effect. For the record, Bill Belichick says that the officials got the call correct with the review.

Well the Jaguars are trying the ""don't cover Gronk"" method, too.
— Lee Schechter (@LeeSchechter) September 27, 2015






Hack a Shaq defense on Gronkowski right now. Someone's going to get hurt.
— PatriotsSB50 (@PatriotsSB49) September 27, 2015






Teams still have no idea how they're going to cover Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. The Jaguars run a lot of zone, so Tom Brady would just motion receivers to draw away defensive backs and Gronk just ran into the openings for big gains. It's kind of simple.

The issue comes towards the red zone when the defense gets a little more congested. Defenses are just trying to beat up Gronk, which is kind of what the Patriots used to do to Tony Gonzalez when they didn't have a player who could cover him 1-on-1.

If officials are calling Gronkowski for offensive pass interference, hopefully they'll start to consistently call defensive pass interference. They made the right call on the goal line, when the Jaguars thought they made an interception, just a week after officials missed Jerry Hughes trying to get a piggy back up the seam.

Blake Bortles threw a dropped pick to Butler on second down and then ""fumbled"" the ball forward for a first down on third down, so progress
— Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) September 27, 2015






The Patriots did a great job of stymieing the Jaguars attack. Outside of a big touchdown pass from Bortles to Allen Hurns, it didn't seem like the Jaguars could figure out anything on offense. It wasn't like the Patriots were doing anything excessively complicated, either. They mixed up their coverages, they mixed up their pressures, they focused on stopping the run, and they took away Bortles' favorite target in Allen Robinson.

That was basically it. When Bortles couldn't throw at Robinson, the Patriots pressure started to get home and the Jaguars quarterback had to make a bad throw at his second or third read. That was all she wrote.

Patriots points: 51. Jaguars plays: 48.
— Kevin Duffy (@KevinRDuffy) September 27, 2015






That's just total dominance by the Patriots offense and defense. It involves a super efficient offense and a smothering defense that forced the Jaguars off the field early and often.

— Rich Hill (@PP_Rich_Hill) September 27, 2015






 

Sorry to the Dolphins. They were the target of plenty of jokes after they lost to the Jaguars and were absolutely taken to the woodshed by the Bills. So much for my AFC East runner-up pick.

I know it's early in the season, and that while most Patriots fans want an easy cruise to the division title, there's some aspect of fandom that wants the rest of the division to be good. They want the Patriots to win every game walking away, but they want the Bills and Dolphins to destroy opposing divisions, and for the Jets to finish 0-16. That's just the way it is.

Part of that desire is connected to the debate about divisional strength. Oh, the AFC East is weak, they say, the Patriots haven't had any competition in the division. We know that's wrong, but we want everyone else to see it, too. Watching the Jaguars beat the Dolphins feels like a hollow joke in The Daily Show where you laugh because of how devastating the truth actually remains.

The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars. The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars. The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars.

It's less and less funny every time I read it.

NE 51-10 -- most points allowed #Jaguars history.  Enough said.

— Ben Volin (@BenVolin) September 27, 2015






But how about the Patriots? They're off to one of the best starts in team history, and there's a lot of really great starts under Bill Belichick. But actually...

Did you know that this was just the fifth time in Belichick's 16 seasons as head coach that the Patriots opened up 3-0 (02, 04, 07, 13, 15).

The Patriots have only started 4-0 three other times under Belichick (04, 07, 13).

Just two Patriots teams have started 5-0 and 6-0 (04, 07).

Only the 2007 Patriots have reached the 7-0 mark under Belichick.

It's a long season. The Patriots are better in the second half of the season than they are in the first half. Only two Patriots teams (04, 07) posted a 7-1 or 8-0 record in the first half of the season, but seven teams (01, 03, 04, 07, 10, 11, 12) have closed out the year 7-1 or 8-0, and that's not including the Patriots resting their starters in the final week.

I've studied/played against this Pats offense for a long time, & through 3 wks this might be the most methodical & efficient I've seen them.

But I'm also about 9 beers in at the top of the 4th, so my judgement may be a little cloudy. :-)

They mixed up their coverages, they mixed up their pressures, they focused on stopping the run, and they took away Bortles' favorite target in Allen Robinson. That was basically it. When Bortles couldn't throw at Robinson, the Patriots pressure started to get home and the Jaguars quarterback had to make a bad throw at his second or third read. That was all she wrote. Patriots points: 51. Jaguars plays: 48. — Kevin Duffy (@KevinRDuffy) September 27, 2015 That's just total dominance by the Patriots offense and defense. It involves a super efficient offense and a smothering defense that forced the Jaguars off the field early and often.

They were the target of plenty of jokes after they lost to the Jaguars and were absolutely taken to the woodshed by the Bills. So much for my AFC East runner-up pick. I know it's early in the season, and that while most Patriots fans want an easy cruise to the division title, there's some aspect of fandom that wants the rest of the division to be good. They want the Patriots to win every game walking away, but they want the Bills and Dolphins to destroy opposing divisions, and for the Jets to finish 0-16. That's just the way it is. Part of that desire is connected to the debate about divisional strength. Oh, the AFC East is weak, they say, the Patriots haven't had any competition in the division. We know that's wrong, but we want everyone else to see it, too. Watching the Jaguars beat the Dolphins feels like a hollow joke in The Daily Show where you laugh because of how devastating the truth actually remains. The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars. The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars. The Dolphins lost to the Jaguars. It's less and less funny every time I read it. NE 51-10 -- most points allowed #Jaguars history. Enough said. — Ryan O'Halloran (@ryanohalloran) September 27, 2015 Brady could have had at least 5 TDs today if the Patriots didn't have any decency. 2007 was way more fun. — Michael Hurley (@michaelFhurley) September 27, 2015 Remember that story by ESPN's Kelly Naqi during DeFlategate? .. Her husband is currently an executive with the Jaguars... #Patriots — Mike Loyko (@NEPD_Loyko) September 27, 2015 119 points through three games is a #Patriots record. Previous high was 115 in 2002 — Ben Volin (@BenVolin) September 27, 2015 But how about the Patriots? They're off to one of the best starts in team history, and there's a lot of really great starts under Bill Belichick. But actually... Did you know that this was just the fifth time in Belichick's 16 seasons as head coach that the Patriots opened up 3-0 (02, 04, 07, 13, 15). The Patriots have only started 4-0 three other times under Belichick (04, 07, 13). Just two Patriots teams have started 5-0 and 6-0 (04, 07). Only the 2007 Patriots have reached the 7-0 mark under Belichick. It's a long season. The Patriots are better in the second half of the season than they are in the first half. Only two Patriots teams (04, 07) posted a 7-1 or 8-0 record in the first half of the season, but seven teams (01, 03, 04, 07, 10, 11, 12) have closed out the year 7-1 or 8-0, and that's not including the Patriots resting their starters in the final week. I've studied/played against this Pats offense for a long time, & through 3 wks this might be the most methodical & efficient I've seen them. — Scott Fujita (@sfujita55) September 27, 2015 But I'm also about 9 beers in at the top of the 4th, so my judgement may be a little cloudy. :-) — Scott Fujita (@sfujita55) September 27, 2015 We appreciate the sentiment from a key member of the NFL Players Association.

I think that can only be chalked up perfectly by Bill Belichick himself being so determined during his time running this team once they lost last night but what you're going through is nothing short (including my thoughts). Just imagine how difficult it would sometimes become following all those losses while reading about these things happening around here already today…and if we don't get anything done then maybe someday when there will truly start looking at ""this thing"" first i'll probably stop worrying very much one way or another just because now everyone sees me telling them such stories every single morning trying not keep hearing myself lol"

Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald said: ""What we have seen is heart-breaking and tragic and I think it demands the most comprehensive response. 
 
""I think it will be in the thousands. It's very hard to put a precise figure on it. We want to respond in as humanitarian a way as possible."" 
 
Ms Fitzgerald said if European leaders agree to increase the number of refugees being accepted across the bloc to 150,000, it will effectively treble Ireland's commitment to the crisis. 
 
While British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed the UK will take thousands more people from camps on the borders of war-torn Syria. 
 
He said he would set out details of the plans next week. 
 
The premiers made the announcements as the United Nations high commissioner called for Europe to draw up a common mass relocation plan for 200,000 refugees – the worst crisis of its kind since World War II. 
 
 “Given the scale of the crisis and the suffering of people, today I can announce that we will do more, providing resettlement for thousands more Syrian refugees,” he said. 
 
""We will continue with our approach of taking them from the refugee camps. This provides them with a more direct and safe route to the United Kingdom, rather than risking the hazardous journey which has tragically cost so many their lives."" 
 
The PM said that Britain was already ""providing sanctuary"" to around 5,000 refugees from the camps, and had provided around £900 million in aid - more than any other European country. 
 
A spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency suggested the UK will take 4,000 more people from Syria, through this was not confirmed by Downing Street. 
 
Images of the body of a Syrian toddler being carried from the shores of Turkey have put the refugee crisis in the spotlight in recent days. 
 
Three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, his five-year-old brother Galip and their mother, Rihan all drowned off the coast of Bodrum. 
 
This crisis is unfolding right across Europe with nations coming under increasing pressure. In Hungary, refugees and migrants, were forced off a train bound for Austria, by the country's riot police on Thursday. 
 
Northern Ireland’s deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, has been responding to calls for local politicians to intervene – and said the region ""could take a couple of thousand refugees"" at first. 
 
Speaking on UTV Live Tonight, Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson stressed that those involved are seeking refuge while their homes are too dangerous to stay in. 
 
Martin Anderson, Sinn Féin MEP: “There’s 16 and a half million refugees, and the lion’s share of them got Pakistan, Jordan and Lebanon. 
 
“Only 15% of them seek to come into the US, Canada, Australia and 28 member states [of the EU], only 15% of them. 
 
“They don’t come to developed countries, they go to neighbouring countries because they want to go home, they want to go home at some stage when this is all over.” 
 


SDLP MP Mark Durkan welcomed the commitment from both governments and called for a special meeting of the British-Irish Council to help co-ordinate action on accommodation of refugees across the jurisdictions and all of their relevant services. 
 
“Given that the government has moved so slowly to this stage – and also in relation to its earlier commitment to accept refugees – we will want to see active and early follow-through on this announcement. 
 
“In the wake of today’s decisions by both the British and Irish governments to allow thousands more Syrian refugees to resettle in the UK and Ireland, I would call for a special meeting of the British-Irish Council. 
 
“Indeed, such a meeting could bring together all administrations in these islands to help co-ordinate action on accommodation across the jurisdictions and all of their relevant services.” 
 
Ulster Unionist MEP, Jim Nicholson, welcomed the Prime Minister’s statement on the refugee crisis, and his repeated calls for a co-ordinated European approach to the humanitarian situation. 
 
“The images in our newspapers and on our television screens have brought home to many the reality of the situation facing refugees fleeing atrocities in Syria and across the Middle East,” he said. 
 
“There is a great need to respond positively to this human tragedy with both a measured and compassionate approach. I therefore welcome the Prime Minister’s statement today and his remarks that the UK should act with its head and heart. 
 
“We also need a co-ordinated European approach, and I await with interest European Commission President Juncker’s address to the European Parliament on the matter next week."" 
 
Hundreds of people have joined a solidarity page on Facebook to coordinate fundraising and giving aid in Northern Ireland. Appeals have been made for people to donate tents, clothing, toiletries and basic medical kits. 
 
Kat Coen, a coordinating member of Belfast Calais Refugee Solidarity said:  “Like so many others I’m appalled by the refugee crisis and the death and suffering of so many people, and like many others I felt helpless in the face of government inaction.   
 
“However, we are not helpless.  Each one of us can donate time, money and much needed items like clothes, tents and so on to be sent to people in desperate need.”

868013,81742626-e299-4a37-95ab-7f4c98fd8150,The Isley Brothers’ Essential Library – 23-CD Box Set Collection is Historic,EURweb,"For the past seven decades, “ The Isley Brothers ” – the legendary and iconic “Isley Brothers” – have recorded a plethora of R&B/rock/pop/funk songs and music that have reverberated through the recorded music industry like no other musical entity, in any genre, at any point in the 120-plus-year history of recorded music. 
 
Simply put, there has never been a major recording artist or recording group – black, white or of any other ethnicity – other than “The Isley Brothers” with Ronald Isley, that can truthfully state and prove to have charted hit records in every decade since the 1950s. 
 
On Friday, August, 21, 2015, a significant portion of the group’s discography came to life again, when Legacy Recordings (Sony/BMG) released, “The Isley Brothers:  The RCA Victor and T-Neck Album Masters (1959 – 1983) 23-CD Box Set.”  The extensive collection, according to Ernie Isley, longtime guitarist with “The Isley Brothers,” includes dozens of the group’s hit songs and some surprises. 
 
“They looked under every rock and everyplace else to find some of this music,” said Ernie, with a huge laugh.  “There’s some songs that’s been released, and some versions of songs that’s never been released or heard before by listeners.  There’s some things that I haven’t heard in decades.” 
 
The 23-CD box set contains the first-ever unabridged version of the 1980 live studio album that was recorded in Bearsville Studios near Woodstock, New York, which includes such songs as “Don’t Say Goodnight (It’s Time for Love),” “Fight the Power,” “Summer Breeze” and a medley featuring “Hello it’s Me” and “Footsteps in the Dark.” 
 
According to producers’ notes written by Leo Sacks and Jeffrey James, the project for CBS was slated to be released on the group’s T-Neck Records label in 1980, but never saw the light of day.  Other recordings unearthed are tracks from “The Isley Brothers Live at Yankee Stadium,” which also includes musical performances by “The Edwin Hawkins Singers,” “The Brooklyn Bridge,” “The Five Stairsteps,” and others. 
 
For those who were fortunate enough to listen to advanced copies of the collection, the CD Box set is being called “a definitive collection of songs and music that chronicles the evolution and brilliance of the world’s most prolific recording ensemble.” 
 

 
In essence, the 23-CD box set musically chronicles “The Isley Brothers” (Ronald, Rudolph, and O’Kelly) from their gospel/doo-wop singing/recording days in the ‘50s.  It begins with CD 1, which contains their 1959 hit “Shout” (Part 1 and 2).  Other songs of interest on CD 1 include “When the Saints Go Marching in,” “St. Louis Blues,” “He’s Got the While World in His Hands,” and more. 
 
While all 84 of the songs on the 23-CD collection can’t be listed, it’s worth mentioning there are classic songs/hits, inclusive of, “It’s Your Thing,” “I Know Who You Been Socking it to” “I Turned You On,”  “Testify” (Part 1 & 2) “Ohio/Machine Gun,”  “Fire and Rain,” “Lay Lady Lay,” “Pop That Thang,” “Lay-Away,” “It’s Too Late,” “Harvest for The World,”  “At Your Best (You Are Love),” “Footsteps in the Dark” (Part 1 & 2), “Between the Sheets,” and many more… 
 
While the music of “The Isley Brothers” has been labeled pure brilliance, the history of this “human music machine” is intriguing, as well.  “The Isley Brothers” – O’Kelly, Rudolph, Ronald and Vernon – began performing as a gospel group in the early 1950s in their native hometown of Cincinnati.  Vernon died a few years after the group was formed.  His loss impacted the surviving three brothers so much that they considered disbanding. 
 

 
Following a move to New York years later, the trio, in the late 1950s, switched their genre of singing from gospel to a doo-wop/classic pop mode.  They recorded a few regional hits records.  Things changed for “The Isley Brothers” when their song “Shout” insanely climbed the national music charts.  Followed by several moderately successful songs, the group struck hard again with its Top 20 single, “Twist & Shout,” which was later covered by “The Beatles.” 
 
In the early 1960s, “The Isley Brothers” employed a guitarist that helped the group shape its flair for rock/soul laden songs.  The guitarist, while not widely known at the time, was Jimmy James, better known as Jimi Hendrix. 
 
“People don’t realize that ‘The Isley Brothers’ bought Jimi Hendrix his first guitar, and when he went into the recording studio for the first time in his life, it was with ‘The Isley Brothers,” said Ernie Isley. 
 
While young Ernie Isley was just a kid, having daily access to Hendrix for years allowed the youngster to observe every aspect of the guitarist’s evolving musical talents.  Years later, Ernie would adopt a “Hendrix-ism” style of playing the electric guitar, even to this day.  Interestingly, Ernie didn’t play guitar during the time Hendrix lived and played with “The Isley Brothers.”  Ernie’s first instrument was the drums. 
 
“I played my first live gig with my brothers when I was 14 years old,” Isley recalled.  “It was in Philadelphia and I played drums, because the group’s drummer had quit. That same night in Philly, I played drums behind “Martha Reeves and The Vandellas” because they didn’t have a drummer.  So I got the chance to play on ‘Dancing in the Streets’ and ‘Heatwave.’ ” 
 
Believing that record companies, such as Atlantic, United Artists and Motown, didn’t truly understand “The Isley Brothers’ ” evolving “multi-genre” exploration of rock, R&B, pop, and soul, the group formed its own independent record label called T-Neck Records.  The 23-CD box collection contains many of the group’s work on T-Neck, inclusive of such smash hits as “Love the One You’re With,” “Lay, Lady, Lay” and “That Lady.” 
 
The unique vocalizations of Ronald, Rudolph, and O’Kelley were now augmented by the musical and vocal talents of younger brothers Ernie (lead guitar and drums), Marvin (bass guitar) and Rudolph’s brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards/synthesizers).  Jasper, a classical-trained musician with a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts/music composition from C.W. Post, was instrumental in writing, co-writing and/or arranging many of the songs that branded the group, beginning in the late 1960s, in ways that other groups could not emulate.

Jasper, a classical-trained musician with a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts/music composition from C.W.

484987,58c90a48-ffc0-4ca0-b02d-8d5c6ec8a864,Heartland businesses must innovate to stay relevant: Tharman,If Only Singaporeans Stopped to Think,"By Marissa Lee, The Straits Times, 26 Sep 2015
Heartland businesses are a key thread in Singapore's social fabric but they have to do more if they are to remain at the heart of the future economy, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam yesterday.
Speaking at the Singapore Heartland Enterprise Star awards, he said: ""In order to make sure that heartland enterprises are part of our future, we have to make sure that they are able to innovate and survive.""
And small businesses must be a source of innovation as Singapore presses forth with its ""restructuring journey"", he added.
""We must focus more on real innovations, not just simple solutions such as purchases of basic IT devices like laptops and other devices,"" he said at the event, which was held at the Shangri-La Hotel.
The annual event was organised by the Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore and the Lianhe Wanbao daily.
Mr Tharman also urged leaders of small businesses to focus more on developing the labour force. ""That is our most important objective - to enable everyone to discover their potential and feel fulfilled. It is only by developing our people in each enterprise that we can get get real value from our investments."" He also singled out a few of the winners of this year's awards for their innovative approaches to traditional businesses. Mr Tharman cited incense and candle company Lijay Tradings, which was named the most innovative firm after growing its sales by creating fruit-shaped incense products to attract younger customers. Herbal hair treatment firm Bee Choo Origin was also lauded by Mr Tharman as an ""old economy"" business that has gone global.
""Madam Cheah Bee Chew started the business 15 years ago at home in Pasir Ris, with one steamer,"" said Mr Tharman. The firm now has six outlets and sells hair products in 10 countries after securing international certification to improve its management system. It also tapped on a government grant to fund a project to reduce customers' waiting times. The Government will help firms which genuinely want to innovate by stepping up ""targeted help"" for them, instead of using a ""broad-based"" approach, Mr Tharman said. But he also urged firms not to abuse initiatives, such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme, which are meant to help companies increase productivity through new technology and innovation. He said there was a ""surge"" in the formation of sole proprietorships and partnerships last year as many firms sought to take advantage of the PIC scheme, as well as cases of businesses sharing employees for the purpose of claiming PIC cash payouts.

""We must focus more on real innovations, not just simple solutions such as purchases of basic IT devices like laptops and other devices,"" he said at the event, which was held at the Shangri-La Hotel. The annual event was organised by the Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore and the Lianhe Wanbao daily. Mr Tharman also urged leaders of small businesses to focus more on developing the labour force. ""That is our most important objective - to enable everyone to discover their potential and feel fulfilled. It is only by developing our people in each enterprise that we can get get real value from our investments."" He also singled out a few of the winners of this year's awards for their innovative approaches to traditional businesses. Mr Tharman cited incense and candle company Lijay Tradings, which was named the most innovative firm after growing its sales by creating fruit-shaped incense products to attract younger customers. Herbal hair treatment firm Bee Choo Origin was also lauded by Mr Tharman as an ""old economy"" business that has gone global. ""Madam Cheah Bee Chew started the business 15 years ago at home in Pasir Ris, with one steamer,"" said Mr Tharman. The firm now has six outlets and sells hair products in 10 countries after securing international certification to improve its management system. It also tapped on a government grant to fund a project to reduce customers' waiting times. The Government will help firms which genuinely want to innovate by stepping up ""targeted help"" for them, instead of using a ""broad-based"" approach, Mr Tharman said. But he also urged firms not to abuse initiatives, such as the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme, which are meant to help companies increase productivity through new technology and innovation. He said there was a ""surge"" in the formation of sole proprietorships and partnerships last year as many firms sought to take advantage of the PIC scheme, as well as cases of businesses sharing employees for the purpose of claiming PIC cash payouts.

737551,d9b2b5ad-7aca-4d7f-9dd2-12156f40297f,WE'RE COMING HOME TEXAS!!,Books On Fire Tours,"Title: Coming Home Texas  Author: Laura Harner Genre: M/M Romance Release Date: September 24, 2015 You know what they say—you can’t go home again—and Brandon Masters doesn’t want to. But when he gets a call that his father is down hard with a broken leg, he puts his thriving real estate business, his fiancé, and his life on hold and returns to his small town roots in Goldview, Texas, temporarily picking up the reins of the world he left behind. A dozen years gone should be long enough to erase the pain and humiliation he suffered when the town’s bad boy broke his naive teenaged heart. Twelve years ago, Joe Martinez was left standing in the dust, his heart in his hand and his future on the line when the blond-haired, blue-eyed boy from the right side of the tracks left town without a backward glance. Or so he thought. Since then, he’s rebuilt himself from the boots up, to earn the respect of the community his father shamed. When the now-Sheriff Martinez discovers Brandon has returned long enough to help his father recover, he realizes he’s been handed the perfect opportunity to get the answers he needs to move on—and maybe seek a little payback for pain and suffering. But businessman-Brandon has learned a thing or two about protecting his heart—and breaking down those walls may not be as easy as it appears. Irresistible force—meet immovable object. Chapter 1 - Coming Home Texas +Laura Harner  - Subject to change “Well, dammit all to hell and Goldview, Texas, anyway,” Brandon Masters whispered under his breath. Not that there was anyone around to hear him, even if he’d shouted to the high heavens. He looked up and down the lonely stretch of highway. So close and yet so far, with nothing but his dead cell phone to keep him company. The way he saw the situation…he could suck it up and walk to town—or, he could wait around for the carrion feeders to discover his dried up, shriveled carcass at the side of the road. Ick.
Dead in a place he never thought he’d be visiting again voluntarily.
Other than forgetting his car charger, his other regret at the moment was driving his old pickup back to town instead of his BMW convertible. That had been a stupid, sentimental decision—Old Blue had taken his sorry ass out of town nearly a dozen years ago, and Brandon thought it fitting that she should bring him back. Of course his new Beamer came with roadside assistance, so he’d let his auto club membership expire. That worked out well. Not.
Since he’d gotten the call from Isabella—the closest thing to a mother that he’d known since his own mom died when he was nine—Brandon seemed to be stuck on a never ending sentimental highway. Once he decided he needed to come back, the memories he thought he buried long ago wouldn’t leave him alone.
Thoughts of Joe Martinez won’t leave me alone.
Reliving the humiliation of the night he left didn’t help. Neither did reminding himself that Joe and Sara Lynn had done him a favor.
If he had stayed around Goldview, he’d probably be selling used cars, maybe living in a trailer somewhere. Or stuck living at home on his dad’s ranch. Or dead because he’d been stupid enough to give himself to Joe that summer by the lake, and condoms hadn’t been on their list of priorities in the heat of the moment. Given what he’d learned about Joe later, Brandon had been damned lucky he hadn’t caught anything.
Nowadays, Brandon was thankful for his quiet life in San Diego. He had a successful career and a business, a nice house, and could afford the toys he wanted, like his Beamer and his sailboat. He didn’t have to depend on anyone else for his happiness—and he liked it that way.
Well, there was Ellis, but he tried not to depend on his fiancé, even though they were business partners, too. He’d learned the hard way, depending on other people meant letting down his guard to heartache and disappointment. Brandon hadn’t been disappointed in more than a decade…not since he’d left Goldview.
With a frustrated sigh, Brandon reached behind the seat, opened his toolbox, and pulled out a wrench. He kicked at the dust on the side of the road as he walked to the front and lifted the hood. Hot steam billowed out to dampen his hair, and he swiped his brow. Between the steam and the sun, he felt like he was in hell. He’d forgotten how hot it could be in Texas.
Once the steam cleared, he climbed on the bumper to lean underneath and took a good look. Well, damn…a hose had busted. With the sun baking his back, Brandon twisted and tried to get leverage on the nut of the hose clamp. Shifting his boots on the bumper, he grunted and pushed down on the wrench, but it slipped and he rapped his knuckles. He stopped to breathe a second, getting a nose full of the scent of burnt oil.
It was on him to fix this, he thought, as he leaned back in for another try. Out here in the boonies, help wasn’t likely to come anytime soon. Once he got the busted hose off, the walk back to town for a replacement was five miles. The walk to his dad’s ranch was just about the same distance. Before he got to either location, he’d probably fry like an egg. If he was going to help his dad, he needed to help himself first.
With a growl of determination, Brandon leaned a little deeper into the engine compartment, aligned the wrench again and grunted as he twisted. It budged a little and gave him hope that maybe he could get the darned thing off.
Brandon didn’t want to be in Goldview, Texas. But if Isabella hadn’t waited so damned long to call about his dad’s accident, he could have been here—and possibly gone—sooner. Of course, the old man probably forbade their longtime housekeeper from calling. Carl Masters needed to know that a broken hip and femur weren’t anything to mess around with, and neither was a green horse. Brandon planned on telling him that when he got to the Vida Nueva Ranch.
If he got there, he corrected, as he twisted the wrench again.
No luck. The damned thing was frozen in place by rust.
One thing he wasn’t going to do when he got to the ranch was take over the reins and run the place forever. He could help for a bit while his dad was down, but then he was getting the hell back to San Diego where he belonged. Years ago, he’d shot his dad down when he’d tried to talk Brandon into coming home permanently so he could take over someday—when Carl retired. Brandon had been clear then and he hadn’t changed his mind. Even as much as he missed seeing his family on a daily basis, his life was in San Diego now.
Carl’s accident did drive home a point, though. It was time for his dad to retire. That meant selling the ranch, and having Carl move in with him and Ellis in San Diego. Which Brandon probably should mention to his fiancé before he gave the news to his dad. Well, it was going to take a lot of convincing, anyway. Carl Masters had been riding since before he could walk—but it was time to get out of the saddle when a horse could throw a man like that.
When they’d talked at Christmastime, he’d basically told his dad it was getting close to the time to retire, but Carl was as stubborn as the old mule they’d had when Brandon was a kid. He’d said the only way he was leaving the ranch was feet first, and even then he wasn’t leaving, just waiting to be buried. That meant Carl would balk at the idea of coming to California for rehab. Which might mean Brandon was here for the duration. Because until Carl got back on his feet, Brandon was going to be helping Hep run the ranch.
If there could be a bright side, maybe this accident would teach Carl a lesson and knock some common sense into that hard head—this could be the perfect time to try to get him to at least agree to hang up his spurs and sell the ranch—maybe move to a smaller place in Goldview instead out here in the boonies.
Brandon shook his head as if to clear out the dust. Putting all his weight behind the wrench, he gave it one more forceful twist. The rusty clamp broke, and a burst of hot steam hit him solidly in the face. Brandon jerked back, whacked his head on the hood and cursed. He dropped the wrench, his boot heel slipped on the bumper, and he started waving his arms to regain his balance, even as he felt himself falling backward into empty air.
****
Given the demands of his job, Joe didn’t really have the time, but he needed to check on Carl Masters. The old man had an accident nearly a month ago, and had been in the hospital—but now he was home and laid up and it was the neighborly thing to do. Carl didn’t have much help at the ranch, and his only child was in San Diego. The only permanent help to run the place was Hep, his ranch manager, who was as old as Carl and twice as stubborn—which said a helluva lot.
They had a few hands at the Vida Nueva, but not nearly enough for the amount of cattle they were running these days. Joe never could figure out why Carl still insisted on keeping the ranch running at near capacity. As far as he knew, Carl wasn’t hurting for money. If he was planning to create a legacy for his son, he was wasting his time. The old man had to realize that Brandon wasn’t coming back.
Not after eleven years, ten months and two days. Joe knew because he would never forget the day Brandon left without so much as a goodbye.
Joe put his foot on the accelerator to speed down Wayfair to Big Sandy Bend Road. The faster he got to the Vida Nueva, the sooner he could get back to town—he was behind on things at the station, too. Halfway down the road, a twenty-year-old pickup with a fresh steel blue paint job caught his attention—the model so much like Brandon’s old truck it was almost like a slap in the face. Joe slowed as he got closer and looked inside the cab for the driver. The hood was up, which usually signaled car trouble, but he didn’t see anyone. He eased back on the gas, and checked in his rearview as he passed by, thinking he’d probably have to stop on his way back if the truck was still there.
When a pair of illegally long legs in skintight designer jeans appeared in the rearview mirror, Joe jerked the wheel to the right and looked again. Someone was bent under the hood of the old truck—nothing but legs and ass on display to the world as she appeared to be struggling with something under the hood. Joe made a quick U-turn and pulled in front of the truck.
Just as he exited the police SUV, steam billowed from under the truck’s hood and the woman reared back and hit her head on the hood with a thunk. Her well-worn boots skidded on the bumper, and Joe took off running. Shoulder-length blond hair swirling and arms flailing as she went backward, Joe dove forward and caught her back against his chest. He teetered for half a breath before momentum and gravity combined forces to knock him flat on his ass, the squirming motorist in his arms. Oh shit—not a woman.
Joe immediately knew why that truck on this road was familiar. His pulse thumped in his throat as the still-so-familiar body pressed against his. Joe pushed himself backward to clamber out from underneath the unwelcome shock, rose to his full height, squinting through his dark glasses as if this might be some kind of heat-induced hallucination.
Still looking down as he dusted off his clothes, Brandon hadn’t realized what happened. “Thanks, I owe you—”
“Brandon Masters,” Joe said.
The other man’s head jerked up, and for a moment, Brandon looked as shocked as Joe felt, but he recovered quicker. His mouth quirked up in a smug smile as he brazenly raked him with those indigo blue eyes. “Well, well, Joe Martinez. The last person I wanted to see my first day back in town.” He looked him over once more then said, “Huh. Nice uniform.” With a roll of his eyes, he turned back to his truck, climbed up on the bumper again then leaned under the hood.
In those rhinestone studded jeans and skin-tight blue silk shirt, Brandon Masters was dressed more for a nightclub than a dirt road in the middle of Bumfuck, Texas. He was sweaty, dirty, and grease-streaked—and still sexy as hell. Good enough to eat. Even better than he had looked at eighteen when he left town. Joe shifted his stance as his khaki pants got a little tighter. It seemed this particular man would always have that effect on him, and it irritated the hell out of him.
Even the grunts he made as he struggled under the hood were sexy. After a minute, Brandon jumped down off the bumper, holding the hose up like a prize. His wide smile didn’t help the situation. Joe let his gaze take a journey down his slim, sweat-slick throat, across surprisingly defined chest, then down to his narrow hips and the long legs before he stopped at the scuffed up cowboy boots. He took his time on the visual field trip until he met the cool blue eyes and he swallowed hard.
“I thought you were a woman.” Joe’s voice came out an accusation.
Something Joe couldn’t identify sparked in Brandon’s eyes. Hatred? Regret? He couldn’t tell. “You wish, asshole,” he clipped.
Brandon spun on his heel and stomped to the cab of the truck, his hips swinging in a way that made all the spit in Joe’s mouth dry up. Reaching inside, Brandon jerked out a large backpack and slung it over his shoulder. Without another glance at Joe, he headed up the road toward Goldview, his hips swinging, taunting Joe, with each long, loose stride. I live on waterfront property in Arizona because I've always wanted to be an oxymoron. I once enjoyed hobbies such as gardening and travel--now the characters my head compel me to tell their stories, so I write. (It doesn't actually help quiet the voices--but it keeps the folks in the white jackets at bay.) I love to tell stories of people who find themselves in unusual situations (attracted to a best friend, in a haunted house, kidnapped for his own good, etc.) and then have to find way to push through whatever it is holding them back from finding love. I'm a big believer that love comes in many flavors, so among my titles you'll find MF, MM, and multiple partners of various combinations. In other words, love outside the lines. Suspense included, no extra charge. My home is filled with an ever-revolving cast of characters--some of whom are actually real--and outside of writing and watching my Diamondbacks baseball, I am building my own version of the Willow Springs Ranch to turn into a writer's retreat. With over fifty published novels and novellas, I'm rapidly approaching a half million books sold! I want to thank each and every reader who's taken a chance on one of my books--that makes you family.

Her well-worn boots skidded on the bumper, and Joe took off running. Shoulder-length blond hair swirling and arms flailing as she went backward, Joe dove forward and caught her back against his chest. He teetered for half a breath before momentum and gravity combined forces to knock him flat on his ass, the squirming motorist in his arms. Oh shit—not a woman. Joe immediately knew why that truck on this road was familiar. His pulse thumped in his throat as the still-so-familiar body pressed against his. Joe pushed himself backward to clamber out from underneath the unwelcome shock, rose to his full height, squinting through his dark glasses as if this might be some kind of heat-induced hallucination. Still looking down as he dusted off his clothes, Brandon hadn’t realized what happened. “Thanks, I owe you—” “Brandon Masters,” Joe said. The other man’s head jerked up, and for a moment, Brandon looked as shocked as Joe felt, but he recovered quicker. His mouth quirked up in a smug smile as he brazenly raked him with those indigo blue eyes. “Well, well, Joe Martinez. The last person I wanted to see my first day back in town.” He looked him over once more then said, “Huh. Nice uniform.” With a roll of his eyes, he turned back to his truck, climbed up on the bumper again then leaned under the hood. In those rhinestone studded jeans and skin-tight blue silk shirt, Brandon Masters was dressed more for a nightclub than a dirt road in the middle of Bumfuck, Texas. He was sweaty, dirty, and grease-streaked—and still sexy as hell. Good enough to eat. Even better than he had looked at eighteen when he left town. Joe shifted his stance as his khaki pants got a little tighter. It seemed this particular man would always have that effect on him, and it irritated the hell out of him. Even the grunts he made as he struggled under the hood were sexy. After a minute, Brandon jumped down off the bumper, holding the hose up like a prize. His wide smile didn’t help the situation. Joe let his gaze take a journey down his slim, sweat-slick throat, across surprisingly defined chest, then down to his narrow hips and the long legs before he stopped at the scuffed up cowboy boots. He took his time on the visual field trip until he met the cool blue eyes and he swallowed hard. “I thought you were a woman.” Joe’s voice came out an accusation. Something Joe couldn’t identify sparked in Brandon’s eyes. Hatred? Regret? He couldn’t tell. “You wish, asshole,” he clipped. Brandon spun on his heel and stomped to the cab of the truck, his hips swinging in a way that made all the spit in Joe’s mouth dry up. Reaching inside, Brandon jerked out a large backpack and slung it over his shoulder. Without another glance at Joe, he headed up the road toward Goldview, his hips swinging, taunting Joe, with each long, loose stride. I live on waterfront property in Arizona because I've always wanted to be an oxymoron. I once enjoyed hobbies such as gardening and travel--now the characters my head compel me to tell their stories, so I write. (It doesn't actually help quiet the voices--but it keeps the folks in the white jackets at bay.) I love to tell stories of people who find themselves in unusual situations (attracted to a best friend, in a haunted house, kidnapped for his own good, etc.) and then have to find way to push through whatever it is holding them back from finding love. I'm a big believer that love comes in many flavors, so among my titles you'll find MF, MM, and multiple partners of various combinations. In other words, love outside the lines. Suspense included, no extra charge. My home is filled with an ever-revolving cast of characters--some of whom are actually real--and outside of writing and watching my Diamondbacks baseball, I am building my own version of the Willow Springs Ranch to turn into a writer's retreat. With over fifty published novels and novellas, I'm rapidly approaching a half million books sold! I want to thank each and every reader who's taken a chance on one of my books--that makes you family.

John Kasich in the midst of another packed week of presidential politics, the Republican's White House campaign has dispatched Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor to Idaho for a big Republican event. 
 
Taylor will attend Wednesday evening's  Ada County Republican Round-Up as a Kasich surrogate, said campaign spokesman Chris Schrimpf. 
 
The event, a fundraiser for the local GOP, will be at Idaho Gov. Butch Otter's ranch. It will be Taylor's first time stumping for Kasich at the national level. 
 
Kasich for America is paying for Taylor's travel costs. 
 
Taylor tweeted about her travels earlier Wednesday.

Kasich has been in New York this week, meeting with potential donors and  taping an appearance for NBC's ""Late Night with Seth Meyers."" He has other campaign events planned later this week in South Carolina and Iowa, two key early states on the Republican primary and caucus calendar. 
 
But Kasich's political operation, eager to collect delegates where it can in a crowded GOP race, also has shown an interest in making inroads in smaller states. On Wednesday, for example, he announced a leadership team in Massachusetts. The team includes Peter Torkildsen, a former congressman and state party chairman. 
 
The lieutenant governor's trip coincides with an Idaho endorsement for Kasich. His campaign announced that State Sen. Marv Hagedorn will serve as a co-chair there. 
 
""As a small businessman and veteran I appreciate Gov. Kasich's work to balance our nation's budget and create a strong national defense,"" Hagedorn said.

Tech fans have been left devastated after Apple's new iOS 9 operating system was released without a new range of emojis.  
 
Angry Apple lovers have taken to Twitter to vent their fury at the ""missing emojis"", which include a controversial middle finger icon.  
 
These new emotional icons were widely expected to be made available yesterday, when iOS 9 was released for download. 
 
But they will actually come with the next version of Apple's mobile operating system, which is not released until later this year. 
 
On Twitter, Apple fans raged about the lack of emojis, particularly one which would allow them to make a very rude gesture indeed.

Other emojis include a cheese wedge, burrito, hot dog and a popping champagne bottle.

 Microsoft's famously office-orientated operating system beat Apple by allowing its users to employ the controversial icon.

In total, nearly £2.5 billion of payments were made to savers in the first three months after the new pension rules for over-55s were introduced, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said. The sum equates to £27 million of payments being made a day. 
 
The figures, covering April, May and June, show that within the overall payouts figure, around £1.3 billion was paid out in cash lump sums, with an average payment size of just under £15,000. 
 
And around £1.1 billion was paid out via 264,000 income drawdown payments, with the average payment being nearly £4,200. 
 
Income drawdown is where someone  leaves their pension pot invested but takes an income directly from it. 
 
The pension freedoms, introduced on April 6, mean that instead of being required to buy an annuity with their pension pot, people aged 55 and over have more flexibility to take their pots how they wish. Generally, 25% of the pot is tax-free and the remainder is subject to tax. 
 
The ABI's figures also show that £2.3 billion was invested by savers into buying around 37,500 products which will give them a regular income in the three months since the new freedoms were launched. 
 
Within this total figure, £1.3 billion has been invested into 19,600 income drawdown products, with an average fund size of almost £68,000. Some £990 million was also invested into around 17,800 annuities, with the average fund invested being just over £55,600. 
 
Nearly half (45%) of customers buying an annuity changed their provider, the ABI said. Pensions experts have raised concerns in recent years that not enough people have been shopping around to get the best annuity deal for their needs.

214407,e7ebb485-2036-461a-b52c-721cdd502ca2,Is Mitch McConnell next?,Classic Hits 99.3 The Eagle,"(CNN) – Conservatives at the Values Voter Summit cheered Friday morning when they learned that House Speaker John Boehner was retiring. Friday afternoon, they cheered again when someone suggested the next establishment Republican to lose his job should be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. 

“Here’s what I say to in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down. Mitch McConnell, it is now your turn,” Louisiana Gov. and GOP presidential candidate Bobby Jindal said to raucous applause. 

After the news of Boehner’s resignation, Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon told reporters he had texted his fellow conservative friend, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, with the simple message: “the next guy in the crosshairs is probably McConnell.” 

The Kentucky Republican has never been the favorite of tea party-aligned conservatives. His budget deals with the Obama administration — most notably the December 2012 agreement with Vice President Joe Biden averting the so-called fiscal cliff — haven’t endeared him to the base who say he gives up too much. He has declined to get rid of the Senate filibuster in order to block the Iran nuclear deal, and critics say he surrendered the fight over federal funding for Planned Parenthood by declaring early on that he would actively seek to avoid a government shutdown. 

But McConnell likely isn’t going anywhere. While talk radio may call for his head, there are no signs of a true in-house groundswell against him. Making things more difficult for a would-be insurgent, the Senate leader is elected only by his or her conference, meaning it would be harder to get the critical mass needed to unseat him. 

That doesn’t mean conservatives will be silent — McConnell epitomizes the Republican establishment in Washington that several of the top GOP presidential candidates such as Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are running against. 

Seventy-two percent of Republican primary voters said they are dissatisfied with the ability of Boehner and McConnell to achieve their party’s goals, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. And 36 percent wanted them immediately removed from their leadership positions. 

Jindal’s other big applause line at the Values Voter Summit regarding Boehner: “That’s one down, that’s 434 more to go.” 

McConnell’s office declined to comment, but referred CNN to the second-ranking Senate Republican, John Cornyn. “As someone who’s in constant contact with our members, it’s clear Leader McConnell has overwhelming support within the conference,” Cornyn said. 

Rep. Bill Flores, R-Texas, said many House GOP members were frustrated with Senate Republicans for not pushing a more conservative agenda and taking up bills the House passed. 

“In my view the Speaker fell on his sword for all of Congress, and I hope the Senate starts to get things done.” 

To reporters, Salmon aimed his frustration at the filibuster and the 60-vote threshold that Democrats have used to block House GOP initiatives. 

“A lot of the problem that we’re engaged in is because the Senate doesn’t take any action on anything,” Salmon said. “And there is nothing that any presidential candidate on our side says that will ever be realized as long as the modern day filibuster is enacted the way it is today.” 

McConnell has been tested before from the right. He defeated Tea Party challenger Matt Bevin in a contentious 2014 Republican Kentucky Senate primary. And in July, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tore into McConnell in a rare personal attack on the Senate floor, accusing the majority leader of lying. Cruz said McConnell had promised he had not cut a deal to allow a vote on the Export-Import Bank, an institution Cruz believes is corrupt. 

“If he was telling us the truth that there was no deal, why would he do what he just did?” Cruz asked. “We now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.” 

Cruz’s attacks, however, may only have served to remind conservatives about how powerful McConnell is. Several influential Republican senators chastised Cruz after the incident. 

Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, warned Cruz that the type of rhetoric that works outside Washington doesn’t work on the Hill. 

“Squabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other venues — or perhaps on the campaign trail,” Hatch said, “but they have no place among colleagues in the United States Senate.”",721,"simple message: “the next guy in the crosshairs is probably McConnell.” The Kentucky Republican has never been the favorite of tea party-aligned conservatives.

TUCSON, Ariz. - A Border Patrol agent has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of a Mexican teenager who was shot from the U.S. side of the border in 2012. 

Lonnie Swartz was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury that reviewed the death of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez, who was shot about 10 times. 

The Border Patrol has said that Elena Rodriguez was among a group of rock throwers endangering agents' lives. His family insists the boy was walking home from a basketball game with friends and was not armed or hurling rocks. 

Luis Parra, the attorney for the boy's mother, said the family was grateful to the Department of Justice ""for this first step in the pursuit of justice,"" and they ""remain steadfast in their resolve to seek full transparency"" from the Border Patrol. 

Swartz's attorney, Sean Chapman, did not respond to a call seeking comment. He told The Arizona Daily Star that he expects his client to plead not guilty at an Oct. 9 arraignment. The U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to a request for comment. 

Swartz also faces a federal civil rights lawsuit in the death of the teen, who was in Nogales, Sonora, on Oct. 10, 2012, when Swartz fired from Nogales, Arizona. 

The case happened amid criticism that the Border Patrol uses force indiscriminately, a charge the agency has denied. Border Patrol agents are generally allowed to use lethal force against rock throwers because rocks can be deadly. Rock throwers have attacked agents more than 1,700 times since 2010, according to the agency. 

Chapman tried to get the family's lawsuit thrown out on the grounds that the Constitution does not apply to the boy, a Mexican citizen, because he was in Mexico at the time of the shooting. 

A federal judge in July ruled that the lawsuit can go forward. 

In a similar case in Texas, a federal appeals court ruled that a teen killed in Mexico by a border agent in El Paso, Texas, was not protected by the Constitution. 

Border Patrol agent Jesus Mesa Jr. shot 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca in 2010 near a bridge between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua. 

Authorities said Mesa was trying to arrest immigrants who had illegally crossed into the country when rock throwers attacked him. Mesa fired his weapon across the Rio Grande, striking the teen twice. 

A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals originally said Hernandez Guereca's family could sue Mesa. But the full court overturned that ruling in April.

104770,1f7947d4-8a9f-446c-82e7-6fade0352d90,Greek party ads spice up election campaign,Yahoo!Xtra,"Athens (AFP) - Alexis Tsipras is a six-year-old with a broken left arm and Greece's leading female politician changes a tyre in high heels while refusing to pay the country's debt -- party ads are spicing up an otherwise flat election campaign. 

It is a neck-and-neck race between the mainstream leftists and conservatives ahead of Sunday's election cliffhanger -- but at the other end of the chart, smaller parties desperate to keep a foot in parliament are pulling out all the stops to soak up votes. 

The group of anti-austerity leftists who toppled Prime Minister Tsipras last month, Popular Unity, may be seen as outdated euro-haters but are earning top marks at sendup as the country slogs through its fifth snap election in six years. 

Their leader, Panagiotis Lafazanis, pokes fun at himself in a cab while debunking rumours he plotted to seize the country's euro reserves, while sharp-tongued Zoe Constantopoulou, the pugnacious former parliament speaker sharply opposed to Tsipras and his economic reforms, shows she has what it takes by deftly changing the tyre. 

- 'Nothing to lose' - 

""It's communication guerrilla tactics,"" says Paschos Mandravelis, a columnist at the liberal Kathimerini daily newspaper. 

""The small parties have no views to highlight, nothing to lose, and on top of that it's fashionable,"" he says. 

Tsipras himself seems to be all over the airwaves. 

In his party's own commercial, he is the leader of Greece's future promising to rid the country of decades of mismanagement and party nepotism. 

""We're done with the old and we'll win the future,"" he says. 

But in Poland, where he features in the campaign for elections in October, he can be seen in a commercial by the ruling centrist Civic Platform party that warns voters about Greece's economic pitfalls. 

Back at home, his erstwhile -- and possibly future -- coalition allies, the Independent Greeks, seem to believe 41-year-old Tsipras, Greece's youngest premier in 150 years, will forever be a boy. 

In a scene-stealing commercial from the January election campaign that brought Tsipras and his Syriza party to power, Independent Greeks party leader Panos Kammenos mentors the future PM in the form of a young boy called Alexis over a toy train. 

Now there is a sequel. 

This time round, little Alexis has broken his left arm -- a reference to the anti-austerity revolt by Syriza hardliners in August that toppled his government and forced this week's ballot -- and right-wing Kammenos promises to teach him how to use his right hand instead. 

""My left hand is fine,"" Tsipras joked to reporters earlier this month, calling the commercial ""cute"". 

He has yet to comment on the TV appearance of his former comrade Lafazanis, who led the summer rebellion that split the Syriza party asunder. 

In July, anti-euro Lafazanis -- then a senior Syriza cadre -- was rumoured to have advocated a takeover of the Greek national mint, the Nomismatokopeio, to seize euro reserves, thus enabling Greece to survive a standoff with the European Central Bank that had shuttered Greek banks. 

Lafazanis has strongly denied this, but in his party's tongue-in-cheek ad, he boards a taxi and tells the driver to take him to the national mint. 

When the startled driver turns to face him, Lafazanis gives him a smirk. 

He then tells prospective Popular Unity voters: ""We have an anti-austerity solution. Learn about it."" 

It is also his party that features tough-talking high-heeled former parliament speaker Constantopoulou, who believes most of Greece's huge national debt is illegal and the country should not pay it back. 

Towering matriarch-style over a male Mini Cooper driver seated in the dirt reading a parliament report on the national debt, she lectures him on economics -- and throws him a spare tyre. 

- Back into coma - 

Centrist To Potami party shows a man waking up in hospital after a six-year coma, having missed the country's three bailouts, five governments and the economic crisis. 

Learning his family store has shut down and he can no longer get a pension, he asks to go back into coma. 

""Wake me up in four years, if something goes well,"" he says. 

In contrast, Greece's main conservative party, New Democracy, has mainstream TV spots portraying Tsipras' administration as gamblers and economy amateurs whose experiments plunged the country deeper into crisis. 

New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis has accused Tsipras of wasting months in fractious talks with EU-IMF creditors, imposing capital controls and nearly taking the country out of the eurozone. 

""No more experiments -- Greece needs stability,"" the ad says. 

The latest polls have shown Syriza and New Democracy in a tight race for first place. 

""Small parties have nothing to lose,"" says Manolis Alexakis, a professor of sociology at the University of Crete. ""Humour is a delicate business, and the main parties don't want to risk a costly mistake.""",804,"may be seen as outdated euro-haters but are earning top marks at sendup as the country slogs through its fifth snap election in six years. Their leader, Panagiotis Lafazanis, pokes fun at himself in a cab while debunking rumours he plotted to seize the country's euro reserves, while sharp-tongued Zoe Constantopoulou, the pugnacious former parliament speaker sharply opposed to Tsipras and his economic reforms, shows she has what it takes by deftly changing the tyre. - 'Nothing to lose' - ""It's communication guerrilla tactics,"" says Paschos Mandravelis, a columnist at the liberal Kathimerini daily newspaper. ""The small parties have no views to highlight, nothing to lose, and on top of that it's fashionable,"" he says. Tsipras himself seems to be all over the airwaves. In his party's own commercial, he is the leader of Greece's future promising to rid the country of decades of mismanagement and party nepotism. ""We're done with the old and we'll win the future,"" he says. But in Poland, where he features in the campaign for elections in October, he can be seen in a commercial by the ruling centrist Civic Platform party that warns voters about Greece's economic pitfalls. Back at home, his erstwhile -- and possibly future -- coalition allies, the Independent Greeks, seem to believe 41-year-old Tsipras, Greece's youngest premier in 150 years, will forever be a boy. In a scene-stealing commercial from the January election campaign that brought Tsipras and his Syriza party to power, Independent Greeks party leader Panos Kammenos mentors the future PM in the form of a young boy called Alexis over a toy train. Now there is a sequel. This time round, little Alexis has broken his left arm -- a reference to the anti-austerity revolt by Syriza hardliners in August that toppled his government and forced this week's ballot -- and right-wing Kammenos promises to teach him how to use his right hand instead. ""My left hand is fine,"" Tsipras joked to reporters earlier this month, calling the commercial ""cute"". He has yet to comment on the TV appearance of his former comrade Lafazanis, who led the summer rebellion that split the Syriza party asunder. In July, anti-euro Lafazanis -- then a senior Syriza cadre -- was rumoured to have advocated a takeover of the Greek national mint, the Nomismatokopeio, to seize euro reserves, thus enabling Greece to survive a standoff with the European Central Bank that had shuttered Greek banks. Lafazanis has strongly denied this, but in his party's tongue-in-cheek ad, he boards a taxi and tells the driver to take him to the national mint. When the startled driver turns to face him, Lafazanis gives him a smirk. He then tells prospective Popular Unity voters: ""We have an anti-austerity solution. Learn about it."" It is also his party that features tough-talking high-heeled former parliament speaker Constantopoulou, who believes most of Greece's huge national debt is illegal and the country should not pay it back. Towering matriarch-style over a male Mini Cooper driver seated in the dirt reading a parliament report on the national debt, she lectures him on economics -- and throws him a spare tyre. - Back into coma - Centrist To Potami party shows a man waking up in hospital after a six-year coma, having missed the country's three bailouts, five governments and the economic crisis. Learning his family store has shut down and he can no longer get a pension, he asks to go back into coma. ""Wake me up in four years, if something goes well,"" he says. In contrast, Greece's main conservative party, New Democracy, has mainstream TV spots portraying Tsipras' administration as gamblers and economy amateurs whose experiments plunged the country deeper into crisis. New Democracy leader Vangelis Meimarakis has accused Tsipras of wasting months in fractious talks with EU-IMF creditors, imposing capital controls and nearly taking the country out of the eurozone. ""No more experiments -- Greece needs stability,"" the ad says. The latest polls have shown Syriza and New Democracy in a tight race for first place.

663466,1148a165-9e1f-4252-80ce-870cfca170ad,Anni Dewani death: coroner questions need for UK inquest,UK news | The Guardian,"A coroner has questioned whether there should be an inquest in the UK into the death of businessman Shrien Dewani’s wife, Anni, during a carjacking in South Africa. Dewani was cleared last year of orchestrating the killing of his new bride, Anni Dewani, 28, who was fatally shot as the couple drove through the outskirts of Cape Town on 14 November 2010. Her father, Vinod Hindocha, 66, and uncle, Ashok Hindocha, 55, appeared at north London coroner’s court on Wednesday to argue that Dewani should attend an inquest and answer their questions. But coroner Andrew Walker told the family that Dewani had a right not to answer questions that may incriminate himself and raised doubts over whether an inquest would take place. Walker said: “My view, members of the family, is that in these circumstances it would serve no purpose to hold an inquest because I would not be able to answer the questions that an inquest sets out to answer. I’m going to direct that your questions are sent to Mr Dewani – and Mr Dewani is to indicate whether he would be prepared to answer those questions.” Dewani, 34, was extradited to South Africa last year but the case collapsed after a judge found that it was “riddled with inconsistencies”. It meant he walked free before having to give evidence and has never spoken publicly about what happened. In a statement read out to the court as the trial began, Dewani described himself as bisexual and admitted he had slept with male prostitutes. A key witness for the prosecution was a male escort who went by the name The German Master, but his evidence was ruled inadmissible. Three men – Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni – were given jail terms for their role in the killing. They claimed Dewani arranged a hijacking-gone-wrong in which he would survive while his wife was killed. Ashok Hindocha told the hearing that there were discrepancies between what Dewani had told the family, the press and the South African police, and asked for a “chance to hear the right story from him”. Asked why the family wanted an inquest to go ahead, he said: “The main reason is that we would like to know what really happened. The motive of this case was never properly heard in South Africa. “Members of Scotland Yard and other witnesses never got a chance to speak because the judge thought it was not important - if he [Dewani] is gay or bisexual, she didn’t want to know about that. So there is an issue about the motive.” The inquest into Anni Dewani’s death opened in 2010 but was suspended pending the criminal investigation. Walker said that another hearing would be held on 9 October.",459,"Dewani had a right not to answer questions that may incriminate himself and raised doubts over whether an inquest would take place.

Not to worry, there’s nothing nefarious about it and it’s all in good fun to help an important cause. 

On Monday, Crombie helped kick-off Hunger Awareness Week at Celebration Square with the launch of her city-wide food drive challenge to support the Mississauga Food Bank. 

It’s billed as a friendly competition between residents of all the city’s wards to see which one can collect the most non-perishable food items. 

“We encourage residents to donate non-perishable goods to their local fire (stations),” said Crombie. “With Thanksgiving around the corner, these contributions will help ensure families can enjoy a warm cooked meal and share in new memories together during the holidays.” 

Residents are asked to drop off non-perishable food donations at their local fire stations. The ward that has collected the most food will be named the winner on Oct. 17. 

The goal of the drive is to collect 80,000 pounds of food and $80,000 by Oct. 16. 

“Our fire stations are well positioned throughout the city and provide easy drop off points in most neighbourhoods,” said Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services chief Tim Beckett. “We encourage everyone to reach into their cupboards and drop off much needed food to your local fire station.” 

The Mississauga Food Bank released its 2015 Face of Hunger report during the launch of the campaign that looked at Mississauga’s food bank users. The report found that 13,000 residents visit the food bank each month, that over 112,000 people in the city live below the poverty line and that the average age of a food bank user is 46. 

""Thanksgiving is a critical time for Mississauga to rally together to raise food and funds to feed our hungry neighbours,” said Chris Hatch, executive director of the Mississauga Food Bank. “We are so appreciative to Mayor Crombie for creating the city-wide food drive challenge and to Mississauga Fire and Emergency Services for partnering with us to make this campaign a success.” 

Food collection bins have also been set up at City Hall.

748136,18699b05-5b8b-4b6c-a02d-9fc9247b3181,Couple donates $10 million to UW-Madison,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,"A couple who worked their way through the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the 1970s is donating $10 million to their alma mater for need-based scholarships and endowed faculty positions in the schools of education and business to help future students get a similar education. 
 
""Tom Falk caddied his way into higher education. Karen Falk donned a white coat and worked behind the counter at Rennebohm's to help her pursue her degree. In the 1970s, when they attended UW-Madison, that was enough,"" the university said Tuesday. 
 
Tom Falk is a 32-year veteran at Kimberly-Clark, and has been CEO for more than a decade. He grew up in the Milwaukee area as the oldest of nine children. As a preteen, he became a caddie at Chenequa Country Club in Hartland — the only job a 12-year-old could get. 
 
The position made him eligible for an Evans Scholarship — a full-tuition award available only to caddies. Falk was named that club's first Evans Scholar, and the award opened the university's doors to him, he said. He earned a degree in accounting at the UW's business school in 1980. 
 
Karen Falk, a native of Hartland, lived at Zoe Bayliss Women's Cooperative, a low-cost housing option, to make ends meet. She graduated from the School of Education in 1980 and has taught and volunteered in public schools. 
 
The Falks' donation is a combination of an immediate, outright gift and a bequest to fund two areas where UW-Madison most urgently seeks support: need-based scholarships; and endowed faculty positions. 
 
Working one's way through a public university in four years with a minimum-wage summer job and part-time campus work study — with little to no family assistance or need-based financial aid — is an outdated ideal of previous generations. 
 
Students today are paying a much higher share of the cost than students 40 years ago, when a family could have sent three kids to UW-Madison for what it costs to send one kid today, adjusted for inflation, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis . 
 
Tuition at four-year UW campuses has steadily risen above the rate of inflation since 1987, while state support has lagged below inflation since 1980. The diverging curves reflect a national trend of a dramatic shift in who covers the majority of cost for a college education: students and their families, instead of taxpayers. 
 
In 1978, a UW-Madison student paying his or her own way, without any help, had to earn $2,362. It could be done at minimum wage by working full-time through the summer and about 10 hours a week through the academic year, or a total 891 hours, according to the newspaper's analysis. 
 
Today, a full-time UW-Madison student going it alone couldn't physically work enough hours at minimum wage to earn $20,419 for tuition, fees, room and board — not including miscellaneous expenses. It would take 2,816 hours, or about 55 hours per week for 52 weeks. 
 
""I believe that the best people are in every corner in society, and we want to make sure the best people in society have a chance to rise up,"" Tom Falk said in a statement. 
 
The couple's experiences inspired them to create the Karen A. Falk Diversity Scholarship Fund in Education, which will support students from underrepresented groups enrolled at the UW's School of Education, and the Thomas J. Falk Diversity Scholarship, offered through the Wisconsin School of Business. 
 
""It's really important for children to have role models who look like them or have similar backgrounds to them,"" Karen Falk said in the statement. ""We want to help take those fabulous students and make sure they can actually afford to complete an education."" 
 
The Falks will also endow two faculty chairs: the Karen A. Falk Distinguished Chair of Education and the Thomas J. Falk Distinguished Chair in Business. Both posts are intended to support the areas of study that the schools' leaders feel are most important. 
 
""We know education and business are going to change over a long period of time,"" Tom Falk said, ""and we hope these gifts will give flexibility to the university and the deans of the schools and colleges we were involved in to apply them where the emphasis needs to be."" 
 
The Falks have served on the board of visitors for the schools from which they graduated, and on July 1, Tom Falk began a term as chair of the UW Foundation's board of directors. 
 
The foundation raises, invests and distributes funds for the benefit of UW-Madison. 
 
""We are fortunate to have the support of Karen and Tom Falk,"" Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in a statement. ""They have shown incredible dedication to UW-Madison, and this gift will benefit many future Badgers in years to come.""",785,"a decade.

The Falks' donation is a combination of an immediate, outright gift and a bequest to fund two areas where UW-Madison most urgently seeks support: need-based scholarships; and endowed faculty positions. Working one's way through a public university in four years with a minimum-wage summer job and part-time campus work study — with little to no family assistance or need-based financial aid — is an outdated ideal of previous generations. Students today are paying a much higher share of the cost than students 40 years ago, when a family could have sent three kids to UW-Madison for what it costs to send one kid today, adjusted for inflation, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis . Tuition at four-year UW campuses has steadily risen above the rate of inflation since 1987, while state support has lagged below inflation since 1980. The diverging curves reflect a national trend of a dramatic shift in who covers the majority of cost for a college education: students and their families, instead of taxpayers. In 1978, a UW-Madison student paying his or her own way, without any help, had to earn $2,362. It could be done at minimum wage by working full-time through the summer and about 10 hours a week through the academic year, or a total 891 hours, according to the newspaper's analysis. Today, a full-time UW-Madison student going it alone couldn't physically work enough hours at minimum wage to earn $20,419 for tuition, fees, room and board — not including miscellaneous expenses. It would take 2,816 hours, or about 55 hours per week for 52 weeks. ""I believe that the best people are in every corner in society, and we want to make sure the best people in society have a chance to rise up,"" Tom Falk said in a statement. The couple's experiences inspired them to create the Karen A. Falk Diversity Scholarship Fund in Education, which will support students from underrepresented groups enrolled at the UW's School of Education, and the Thomas J. Falk Diversity Scholarship, offered through the Wisconsin School of Business. ""It's really important for children to have role models who look like them or have similar backgrounds to them,"" Karen Falk said in the statement. ""We want to help take those fabulous students and make sure they can actually afford to complete an education."" The Falks will also endow two faculty chairs: the Karen A. Falk Distinguished Chair of Education and the Thomas J. Falk Distinguished Chair in Business. Both posts are intended to support the areas of study that the schools' leaders feel are most important. ""We know education and business are going to change over a long period of time,"" Tom Falk said, ""and we hope these gifts will give flexibility to the university and the deans of the schools and colleges we were involved in to apply them where the emphasis needs to be."" The Falks have served on the board of visitors for the schools from which they graduated, and on July 1, Tom Falk began a term as chair of the UW Foundation's board of directors. The foundation raises, invests and distributes funds for the benefit of UW-Madison. ""We are fortunate to have the support of Karen and Tom Falk,"" Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in a statement. ""They have shown incredible dedication to UW-Madison, and this gift will benefit many future Badgers in years to come.""","A couple who worked their way through the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the 1970s is donating $10 million to their alma mater for need-based scholarships and endowed faculty positions in the schools of education and business to help future students get a similar education.

912981,d5d08a65-1197-4268-ad6e-c329bf742222,"More women in top public service jobs, but men still well on top",Melbourne Age,"Almost twice as many women as men are employed at the APS levels in the public service, but men continue to dominate the top jobs, with almost a third more male than female senior executives, according to the APS Statistical Bulletin 2013-14.

The data, which also tracks the number of public servants employed each year from 2000-2014, reveals the number of women filling graduate and APS level one to six positions has come a long way in the past 14 years.

About 16 per cent more women than men were employed in 2000 compared to the 40 per cent more women than men employed last year. 

In 2014, there were 98,088 women and 59,271 men working for Australian federal departments in this bracket.

Consequently, the percentage of women making up the Australian Public Service (APS) as a whole has grown substantially.

The APS was home to 145,891 public servants last year including 26.5 per cent more women (84,078) than men (61,813).

Of the 103,076 employed in 2000, slightly more public servants were male, with 51,604 men and 51,472 women.

Former high-ranking public servant, Emeritus Professor Meredith Edwards, said while the figures showed a forward trend, they didn't reveal the uneven proportions of women spread across Commonwealth departments.

""If you look at Treasury [and] Defence, you'll find there's a much, much higher proportion of men than women compared to, say, the Department of Social Services, Health [or] Education,"" she said.

Professor Edwards, from the University of Canberra's Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, said there was still unconscious bias in the public service, with only a handful of women heading Commonwealth departments.

""Although we've got a trend that's going forward, it's easy to go backwards,"" she said.

""There's a lot of unconscious bias. Merit, primarily, is not actually merit - there's a lot of cloning that goes on.""

Higher up the ranks, 33 per cent more men than women were employed at the senior executive level last year, with 1530 male senior executives compared to 1026 female senior executives. 

This data includes SES levels one to three. 

The divide was twice as large more than a decade ago with about two-thirds more men than women employed at the top levels in 2000, including just 390 women compared to 1161 men. 

Meanwhile, almost 10 per cent more men than women were employed at the executive levels in 2014, with 20,719 men at executive 1 and 2 level compared to 18,665.

.

Rewind to the year 2000 and there were twice as many men than women taking home an executive pay packet, including 13,054 men and 6339 women.

Last year's gender divide was much more even among graduate and trainee public servants with slightly more women forging their APS careers.

There were just 11 more women than men employed last year, with 769 female grads and trainees compared to 758 men. 

Fourteen years earlier there was a greater portion of women employed in these lower-level positions, with 732 female starters compared to 630 men, or 14 per cent more women.

Adjunct Professor Carmel McGregor, also from the institute, said the results demonstrated a clear improvement in the participation of women overall.

""This gives hope for young women in particular to be able to see a pathway they can pursue for a career in the APS,"" she said. 

""Having a number of role models in the senior ranks will give hope to those starting out. Now we just need to see this realised in an increase in the number of women secretaries.""",588,"women than men employed last year.

In order to successfully sell an idea first you need to get the client’s attention Then you need to get himher interested in the idea and get himher to desire the productservice Next convince himher yours is the best Finally inspire action by making himher make a commitment – pledge or sign up I’ll expatiate 

Pre-approach 
Establish a rapport If you will be giving a presentation before even showing up make sure you are dressed appropriately Being formally dressed gives you an air of professionalism You can start with some humor by opening with an appropriate joke If you’re not good with jokes give the individual compliments on their company products or services Proceed by formally introducing yourself and what you plan to achieve 

If you will be writing start by eloquently introducing yourself your productsservices and briefly mention any applicable business accoladesportfolio if any You can also express your admiration for the company by stating how you learnt about the company and how much about their business you actually know From there you can proceed to state what you plan to achieve Most often than not you will be selling yourself as well as your business so get them to like you first 

Attention 
Get attention The only way you will get their full attention is by addressing their challengesroot problems When you can successfully convey an understanding of a presentrecurring problem you will get the individual interested and get their undivided attention 

Recognize 
Recognize and empathize This is the point you establish a need You must be frankhonest and give statistics if you can Communicating knowledge of what would be the perfect solution to the challengesproblems is likely to build a strong desire for your productsservices 

Tackle 
Tackle resistance and create satisfaction This is the point your pitchproposal comes in as you will explainillustrate how your productsservices will solve their issues This is also the point where you answer questions You will be asked questions like “What makes your productsservices unique” and “Why isare your productsservices the best or better option” To successfully answer these kinds of questions remember FAB – Features Advantages and Benefits At this point of the presentationproposal you need to list the features of your productsservices Next you list your strengths – your edgesuperiority and highlight the advantages you have over your competition Finally list the benefits your client stands to gain by choosing you Showcasing all those is bound to convince the client of the value of your productsservices 

Yes-Building 
Motivate action Close your presentationproposal by motivating action You don’t want to be aggressive in your closing Remember the higher the costprice of an item the more the commitment from the client hence there might be some hesitation If you manage to make yourself likeable via your dressing opening jokes or simply your professionalism then the battle is half-won 

There are two effective methods of closing the time-driven close and the trial close The time-driven close is offering the client a significant discount on the productservice contingent on the client purchasing that product or signing up for that service within a clearly defined time frame For example offering the client a discountfree service by signing uppaying at the time of the presentation or from the day of presentation until the following week It works because everyone loves discounts and freebies 

The trial close is offering the client a free trial of the productservice for a limited period of time for testing For example giving the client a grill for a barbeque on Sunday to be returned on Monday It works because satisfied clients would typically rather pay than return because they got to test it and hopefully enjoyed it 

This is how to make a good sale 

I believe a business proposal is a sales device through it you plan to sell an idea product or service to the recipient If you are successful and they buy into you andor your proposal remember to stay in contact with them Try to establish and foster a 1-1 relationship with your clients Customer service is a huge part of business so make sure you have an excellent customer service plan in place Don’t forget – it is easier to maintain old customers than get new ones

917017,34046f5e-6e3a-40d7-bf11-ad64f05973fe,Metro North Schedule Changes Starting Oct 3 & 4,Transit Blogger,"The Metro-North Railroad has announced schedule changes that will start on October 3rd & 4th. Here are the details via official press release: 
 
New timetables are coming to Metro-North’s New Haven Line and Harlem Line on Sunday, October 4, and to the Hudson Line on Saturday, October 3. On the New Haven Line, Metro-North is creating a better morning rush hour connection to Greenwich for Shore Line East customers. On the Hudson Line, weekend track work will mean special timetables for seven weekends. Customers on all three lines should look for other, minor scheduling changes. 
 
New Haven Line 
 
Metro-North is making it easier for Shore Line East commuters to reach Greenwich. Commuters who ride Shore Line East’s 5:50 a.m. departure from New London, Conn., making all stops to West Haven, then Bridgeport, then arriving at Stamford at 8:03 a.m., will now be able to change at Stamford for an 8:14 a.m. train to Greenwich. The connecting train previously originated in New Canaan at 7:58 a.m. and ran express after Stamford. To allow for the added stop at Greenwich, the train will depart from Stamford and all New Canaan Branch stations two minutes earlier. It will now originate at New Canaan at 7:56 a.m. 
 
Waterbury Branch Update 
 
Metro-North will issue updated New Haven Line timetables effective November 16, reflecting the decommissioning of the temporary transfer station for Waterbury Branch customers at Devon and the conclusion of work on the Devon Movable Bridge. At that time, normal Waterbury Branch service will resume. 
 
Hudson Line 
 
The 9:15 a.m. weekday train from Poughkeepsie, which had been adjusted in April to accommodate a construction project, returns to its former schedule, departing Poughkeepsie at 9:00 a.m. 
 
Temporary Schedule for Weekend Construction, October 3 to November 15 
 
Beginning Saturday, October 3, and continuing through Sunday, November 15, Metro-North crews will replace an important complex of track switches near Yankees-E. 153rd Street. As a result, two of the Hudson Line’s three tracks between Marble Hill and Harlem-125th Street will be out of service for seven weekends, and train service will operate with schedule changes. 
 
For electric train service south of Croton-Harmon, local trains will operate normally, but the semi-express trains will operate only between Croton-Harmon and Marble Hill. Customers riding these trains will transfer at Marble Hill to continue their trip, and will experience an increase in travel time of up to six minutes. 
 
Customers using diesel trains that operate north of Croton-Harmon will need to make a cross-platform change of trains at Croton-Harmon. Three southbound trains from Poughkeepsie (the 9:40 a.m. train on Saturdays, and the 10:40 a.m. and 3:40 p.m. trains Saturdays and Sundays) and three northbound trains to Poughkeepsie (the 4:14 p.m. train on Saturdays, and the 5:14 p.m. and 6:14 p.m. trains Saturdays and Sundays) will not operate for the duration of the work. 
 
Metro-North will issue new Hudson Line timetables effective November 16, at the conclusion of this project, and at that time normal weekend service will be restored. 
 
Harlem Line 
 
Trains that stop at Bedford Hills at 4:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays will bypass the station starting Sunday, October 4. Metro-North added these stops for the first time this past spring, and found that it was difficult to allow for essential track maintenance activities with the heightened level of service. Customers from Bedford Hills will continue to have the hourly service that has long existed at the station, with trains departing at 3:35 p.m., 4:35 p.m., 5:35 p.m., and 6:35 p.m.

Here is mine. I ride the train at least once a year and have since it's conception. I, along with the majority of the riders, take the trip to enjoy the beauty and serenity of our beautiful valley. I have never been subjected to the rudeness of a drunken group of people on the train. If I had I would expect the staff to either get them to respect the other riders and hold their noise down or be ejected. 

I think the staff did the right thing. I am afraid the political kowtowing caused by the complaining of the reading club will create the impression that is O.K. to be rude in public and the Wine Train experience will be lessened. Hopefully, I will never encounter the rudeness shown by that reading group.

8573,0fe98f3a-6057-452f-8df2-7811d6cceaf5,Sibling rivalries make for riveting television drama,WA Today,"All in the family: Sibling rivalry between sisters is highlighted in Downton Abbey as Edith (left) and Mary show not a moment of kindliness. The sibling rivalry is a trope as old as civilisation. From Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII to Cain and Abel, to Liam and Noel to Tony Abbott and Christine Forster, unbreakable blood bonds and competition for approval make for high drama.

Here are some of the most fierce, funny and frankly dysfunctional siblings to visit our small screens.

Marcia and Jan Brady – The Brady Bunch: The sibling rivalry is typified by this pair – beautiful, polished and slightly daft Marcia and awkward, bespectacled middle child Jan, who is constantly jealous of her older sister's popularity. The two bicker and compete, with Jan's refrain ""Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!"" becoming the song of exasperated siblings everywhere. Actresses Maureen McCormick and Eve Plumb even took their rivalry off-screen via a long-running feud, with the high animosity between the pair nixing multiple reunion attempts. Thankfully the two fictional sisters always made nice and even ended up having a double wedding and moving into a house together in The Brady Brides, which honestly seems a little too close.

Stefan and Damon Salvatore – The Vampire Diaries: Vampire brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore (Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder) take sibling rivalry to the next level by fighting over the same girl, and then her doppelganger two centuries later. Confused? As the story goes, back in the 1800s the Salvatores were best friends before a love triangle with vampire Katherine Pierce turns them into mortal enemies. Fast forward a few hundred years and the two meet again via their mutual interest in human Elena Gilbert, who happens to be the spitting image of Katherine (played by the same actress, Nina Dobrev) and turns out to be her descendant. Surprise surprise! Cue second torturous love triangle. Nevertheless, the vampires of Mystic Falls lead dangerous, dangerous lives and the two brothers remain loyal to one another as they battle supernatural foes.

Edith and Mary Crawley – Downton Abbey: Most of the sibling rivalries depicted on TV, no matter how fierce, are underpinned by a sincere tenderness that has the opportunity to peek out at least every now and then at moments of critical emotion. Not in Highclere Castle – Mary Crawley's (Michelle Dockery) frostiness knows no boundaries. These two do some seriously cruel things to each other. In season one alone, Edith (Laura Carmichael) reveals to the Turkish ambassador that one of his diplomats, the late but great Kemal Pamuk, died while, ahem, deflowering Mary, painting her as a ruined woman, while Mary lies to unlucky-in-love Edith's suitor, telling him he will get rejected right before he proposes. Not even tragedy can melt Mary's ice-cold heart. When Mr Gregson, the father of Edith's child, is revealed to have been killed by Brownshirt thugs in Germany, did Mary offer a kind word and a tender touch? Nope. ""Well of course it's terrible,"" she tells her maid Anna, ""but what did she think he was doing? Living in a tree?""

Jaime, Cersei and Tyrion Lannister – Game of Thrones: It's difficult to know where to start with these three. The death of their mother during the birth of Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), competition for their father's approval, a torturous love-hate incestuous affair, the murderous impulses of Cersei (Lena Headey) towards Tyrion – yep, the Lannister children take the cake for most dysfunctional onscreen siblings. Well, it was kind of nice when Jamie (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) allowed Tyrion to escape at the end of season four from an execution orchestrated by their sister.

Ray and Robert Barone – Everybody Loves Raymond: The name of the show says it all – everybody loves Raymond (Ray Romano), while older brother Robert (Brad Garrett) always seems to lose out on the affection of their overbearing mother Marie. Parental favouritism is the black shadow hanging over many difficult sibling relationships, and in Raymond it plays out front and centre. Nevertheless, Robert's protective instincts shine through when he defends Ray from bully Jerry Musso, telling him: ""Ray Barone has more talent in the weird pimple on his neck that won't go away than you have in your entire body, you oily two-faced hack. You only wish you could be Ray Barone because you'll never come close to him as a writer, as a father, as a friend or as a person."" Aww.

GOB and Michael Bluth – Arrested Development: First, let's all take one of GOB's trusty ""forget-me-nots"" and pretend the fourth season never happened. The first three, however, brought viewers endless comedy gold via the petty and pointless rivalry of failed magician GOB (Will Arnett) and exasperated do-gooder Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman). The core point of contention between the two is Michael's control over the family company despite being younger. One might sympathise with GOB if he weren't so utterly incompetent, spending his days trying to throw letters into the sea, self-medicating with rohypnol to forget his problems and jumping out of fake Aztec tombs as a career choice.",844,"and slightly daft Marcia and awkward, bespectacled middle child Jan, who is constantly jealous of her older sister's popularity.

On the heels of a trying season that saw him fail to seriously contend in major championships and miss five cuts while his world ranking plummeted, Tiger Woods announced Friday night that he underwent a second microdiscectomy surgery on his back Wednesday.
Woods first underwent this surgery in March of last year, which limited that season to only seven PGA Tour starts.
Editor's PicksTiger Woods' injury timeline
A timeline of Tiger Woods' injuries beginning in 1994, when he was a college golfer at Stanford.
His latest announcement revealed that he won't play any of his three scheduled tournament starts remaining this year, instead saying he is hopeful for an ""early 2016"" return.
""This is certainly disappointing, but I'm a fighter,"" Woods said. ""I've been told I can make a full recovery, and I have no doubt that I will.""
Woods said via his personal website that he had felt discomfort in his back and hip in recent weeks, including during his season-ending 10th-place result at the Wyndham Championship last month. The surgery removed a small disk fragment that was pinching a nerve.
The surgery came as a surprise, said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg. Just last week, Woods had formally committed to play in the Frys.com Open next month. But he had a previously scheduled follow-up doctor exam at which, Steinberg said, an issue in the same area of his back was discovered.Tiger Woods termed his second back surgery in less than two years ""disappointing"" but said he anticipates a full recovery. Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images
""He committed thinking it was going to be a regular checkup,"" Steinberg told ESPN.com. ""Obviously that area where he had the microdiscectomy had to be treated again. And it leads us to where we are now.""
Steinberg would not say how soon after the appointment the surgery was performed but acknowledged ""it was a really quick turnaround. It wasn't what he expected. ... But it was a really quick turnaround not because something had to be done right there right now. It was so he could get back to golf as soon as he can. The doctor has told us that's a good prognosis from that standpoint.""
The announcement on Woods' website states he ""will begin intensive rehabilitation and soft tissue treatment within a week. Healing and recovery times differ for each individual based on many physiological factors, but Tiger is encouraged he can return early in 2016.""
The surgery was performed in Park City, Utah, by neurosurgeon Charles Rich, who also performed the initial microdiscectomy operation.

940289,9626b7d6-0c5c-4962-afdb-352bf9b6cf76,ECSTATIC EVENING AT NCPA - NEO BHARATAM DANCE BY ANITA RATNAM,chummachumma,"Anita Ratnam is a renowned dancer and choreographer. Since her Arangetram at an early age, she has been giving Bharatanatyam performances for more than four decades now. She is also well adept in Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Mohiniaatam, Taichi and Kalaripaayattu dance forms. Trained at a young age by Guru Adyar K Lakshman , she  spent many years at Rukmini Devi’s Kalakshetra and has over the years evolved into a complete dancer. Born and brought up in a Sri Vaishnavite family, she is steeped in the religious culture and ethos of Sri Sampradaya. She can chant Sanskrit sholkas fluently as well as recite paasurams from the Naalayira Divya Prabandham (4000 sacred verses composed by the 12 Ahzwaars and by Thiruvaragathuamudanaar- a devotee of Sri Raamanujaa), who propounded the Vedanta philosophy of Vishishtaadvaita and its related theology, Sri Vaishnavism. Though trained in the classical Bharatanaatyam style, Anita has constantly innovated this dance form and has adapted it to evolve an unique and distinct dance style of her own which she refers to as Neo Bharatam (Bharatanatyam was earlier referred to as Bharatam). On this platform, Anita has made this dance form new, invigorating, modern and very contemporary. On 3rd September, she gave a scintillating performance of a deeply spiritual extravaganza titled “Neelam- Drowning in Bliss”, at the Experimental Theatre, NCPA. It was, as I learnt later, her 50th performance of this dance-drama. The programme started with an introduction of Anita Ratnam and the theme of the solo dance-show by poet Arundhati Subramaniam. She traced back to the Bhakthi movement in South India during the period between the 6th and 9th centuries, when twelve saint-poets called Aazhwaars ( immersed in God) devoted to Lord Vishnu or Tirumaal, the dark one, sang psalms in His praise. Almost during the same period, there were 64 saint-poets called Naayanmaars who sang in praise of Lord Shiva.  Their outpourings are among the earliest devotional hymns in any Indian language. Arundhati Subramaniam aptly quoted one of the verses of Nammaazhwaar (our aazhwaar)  from the English translation of selected verses by poet A. K . Ramanujan. The title of the dance show ‘Drowning in Bliss’ plays on the meanings of such an immersion or diving deep in the love of God . During her formative years, Anita Ratnam had visited many Vaishnavite temples. The architectural beauty of these temples left her in awe and amazement. The distinct tall pillars supporting the hundred pillars and thousand pillar Mandapams and the seemingly never ending corridors where peace and serenity reigned, left a deep impression on her psyche. The quiet chanting of the Vedas and the Divyaprabandham in the background provided her with an ambience of sublime spirituality. She developed a great fascination for Aandaal (one of the twelve Vaishnavite saints and the only woman saint). Aandaal had unparalleled love for the Lord and completely surrendered to him. She exhorted all to do the same and secure their places in Vaikunta. The essence of Vishishtaadvaita philosophy is unconditional surrender (Prapatti) to Lord Vishnu. All individual souls are feminine and are totally dependent on Lord Vishnu, the supreme Soul and Paramapurusha. The dance performance started with the chanting of the Sri Vaishnavite moolamantra- ‘Om Namo Narayanaya’, followed by the first verse of ‘ Sri Venkatesha Suprabhaatam”- the early morning awakening of Lord Srinivaasa at Tirupathi and Periaazhwaar’s (Aandal’s foster father) benediction to the Lord- “Pallandu Pallandu………” (may you live for thousands of aeons). There were four sections to the show. The first part had the procession of Lord Vishnu at Thirukkurungudi. In the second part, the subject was Aandaal where she expresses her envy for Paanchajanya, the conch of Lord Krishna which enjoys absolute proximity to the Lord which Aandal is yearning for. She wants to know how her beloved Lord’s lips taste and she repeatedly asks the conch “Karpooram naarumo, kamalappoo naarumo,(how does it smell, like camphor or like the lotus flower?), “shol aazhi ven shange” (please answer me you white conch) . In the third part is the dance where Mahalakshmi arose from the ocean during the great churning of the ocean in search of Amritam and garlanded Lord Vishnu. In the last part was the story of Lord Rama in Srirangam. She danced to Muthuswamy Dikshitar’s composition. She used a ragam-tanam-pallavi format of Dikshitar's 'Rangapura vihara' sung by Sikkil Gurucharan to visualise Lord Ranganatha through the Ramayana and the Dasavatara. Flutist R Raghuraman was perched on the top of the stage and played so well that he received applause from the audience for his wonderful brilliance constantly reminding me of the magic of Lord Krishna’s flute playing skills conveyed in Periaazhwar’s hymns. Arvind Srinivasan’s piano for the section on Mahalakshmi was absolutely sublime. Anita with her choice of colour for the costumes was a showstopper. For the first one on Lord Vishnu (Nambi) in a temple procession in Thirukurungudi she wore a yellow dress, for the second part as Aaandal she wore a golden costume, for the third part as Mahalakshmi she wore a shining lotus pink dress and for the last part of Lord Rama she wore a striking blue dress in consonance with the colour of the ocean (neelam). Visual design was one of the outstanding features of “Neelam”. After the dance performance was over, the audience was invited to talk with Arundhati Subramaniam and Anita Ratnam who were on stage. It was an enjoyable tete-a-tete after the first few seconds of stunning silence when everyone was expecting another person to break the ice. The feeling was not the usual terror of audience participation but one of warmth and inclusion. Anita articulated her ideas well and with Arundhati’s imploring questions and comments, she handled them tactfully and gracefully. The finale was when one person asked Anita what was her idea of bliss. To which pat came the reply “ After all the rigours of the day, my idea of bliss is to get back to my hotel room and eat a bowl of curd rice”. The settings of the dance theatre, the incredible costumes created by visual designer Rex, the lingering melodies of the flute and the piano and the elegant dances by Anita Ratnam resulted in an ecstatic and unforgettable evening for the audience. For Anita Ratnam, dance is a language of faith. The fond memories will linger on.                                                 ",1051,"recite paasurams from the Naalayira Divya Prabandham (4000 sacred verses composed by the 12 Ahzwaars and by Thiruvaragathuamudanaar- a devotee of Sri Raamanujaa), who propounded the Vedanta philosophy of Vishishtaadvaita and its related theology, Sri Vaishnavism.

The Abbott government has walked away from a plan to impose a tax on bank deposits, a proposal that was expected to deliver revenue of $500 million a year. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey announced on Tuesday the government would not proceed with the tax, a move Mr Abbott said was ""good news for the people of Australia"".

""The last way to make our banks strong, the last way to protect depositors, is to hit banks with more taxes. That's the Labor way. It's not the Coalition's way,"" Mr Abbott said.

A bank deposit levy was first proposed by the former Labor government and the Coalition had already factored the revenue into its May budget.

The decision to dump it could cost the budget $2 billion in lost revenue.

The 0.05 per cent levy was to be imposed on all bank deposits up to $250,000, with the money to be invested in a Financial Stability Fund as insurance in the event of a bank collapse.

It was understood Mr Hockey, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had been arguing internally for the measure to help the government's revenue, but backbenchers had been pushing for the plan to be dumped arguing the revenue was not worth the political pain that would come with a tax.

Mr Hockey denied this was the case on Tuesday and that he only ever planned to consult with the industry.

""You are wrong. We have been actively consulting with a range of different people including stakeholders and formed the view, after consultation some days ago - in fact, more than a week ago I spoke to the Prime Minister and said this is bad policy in light of the new capital requirements for the major financial institutions,"" Mr Hockey said.

The Treasurer said it was now up to Labor to declare ""their own deposit tax is dead"".

""They used this simply as a way of trying to fatten up the bottom line when they were in quite desperate straits,"" he said.

""I have consulted widely across many stakeholders in relation to this tax, looked carefully at different options but there is no good option. The only good option is to abolish the tax and not proceed with it.""

Banking groups welcomed the move, which the Australian Bankers' Association said was ""a wise policy decision and a welcome end to the uncertainty for savers"".

""Millions of Australians who rely on their savings for current and future income would have been hurt by this tax, including many self-funded retirees,"" ABA's executive director of industry policy Tony Pearson said.

Mark Degotardi, chief executive of the Customer Owned Banking Association said: ""The decision supports the more competitive and resilient financial system recommended by the independent Financial System Inquiry.""

But Greens treasury spokesman Adam Bandt said it was a backflip that meant the big banks had won and the government had ""blown another hole"" in budget revenue.

""Why make this announcement now? Has the public lost billions in revenue just so a Prime Minister and Treasurer under pressure could appear smiling together in front of the cameras?"" he said.

""The big four banks make world-leading record profits, yet the government doesn't have the guts to ask them to pay a bit more tax.""

""The last way to make our banks strong, the last way to cut our dependency on Australian tax debts is to change the definition of Quickfire credit stubs, which must now be changed to Quickfire credit accounts, so I will take on a new approach in terms of voting to continue our mandatory share payments and giving consumers a better credit card choice, not just because I want to change the way we charge fees but also because I like the fact that we"," thing is they break down,"" he told reporters following his victory at an emergency meeting after being sworn in as prime minister earlier this week. Business groups slammed budget measures introduced by Labor MPs – which include raising taxes across sections or increasing fees levied only against Australians living overseas - but did little comment until hours later when their leaders came out ahead so enthusiastically cheering them despite opposition testimony showing more than 60 per cent had voted (AFP Photo/Carlos Barria)

109841,aaa1e7f1-fa73-42f4-a3ae-16914c0f12ea,Ford Mustang Mach 1 Twister,Silodrome,"Ford Mustang Mach 1 Twister 

The 1970 Ford Mustang Mach 1 Twister was a special edition car offered only to dealers in the Kansas City area, 96 were made in total and today they regularly command prices at auction well in excess of $100,000 USD. 

The strategy behind the Twister Mustang was a simple one – Ford wanted to sell more cars and they’d had considerable success in the past with the California Special GT Mustang, another car only offered in a specific geographic location. 

The Twister name came from the tornadoes that often tore through the Kansas countryside, this being seen as an effective metaphor for the intentions of the kind of people that would order a 300+ hp Twister. 

Grabber Orange was the only color available for the model, with exclusive “Twister Special” graphics that were applied at the Ford assembly plant in Kansas City. Originally it had been intended that the 428 Super Cobra Jet engine would be fitted to all 96 cars, but an engine shortage resulted in half the cars being fitted with the 351 Cleveland V8. All engines fitted to Twisters were blueprinted and offered with either an automatic or manual transmissions. 

The car you see here is one of the 48 fitted with the 351 Cleveland, it’s still fitted with its original matching numbers drivetrain, Magnum 500 wheels, rear window Sport Slats, dual racing-style mirrors, a shaker hood with hood tie-downs, spoilers front and back, Twister graphics, air-conditioning, power steering and power brakes. 

The 1970 Mustang has long been a contentious car, some love the design and some think it was a step too far away from the styling of the original ’64 model. I’ve always personally been in the former camp – in fact I’d go so far as to say that the 1970 Mustang is one of the best looking designs from the first generation.

The radio drama's editor Sean O'Connor revealed that Lord Hall called him directly to say sorry for siding with the comment made during a Radio Times interview. 
 
O'Connor told Radio Times: ""I was a bit annoyed, but he rang me at 7.30 in the morning and said that he was terribly sorry. And I said: 'You do know it's getting an extra 3.5 million listeners on the podcast? That it's doing as well as it did in the 50s?' And he said he apologised and we were doing a wonderful job."" 
 
O'Connor denied that Ambridge was going the way of Walford. ""In EastEnders, for example, so many people have died that the audience is inured to character deaths. The feeling among the senior actors in The Archers is that they don't want their characters to die before them so we make no plans for their departure."" 
 
The history of The Archers will be up for debate as a new radio play explores the real story behind the death of character Grace Archer on September 22 1955. Archer burnt to death in a barn fire on the same day rival corporation ITV launched and it was commonly believed the BBC sacrificed her to win the ratings war. 
 
O'Connor, who directed the new play, Dead Girls Tell No Tales, said that that legend was not true. 
 
""That is the folklore I inherited, and is what most of the people on the show believe, apart from the senior executives, who knew the truth. But there were slightly different versions of that truth, some of them more melodramatic than others,"" he revealed. 
 
O'Connor's radio play, scripted by long-time Archer's writer Joanna Toye, explores the idea that enmity between Ysanne Churchman, who voiced Grace Archer, and the show's first editor, Godfrey Baseley, was the real reason she was killed off. 
   Promoted stories   
Former Archers' editor William Smethurst claimed in his 1990 book that Baseley admitted the reason for Archer's death was his anger with Churchman over her insistence on equal pay for actresses. 
 
This storyline will be examined, as will O'Connor's belief that Baseley used the launch of ITV as a cover to get rid of Churchman, in the vein of the Westminster tactic of ""burying bad news"".

287068,0b85588f-31bf-4488-873f-97157da01ce6,"Big 12 has 4 teams with 100-yard receiver, 100-yard rusher",Las Vegas Sun,"Published Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015 | 12:24 p.m. Baylor often makes reference to itself as #WRU — or Wide Receiver U.

While generally an apt description for the fifth-ranked Bears with their big-play receivers, that doesn't tell the full story for Baylor — or the Big 12 Conference.

Big 12 teams certainly know how to throw the ball down the field, with four of the nation's top eight passing offenses. But they can also run.

Baylor, fourth-ranked TCU, No. 23 West Virginia and Texas Tech all have at least one running back averaging 100 yards per game to go with a receiver gaining more than 100 yards a game.

That is four Big 12 teams with such 100-100 duos. Indiana, with the Big Ten's top receiver and rusher, is the only other team in a Power Five conference with a double threat like that. Notre Dame has a dynamic duo, too.

""If you watch the whole game film and look at the whole numbers, it's not like it's 80-20 pass, it's more around 55-45, 60-40 pass to run,"" Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said. ""Teams in this league do a good job mixing it up, and the run really does set up a lot of the big plays.""

A look at the 100-100 duos — or, in some cases, trios — in the Big 12: BAYLOR: While the Bears have become well-known under coach Art Briles for their receivers, including Corey Coleman (Big 12-best 153.3 yards per game, FBS-best eight touchdowns), they also have the nation's top rushing offense with 379.7 yards per game. They are the most balanced team in the league, splitting their nation's best 767 total yards a game almost evenly through the air and on the ground. Shock Linwood's 121 yards rushing per game top the Big 12, while Terence Williams gains 101.7 yards per game. Surprisingly, Baylor throws on only 39 percent of its plays — only Texas and Kansas State pass less — but has a three-TD receiver in every game so far.

WEST VIRGINIA: Mountaineers coach Dana Holgorsen strives for being as balanced as possible. ""That's not the yardage output or any of the amount of plays that we throw it, or amount of plays we run, it's more about having the ability to be able to take what the defense is giving you,"" he said. ""We feel like we're in the position we can do both."" And they are with receiver Shelton Gibson (109.7 yards receiving a game) and running back Wendell Smallwood (110.3 rushing yards per game), not to mention a quarterback in junior Skylar Howard that Holgorsen said ""can run around a little bit.""

TCU: Horned Frogs coach Gary Patterson has often talked about receiver Josh Doctson and running back Aaron Green playing themselves into shape after being slowed by some nagging issues. Well, they are quite a productive pair. Doctson's numbers have improved each week, and he matched a Big 12 record that had stood since the league's inaugural 1996 season with 18 catches (for 267 yards and three touchdowns) against Texas Tech. He averages 148.3 yards receiving per game. Green is running for 109 yards a game, with three consecutive two-TD games, but also had TCU's biggest catch so far this season — that highlight-stealing grab in the back in the end zone of a pass that deflected off Doctson's hands in the final minute of the 55-52 win over the Red Raiders last week.

TEXAS TECH: As a player, Kingsbury was in a long line of Texas Tech quarterbacks who could sling the ball with the best. The Kingsbury-coached Red Raiders still throw the ball 58 percent of the time — more than any other Big 12 team — but have tailback DeAndre Washington (118.8 yards rushing per game) to go with Jakeem Grant (103.2 yards receiving per game) and two of the league's other top-10 players in receiving yards. Texas Tech gets about two-thirds of its yards through the air, as do Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Iowa State.",672,"a receiver gaining more than 100 yards a game. That is four Big 12 teams with such 100-100 duos. Indiana, with the Big Ten's top receiver and rusher, is the only other team in a Power Five conference with a double threat like that. Notre Dame has a dynamic duo, too. ""If you watch the whole game film and look at the whole numbers, it's not like it's 80-20 pass, it's more around 55-45, 60-40 pass to run,"" Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said. ""Teams in this league do a good job mixing it up, and the run really does set up a lot of the big plays."" A look at the 100-100 duos — or, in some cases, trios — in the Big 12: BAYLOR: While the Bears have become well-known under coach Art Briles for their receivers, including Corey Coleman (Big 12-best 153.3 yards per game, FBS-best eight touchdowns), they also have the nation's top rushing offense with 379.7 yards per game. They are the most balanced team in the league, splitting their nation's best 767 total yards a game almost evenly through the air and on the ground. Shock Linwood's 121 yards rushing per game top the Big 12, while Terence Williams gains 101.7 yards per game. Surprisingly, Baylor throws on only 39 percent of its plays — only Texas and Kansas State pass less — but has a three-TD receiver in every game so far. WEST VIRGINIA: Mountaineers coach Dana Holgorsen strives for being as balanced as possible. ""That's not the yardage output or any of the amount of plays that we throw it, or amount of plays we run, it's more about having the ability to be able to take what the defense is giving you,"" he said. ""We feel like we're in the position we can do both."" And they are with receiver Shelton Gibson (109.7 yards receiving a game) and running back Wendell Smallwood (110.3 rushing yards per game), not to mention a quarterback in junior Skylar Howard that Holgorsen said ""can run around a little bit."" TCU: Horned Frogs coach Gary Patterson has often talked about receiver Josh Doctson and running back Aaron Green playing themselves into shape after being slowed by some nagging issues. Well, they are quite a productive pair. Doctson's numbers have improved each week, and he matched a Big 12 record that had stood since the league's inaugural 1996 season with 18 catches (for 267 yards and three touchdowns) against Texas Tech. He averages 148.3 yards receiving per game. Green is running for 109 yards a game, with three consecutive two-TD games, but also had TCU's biggest catch so far this season — that highlight-stealing grab in the back in the end zone of a pass that deflected off Doctson's hands in the final minute of the 55-52 win over the Red Raiders last week. TEXAS TECH: As a player, Kingsbury was in a long line of Texas Tech quarterbacks who could sling the ball with the best. The Kingsbury-coached Red Raiders still throw the ball 58 percent of the time — more than any other Big 12 team — but have tailback DeAndre Washington (118.8 yards rushing per game) to go with Jakeem Grant (103.2 yards receiving per game) and two of the league's other top-10 players in receiving yards.

The England striker, who spent most of the summer undergoing rehabilitation in the United States, returned to full training with the rest of the squad this week after recovering from a hip operation in May. 
  Daniel Sturridge, pictured, is the fittest he has been for 18 months, according to manager Brendan Rodgers   
He will not be ready for Saturday's match against Manchester United at Old Trafford but his impending return will boost a goal-shy squad which has scored just two goals in four matches and none in their last two. 

			 
""There is no timeline as to when he will be fit to participate in the game but he is obviously back in training, which is good,"" said Rodgers. 



 
""He looked really sharp in training, probably the best he's looked fitness-wise for 18 months, and it will be really good when he gets back. 

""I can never say that (he is over the worst of his injuries) because I don't want to sit here and something happens in a couple of months' time. 

""I can only look at what I see and from my experiences in the past I don't want to put any timeline on him coming back. 

""I am grateful for the work done in America, for our own medical team who have done a brilliant job to do everything they possibly could to get Daniel back to a level of fitness. 

			 
""He has worked hard. He has joined in with the group and we will take it from there, day-by-day."" 

Liverpool go into Saturday's game having been humiliated 3-0 at home by West Ham before the international break which saw them concede their first goals of the season. 

Having only scored twice in four matches - with those coming in the opening two games - the side are also struggling up front. 

Last season they went to Old Trafford and enjoyed the majority of chances only to lose 3-0, but Rodgers is confident there will be no repeat of the shambolic defensive performance against the Hammers. 

			 
Dejan Lovren came in for most criticism as his mistake led to the crucial second goal but his manager has backed the Croatia international, who endured a tough start to his Liverpool career last season, to bounce back. 

""Like all the players know we performed below our level in that game but it was a collective,"" added Rodgers. 

""We can't isolate any performance on to one player. Dejan knows he made a mistake and you have to live with that as a player. 

""We never stick the blame on to one player. We fell below the standards in that game. 

""In his first three games he showed he has that quality and consistency to defend well, so the key is letting go of the mistake and showing your character."" 

			 
Liverpool will be without suspended playmaker Philippe Coutinho on Saturday after his red card against West Ham, so striker Danny Ings or winger Jordon Ibe are in contention to start.

When taking advantage of Premier Resort Vacations' amazing vacation packages in beautiful Mazatlán, travelers will find myriad opportunities for exploration and adventure. From the beaches and shopping to the Malecón of Mazatlán and the lighthouse El Faro, this Pacific Coast paradise has something for every taste. 

Those vacationers who are looking for something different and exciting to do when staying in Mazatlán will enjoy seeing some of the best martial artists in the world compete in the International Karate Championship LPK Mexico 2015 at Mazatlán International Center from Sept. 25 through 27. 
   
Premier Resort Vacations says this event is considered one of the best martial competitions in Latin America. Athletes at all levels come to LPK Mexico in search of international exposure and the chance to face the best of the best. 

The competition will be governed under the current regulations of the Kata and Kumite WFK and there will be several competitions in each category. In Kata, the competitors do not face an opponent; they perform choreographed movements and patterns either alone or in teams. The Kata competitions include three-round green belt Kata matches; black belt Kata matches; and black belt Kata team matches. The latter falls into men's and women's categories and is also broken up by age group: 15 through 17, and 18 or older.

It was a great year as we opened up 2017's season opener against WGC National Champion Kim ""Eddie"" Jaewoo with 1st place finish after beating Hwang-Jin Park (by 2) 3–0 by forfeit: Tae Woo Suk during their post match celebration on October 26. To be able return home more money must have been put into organizing these matches than just being there instead of playing pool :). In order not only would one win get you away again but it gives them even less time because they're forced to decide each day how much better or safer life could feel without having actual fights happen between opponents within 24 hours due either way no food can live comfortably so people lose stamina early while most events start shortly afterwards too often

While hip hop culture encompasses a variety of stylistic components including breakdancing and graffiti, it is the MCs, rappers and DJs that provide the musical soundtrack behind this cultural phenomenon and Empire’s first season is peppered with musical performances and cameo appearances from some of the genre’s biggest names including Snoop Dogg and Mary J Blige. 
 
Born out of the Bronx in the 1970s, hip hop has gained millions of fans and established cultural significance around the world. We’d like to take you on a whistle-stop tour of some hip hop’s defining moments from the past four decades. 
 

 
1970’s 
 
The roots of hip hop can be found in the block parties that took place in the neighbourhoods of the South Bronx where teenagers would take melodies and beats from existing records and combine them with their own words and rhymes, chronicling their lives and battling their peers. 
 
DJ Kool Herc is widely regarded as the Godfather of hip hop and was one of the first DJs to use two turntables. He created the blueprint for hip hop culture and his apartment at 1520 Sedgewick Avenue has even been recognised by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as the birthplace of hip hop. 
 
Released in 1979, Sugarhill Gang’s ‘Rapper’s Delight’ was one of the first rap records to gain mainstream popularity. Blondie’s ‘Rapture’ was released the same year and was the first major single by a white artist to feature elements of hip hop. 
 

 
Sugarhill Gang 
 
1980’s 
 
Grand Master Flash is credited as being the first DJ to use scratching and cutting techniques. His single ‘The Message’, released in 1982, was one of the first hip hop songs to address social issues in its lyrics, paving the way for artists like Run DMC and Public Enemy whose lyrical content was also firmly rooted in the real world. 
Founder of the Universal Zulu Nation Afrika Bambaataa was another hugely influential figure in hip hop. His 1982 single ‘Planet Rock’ fused electronic sounds and samples with hip hop, kickstarting the diversification of hip hop into a whole host of musical sub-genres. 
 
The mid 1980’s to the early 1990s is regarded by many as hip hop’s golden age with a far more diverse range of artists emerging, including Public Enemy, Eric B & Rakim, De La Soul, Gang Starr, Beastie Boys and A Tribe Called Quest. 
 

 
Afrika Bambaataa 
 
1990’s 
 
Hip hop’s popularity continued to explode with records such as Tone Loc’s ‘Wild Thing’ and Public Enemy’s ‘Fight The Power’ among the standout singles. The decade also witnessed the birth of one of hip hop’s most controversial styles, Gangsta Rap, bristling with angry lyrics that reflected the violent inner-city lifestyles lived by many of the artists that performed it. The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A’s ‘Straight Outta Compton’. N.W.A. member Dr Dre went on to create a new style called G-Funk which was popularised by artists such as Snoop Dogg and Warren G. 
 
The more mainstream commercial face of hip hop continued to grow with MC Hammer becoming one of most successful rappers of the 1990s along with Vanilla Ice whose ‘Ice Ice Baby’ became the first hip hop single to top the US Billboard Charts. 
 
The latter part of the decade saw artists such as the Wu-Tang Clan, Diddy and the Fugees come to prominence and brought continued success for the Beastie Boys. 
 

 
MC Hammer 
 
2000’s 
 
The new millennium saw Dr Dre moving to the other side of the mixing desk to produce some of hip hop’s most successful albums for artists such as Eminem and 50 Cent. 
 
However it was Jay-Z’s rise from artist to label president to global brand that underlined hip hop’s ongoing cultural impact. Jay Z also broke Elvis Presley’s record for the most number one albums on the Billboard charts by a solo artist. 
 
No surprise, then, that Empire writer Danny Strong says that Jay-Z’s story had a strong influence on the show’s Lucious Lyon character.

There are many annoying things that transpire around you when working at a theme park, but by far the worst is repetitive noise. Things like the repeating park soundtrack, shows that play near you a dozen times a day, games barkers that say the same thing over and over on their microphones, etc. Theme park management usually does nothing to help people keep their sanity when things get out of hand, so sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. 
 
Way back in the 80’s when I worked as a caricaturist at Six Flags Great America, we had a location right next to a ground speaker that was basically stuck on full volume. Listening to the repeating soundtrack all day is bad enough, but when the volume and proximity to the speaker actually interferes with you being able to talk to your customers, something needs to get fixed. The manager of our operation, Gary, tried to get the park to adjust the volume or move the speaker, but they just ignored him. So, he would periodically use a multi-tool to cut the wires of the speaker or otherwise sabotage it so it would not work. It would take a few days before someone in park management would notice the speaker was out, and another day or two before they’d fix it. Gary would just sabotage it again, and then played dumb if they asked him about it. I’ve been told he did that for years. 
 
Years later I took a page out of Gary’s book when Six Flags St. Louis put a loudspeaker on top of a building next to one of our locations and had the speaker pointing right at our booth. After close one night I climbed up onto that roof and turned the speaker around to point away from us. Later we disconnected the speaker entirely. I don’t think the park ever noticed. 
 
The worst noise annoyance problem of all happened in the summer of 1990 when I was managing an operation at Six Flags Atlanta. We had a couple of locations in the park but the main one was located in a kind of central midway area. This booth was built like a wrap-around “porch” on the outside of a fairly large candy store, and was by far our busiest spot. Well… it was in front of a candy store during the 1989 season. When we came in to set up the booth the next spring, we discovered they’d replaced the candy store with a karaoke recording studio . They also set up huge speakers right in our faces to play a repeating demo tape of horrible karaoke performances. 
 
If I would have had to listen to Six Flags patrons singing awful versions of country tunes all summer, I would have been dead by August. Knowing we had no chance to get the park to do anything about this, we took matters into our own hands. We went into the recording studio and confronted the manager, telling her that if we had to listen to their demo reel all day every day, we were going to have to record the one they used ourselves. She agreed to our compromise. 
 
So, all summer long we listened to our artist’s renditions of 70’s and 80’s tunes… and a couple of “Madonna” numbers by the nearby puppet show personality “Buford Buzzard”. Eddie Pittman did mean version of The Eagles “Desperado”. My Billy Idol numbers sounded like a cat being tortured. It could have been worse, but I still sometimes wake up in a cold sweat with Buford’s “Like a Virgin” echoing in my ears.",622,"the 80’s when I worked as a caricaturist at Six Flags Great America, we had a location right next to a ground speaker that was basically stuck on full volume.

Only months ago baby Sienna was smiling and dancing as her family celebrated her first birthday. It is a memory relatives are clinging to as they mourn the deaths of the 17-month-old and her mother in a suspected murder-suicide.

A relative of the pair arrived at the home in Campsie on Monday afternoon and discovered the body of 29-year-old Phuong Cao.

Her daughter, who was born visually impaired, was found nearby.

The woman was pronounced dead at the scene while paramedics worked desperately to save the baby.

Police officers drove the ambulance to St George Hospital so paramedics could try to resuscitate the little girl.

However she was pronounced dead on arrival.

Police say both died from asphyxiation.

Friends and relatives visited Sienna's father and Ms Cao's husband on Tuesday as he returned to the Fitzroy Street home.

Friend Dang remembered marking Sienna's birthday in April.

""Everyone was singing happy birthday and she was smiling, she was dancing..."" he said.

Dang said Ms Cao was a ""dedicated"" mother and her husband was struggling to understand the tragedy.

""I don't think he has understood really what has happened yet,"" he said.

""I think he is still in denial. He was saying the little one needed medication.""

One neighbour described the family as loving and kind but admitted Ms Cao seemed upset and to be struggling.

He said he saw an ambulance arrive at the home to treat Ms Cao a month ago.

Campsie Police Superintendent Michael McLean said some of the officers were devastated by the outcome on Monday.

""I've just been back at Campsie police station where a number of police officers who attended the scene and drove the ambulance to hospital and assisted in the treatment of the child on the way to hospital,"" he said.

""They are clearly devastated and traumatised by what occurred.""

Friends wrote tributes and posted photos on social media as news of the tragedy spread.

Lee Dan said he wished he could hug Ms Cao one last time.

""...stronger and deeper to say goodbye because I know you are in another world, happier, pieced (sic) and untroubled,"" he posted on Facebook.

Ga Con wrote she wanted her friend to ""rest in peace"" in a world that was happy.

Detectives will speak to friends and family members as they try to piece together what happened and whether post-natal depression or mental illness was a factor.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc, the company behind the popular ride-hailing service, said on Thursday it would appeal a court decision that ordered it to shut down its unlicensed service UberPOP in Brussels. 
 
The legal decision came in a case brought by a taxi operator. Uber has faced numerous lawsuits and protests by conventional taxi companies who see the service, which operates through an app, as unfair competition. 
 
France, Italy, Spain and Germany have already outlawed UberPOP, siding with taxi companies that argued the service did not conform with local transportation rules. 
 
""The decision means UberPOP will be required to stop in 21 days in Brussels,"" Uber said in a statement. Uber will appeal that decision, it said, and a spokesman added the company had not yet decided on whether to shut down the service. 
 
Earlier this week, France's Constitutional Court upheld a national law that banned UberPOP, which relies on non-professional drivers using their own vehicles. 
 
Uber's entry into the Belgian market in 2014 was greeted with fierce opposition from taxi companies. Last week, hundreds of taxi drivers staged a large protest in central Brussels. 
 
Taxis Verts, the operator who brought the case, was not immediately available for comment.

Toronto Blue Jays' starting pitcher David Price laughs after catching a line drive off the bat of Baltimore Orioles' Manny Machado during sixth inning MLB baseball action in Toronto on Saturday, September 5, 2015. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese"" 
  
TORONTO - David Price got to 100 career wins by respecting every lineup he faced. 

Price allowed one run in seven innings for his 100th career victory as the Blue Jays topped the Orioles 5-1 on Saturday. The victory ended Toronto's three-game skid against Baltimore and Price earned his first win over the Orioles since Sept. 20, 2013. 

""I don't look at any opponent to be any different,"" said Price. ""I'm probably a little bit more familiar with their lineup facing those guys as many times as I have in my career. Their team, for the most part, has kind of stayed the same so it's a club that always swings the bat well against me. 

""It's been a while since I've beaten them so that was good."" 

The Blue Jays (77-58) improved to 8-6 this season against the Orioles while Baltimore (65-70) dropped to 3-13 in its last 16 games. 

Toronto's win coupled with the New York Yankees' loss to Tampa Bay, gave the Blue Jays a game and a half lead for first place in the American League East. 

Price (14-5) gave up an RBI single to Caleb Joseph in the seventh. The lefty finished the game by allowing three hits while striking out eight for his fifth win as a member of the Jays. It was Price's fourth home start since being acquired from the Detroit Tigers in July. 

""He was great. At the end of the day, that's why he's here,"" said Blue Jays manager John Gibbons. ""Against a tough-hitting lineup — he faced most of those guys in that lineup so many times — makes it (even tougher) facing guys like that and to shut them down. It's pretty impressive."" 

Orioles right-hander Mike Wright (2-4) went four innings allowing three earned runs on seven hits and striking out four. Wright lasted just 1 1/3 innings in his last start against the Blue Jays in June. 

""I got the loss, so I didn't pitch very well, but I felt good. They're just a really good hitting team,"" said Wright. ""I had zero confidence going into that game (last time vs Toronto). I have no idea why. I wasn't attacking and I tried to attack a lot more today than I did last time. 

""You have no chance to get an out if you don't throw strikes. I felt like attacked the zone pretty well today. That's a positive."" 

Jose Bautista got Toronto on the board in the first with his 32nd home run of the season. The Blue Jays right-fielder added to the lead in the third with a ground rule double that scored Kevin Pillar. 

Toronto took a 3-0 lead in the fourth on Ben Revere's RBI single. 

The Jays added to their lead in the fifth with Justin Garcia on in relief. Troy Tulowitzki scored on an RBI ground out by Russell Martin. Ryan Goins then hit a ground rule double to left centre that scored Justin Smoak giving Toronto a 5-0 lead. 

Bautista showed off his defensive game in the ninth inning by tracking a pop fly from Steve Pearce in shallow centre and making a diving grab. 

Notes: The Blue Jays will send RHP Marco Estrada (11-8, 3.16 ERA) to the mound in Sunday's series finale against the Orioles. LHP Mark Buehrle, who was supposed to start on Sunday, will now get the ball in Monday's series opener in Boston. The Orioles will counter with RHP Chris Tilman (9-10, 4.87 ERA).

283042,3278cb19-df58-42c6-9f13-7a4d0551e1aa,Do You Discover Plumbing Complicated? Usage This Guidance,blogigo.pl,"While it's the source of life, water is the enemy of a homeowner facing plumbing problems. There is not a lot besides a natural disaster that can damage a house more than a huge plumbing problem. This article will give you some great tips to help you avoid a plumbing disaster.Don't pay a plumber midway through the job. Sometimes it is required to put a little money down before the job starts, but don't ever pay the whole amount before you know the task is done correctly. You will feel better paying the bill when you are completely satisfied with the job.Don't be tempted to use commercial bleach tablets, blue toilet tablets or any other product that claims to prevent toilet odor. These products may well remove odors, but they have the side effect of damaging the rubber in your toilet, which can prevent your toilet from functioning correctly.To ensure garbage disposal lasts long in your home, be sure you keep it cleaned regularly. If your garbage disposal begins to emit a bad smell, run some dish detergent and citrus rinds through the cycle to make it smell fresher.Run cold water through your garbage disposal. Cold water will allow for the food particles to be properly disposed of while keeping the blades sharp. If you use hot water it will liquefy the grease, allowing it to accumulate in your drain causing your pipes to clog.Use cold water when using your garbage disposal. Cold water keeps blades sharp and encourage a smoother disposal. If you use hot water, any grease that is in the disposal will turn to liquid, and sit inside of the drain, which can clog your pipes.Ensure that your sink's overflow holes are clear. You may not even notice the overflow holes on your sink, but if you have a major water leak you will soon regret your apathy. Make cleaning debris from the overflow holes part of your regular routine of maintaining your plumbing and checking it for problems and required repairs.Be sure to regularly clean out the lint trap that is in your dryer. This not only prevents fires, but saves money. Look over the lint trap to make sure there aren't any rips or holes. This can cause problems like clogs.Make sure a new shower head is of high quality. People usually opt for a cheap shower head instead of a quality product. These types of fixtures are prone to breakage and are much less sturdy.Don't treat your toilet like a garbage can if you want to avoid a lot of potential plumbing problems. Never flush paper towels, tissue, diapers, or tampons. These things do not break up correctly and can clog your pipes. Reduce your use of toilet paper if you notice frequent clogs.There are two ways to remove stubborn clean-out plugs. Try to use a hammer and chisel to http://plombierlille.blogspot.fr/ - http://plombierlille.blogspot.fr/ - loosen it. Your other option to try is to chisel through the out plug.You need to make sure outside faucets are covered and not dripping as winter approaches. If there are problems, you must make the needed fixes prior to the arrival of freezing temperatures. Regardless of what the pipes in your house are made out of, freezing water will cause them to crack. Even tiny cracks can cause a lot of flood or water damage to your home.Take the time to ensure that everyone in your family knows how to cut off the water from the valve in your home. You can locate a water meter close to it. Some plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and toilets, may have individual shut-off valves. Show each family member the location of the valves, and mark them so people can turn them off in an emergency.Get a hot water tank that is adapted to your needs to improve your water heater efficiency. Take into consideration the size of your household and the number of appliances that require hot water to find the right size.When doing the install on a water heater, keep an eye out for unconnected pipes.

Don't be tempted to use commercial bleach tablets, blue toilet tablets or any other product that claims to prevent toilet odor. These products may well remove odors, but they have the side effect of damaging the rubber in your toilet, which can prevent your toilet from functioning correctly. To ensure garbage disposal lasts long in your home, be sure you keep it cleaned regularly. If your garbage disposal begins to emit a bad smell, run some dish detergent and citrus rinds through the cycle to make it smell fresher. Run cold water through your garbage disposal. Cold water will allow for the food particles to be properly disposed of while keeping the blades sharp. If you use hot water it will liquefy the grease, allowing it to accumulate in your drain causing your pipes to clog. Use cold water when using your garbage disposal. Cold water keeps blades sharp and encourage a smoother disposal. If you use hot water, any grease that is in the disposal will turn to liquid, and sit inside of the drain, which can clog your pipes. Ensure that your sink's overflow holes are clear. You may not even notice the overflow holes on your sink, but if you have a major water leak you will soon regret your apathy. Make cleaning debris from the overflow holes part of your regular routine of maintaining your plumbing and checking it for problems and required repairs. Be sure to regularly clean out the lint trap that is in your dryer. This not only prevents fires, but saves money. Look over the lint trap to make sure there aren't any rips or holes. This can cause problems like clogs. Make sure a new shower head is of high quality. People usually opt for a cheap shower head instead of a quality product. These types of fixtures are prone to breakage and are much less sturdy. Don't treat your toilet like a garbage can if you want to avoid a lot of potential plumbing problems. Never flush paper towels, tissue, diapers, or tampons. These things do not break up correctly and can clog your pipes. Reduce your use of toilet paper if you notice frequent clogs. There are two ways to remove stubborn clean-out plugs. Try to use a hammer and chisel to http://plombierlille.blogspot.fr/ - http://plombierlille.blogspot.fr/ - loosen it. Your other option to try is to chisel through the out plug. You need to make sure outside faucets are covered and not dripping as winter approaches. If there are problems, you must make the needed fixes prior to the arrival of freezing temperatures. Regardless of what the pipes in your house are made out of, freezing water will cause them to crack. Even tiny cracks can cause a lot of flood or water damage to your home. Take the time to ensure that everyone in your family knows how to cut off the water from the valve in your home. You can locate a water meter close to it. Some plumbing fixtures, such as sinks and toilets, may have individual shut-off valves. Show each family member the location of the valves, and mark them so people can turn them off in an emergency. Get a hot water tank that is adapted to your needs to improve your water heater efficiency. Take into consideration the size of your household and the number of appliances that require hot water to find the right size. When doing the install on a water heater, keep an eye out for unconnected pipes. A commonly missed pipe is the one that leads out from the area for drainage. This could be one of the recirculation pipes, which helps your water stay warm without wasting it. Rest for a while after doing work outdoors for a long time.

213481,e431d2b0-6588-4a62-9f09-611a9bf4c0a7,Taxpayers on hook for Gov. Scott's misdeeds,TCPalm,"In too many cases recently, when the governor, the Legislature or the Cabinet violate our Constitution or state statutes, they turn to Florida taxpayers to foot the bill. 

Gov. Rick Scott recently agreed to pay Tallahassee attorney Steve Andrews $700,000 to end a lawsuit alleging the governor and several members of his staff violated state law when they created private email accounts to shield their communications from the public and then withheld the documents. This is one of seven lawsuits that stem from a three-year-long legal battle with Andrews over a land dispute. 

In short, the governor and some of his staff willingly and knowingly violated the law. In doing so, they denied public access of government records to the public. Then they expect the taxpayers to pony up the funds to pay for a settlement. 

To add insult to injury, they send taxpayers the tab for the legal fees as well. 

All while the governor and staff admitted no culpability, received no punishment, shirked all accountability and personally paid nothing to defend or settle their wrongdoing. 

But wait, there’s more. 

Of the $700,000 settlement with Andrews, $445,000 will be paid out of funds from the Department of Environmental Protection. 

That’s right. The governor and state legislators, who insisted there wasn’t enough money to fund land acquisition under the implementation of Amendment 1, were able to find $445,000 toward settling a public records lawsuit. 

The rest of the public funds came from the governor’s office ($120,000), the attorney general’s office ($75,000) and the Department of State ($60,000). 

The Scott’s office, in this legal trouble for lack of transparency, sought legislative spending authority to conceal what the money would be used for. Instead of listing the purpose for the $120,000 as something like “legal settlement in the Steve Andrews’ case,” Scott’s office disguised it as a contract for “content-wide consequences.” No lesson learned there. 

We’re still not done. 

The settlement does not include legal fees. To date, some $165,000 has been spent — at taxpayers’ expense. 

Some went to a California legal firm hired to prevent Google from releasing information on private email accounts that the governor’s office denied existed. Scott lost that battle. 

This begs a few questions: 

Why are taxpayers footing the bill for actions taken by the governor against their interests? 

Why isn’t the governor required to cover his own legal expenses and settlements for public record violations? 

Why is the governor using private counsel at an additional cost when taxpayers are already funding in-house legal counsel in the governor’s office? 

Do the Sunshine Laws matter when officeholders blatantly ignore them with no punishment? 

In another public records dispute, St. Petersburg lawyer Matthew Weidner, government-in-the-sunshine advocates and some in the news media allege Scott and the Florida Cabinet violated the state’s open meeting laws when they ousted Commissioner Gerald Bailey of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement without any public discussion or vote. 

The cost to taxpayers — $55,000 to settle, $139,249 for Scott’s outside counsel and $225,000 in legal fees for the other three Cabinet officials. 

The public never got answers to how and why Bailey was forced out by Gov. Scott and what the Cabinet knew. 

These two settlements were the first time tax dollars were used to end public records cases against a sitting governor — prompting the First Amendment Foundation to point out correctly that no other governor has spent taxpayer money to resist government-in-the-sunshine. 

But the governor doesn’t limit all his legal wranglings to public record violations. During his first term in office he racked up millions in legal fees trying to defend several policies, including requiring a drug test for welfare recipients, tweaking state pension plans, cutting teachers’ pay and purging voters. 

The legal fees alone for his failed effort to continue his drug test requirement for welfare recipients cost Florida taxpayers over $1.5 million, but he didn’t have to pay. 

He’s not alone. The Legislature also passes its legal costs on to taxpayers. 

In an effort to thwart voters’ desire to stop gerrymandering and favoring one political party over another in the redistricting process, the Legislature conducted much of its map drawing in secret. 

The resulting lawsuits and legal challenges are ongoing but the bill so far is $11 million. That doesn’t include the costs of the failed special session on congressional redistricting nor the upcoming special session on state Senate redistricting. 

Something is terribly wrong when Florida taxpayers are being shortchanged by their elected officials and then handed hefty legal bills to defend those subverting their will and working against their interests. 

When elected officials don’t follow the laws, it shouldn’t be the taxpayers who bail them out.

“Exceptional results and proactive client service are the traits we look       for in partners, and OpenX delivers on both,” Conor Beck, Director of Ad       Operations at Townhall Media said. “The OpenX team has worked with us to       help deliver on our programmatic revenue targets. We’ve already exceeded       our programmatic goals by 50 percent primarily due to OpenX’s bidder       product."" 
 
Qasim Saifee, SVP of Monetization at OpenX, said, “We deployed OpenX       Bidder in the market a full 18 months before the competition. Working       with our publisher partners using bidder to maximize their ad revenue       for the last year and a half has given us a unique depth of experience       that allows us to deliver consistently better results than any other       tagless solution in the market.”

Kelly Gissendaner, 47, is to be put to death by injection at 7 p.m. EDT at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. 
 
The state's Board of Pardons and Paroles met Tuesday to decide whether its refusal earlier this year to commute Gissendaner's sentence to life in prison should stand. 
 
In their latest application to the board, the inmate's lawyers emphasized Gissendaner's model behavior in prison and remorse for her role in plotting her husband's murder in 1997. 
 
They also said her death sentence was inconsistent with her crime because she did not kill Douglas Gissendaner and was not present when he was stabbed to death. 
 
The man who carried out the kidnapping and murder, Kelly Gissendaner's then-boyfriend Gregory Owen, received a life sentence.

147783,b5372488-9ea2-4246-9d99-156f3e34a792,The Legality of Daily Fantasy Football Enters Controversy,Inquisitr,"Fantasy Football is well underway as the 2015 football season has begun. Anyone who’s tuned into a football game so far has surely noticed the pervasiveness of daily fantasy sports commercials from companies like Fan Duel and Draft Kings. But what exactly are daily fantasy sports, and why are they legal? After all, it sounds very similar to internet gambling, which is illegal in the United States. 
 
However, the NFL says they don’t consider fantasy games to be gambling, and the fantasy sports companies agree wholeheartedly. But now that fantasy football websites have promised payouts with real money, Congress has decided to take a closer look. 
 
It began with one congressman from New Jersey, who brought the legality of online sports platforms to the attention of the government. Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey sent a letter to the GOP Leaders of the House Energy Commerce Committee. He states in the letter that he would like to “hold a hearing examining the relationship between professional sports and fantasy sports to review the legal status of fantasy sports betting.” 
 
Pallone’s entire letter insinuates that the sport is illegal, discussing how some websites are now accepting fees and allotting prizes for their fantasy sports teams victories. The total prizes amount to more than a billion dollars in cash prizes. He also asserted that more than 57 million people from both the United States and Canada engage in fantasy sports, which means that if it turns out to be internet gambling after all, it could potentially be a widespread problem. 
 
There seems to be some kind of loophole that makes this awarding of prizes completely legal. The biggest thing that fantasy sports have in their favor is that it’s working on more of a prize basis than gambling. 
 
“I think it should be legal only because I don’t really see a problem with it,” Bruce Mclean, avid fantasy sports fan from Massachusetts told WWLP . “I don’t see who its hurting. To me it looks like people are gaining from it.” 
 
And he’s not the only one who has that opinion. Millions are pushing to keep this form of “sports betting” legal, despite Pallone’s complaints. 
 
It also fits under a specific loophole made in the 2006 law regarding sports betting. According to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, there is a specific exemption for Fantasy sports. 
 
Fantasy sports have created quite the enterprise. Not only do they benefit from advertising on channels like ESPN, but they’ve also bread professional sports handicappers. Millions use their services when determining the outcome of a game and the best picks for a certain game. Shutting down this industry would shut down millions of jobs and severely hurt the sports industry. 
 
It’s still unclear what Congress will decide to do about the current controversy that is Fantasy sports. They make take it to court, or they may forget about it altogether and Fantasy Football, and all its glory, will go on like nothing ever happened.

Here's how some online business leaders explain this controversial move. The answer starts off pretty simple; by providing consumers at an expense level no higher then $5 for each player on every TV show or website (for ""subsidized"" costs), big commercial groups decide not only whether people want access but also determine if those same ads get paid less quickly because viewers see fewer dollars invested instead.* It does however create restrictions upon advertisers going forward just yet — even though there wasn´T much concern about running such large advertising budgets while trying one up against giant networks whose audiences still didnI understand your points… I did!

IN BRIEF - NAFO closes seamounts to bottom fishing, fails to regulate Alphonsino fishery 
   
 CANADA 
Saturday, September 26, 2015 
  
The 37th Annual Meeting of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) concluded on September the 25th of 2015 in Halifax, Canada. Member countries agreed to several measures that will lead to improved ecosystem protection, but did not follow scientific advice provided over the past two years to close a number of deep-sea coral and sponge areas to bottom trawling or to regulate the fishery for alphonsino, a deep-sea species fished on the high seas of the northwest Atlantic. 

“This year, NAFO finally closed the seamount loophole,” says Susanna Fuller, Marine Conservation Coordinator at the Ecology Action Centre, and an official observer to NAFO. “NAFO closed seamounts to bottom trawl fishing in 2006, but the reality is that they all remained open to “exploratory” fishing. We’re very pleased that finally they have been actually closed to bottom fishing, period.” 

2016 will mark a decade since the United Nations General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution committing high seas fishing nations to close or otherwise prevent damage to sensitive deep-sea ecosystems from bottom trawling and requiring environmental impact assessments for all deep-sea fishing activities. The UN General Assembly has scheduled a review in the autumn of 2016 of the actions NAFO and individual high seas fishing nations have taken to implement the UN resolutions as well as a review the implementation of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement.

IN BRIEF - PNA calls to have observers on transhipments 
   
 FIJI 
Saturday, September 26, 2015 
  
NADI - The Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) has called on the Tuna Commission to include fisheries observers in all transhipments taking place in the high seas. 
 
The issue was highlighted this week at the Pacific Tuna Forum underway in Nadi, Fiji. 
 
Largely unmonitored, transshipping involves fishing vessels - longliners - transferring their catch to ‘motherships’. This means that boats can stay out at sea for  a longer period of time, evading checks on their fishing practices and licence conditions. 
 
PNA CEO, Dr Transform Aqorau told PACNEWS transhipment of purse seiners is well controlled but transhipment of longliners is a major problem that needs to be addressed in the region.

IN BRIEF - Maine lobster on the menu for Obama’s dinner with Chinese president 
   
 UNITED KINGDOM 
Saturday, September 26, 2015 
  
When President Obama sits down Friday 25th of September 2015 night for a state dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the second course will be a tribute to National Lobster Day – a portion of lobster poached in butter and served with leek rice noodle rolls. 
 
Lobster from Maine, of course. And labeled as such on the menu. 

The timing seems perfect, and it turns out there was some behind-the-scenes lobster boosterism going on. Maine’s independent Sen. Angus King put in a word for serving Maine lobster at the dinner because Sept. 25 2015 is the crustacean’s new national day of recognition. 
 
In August, King, Sen. Susan Collins and some of their New England colleagues persuaded the Senate to endorse a second national day of recognition for Maine’s No. 1 seafood export. The other national day is June 15. 
 
If the Chinese leader is anything like his countrymen and women, he is a fan of lobster, particularly Maine lobster. The Maine Lobster Marketing Collaborative’s data on lobster exports to China show phenomenal growth in the past six years.

Increased shrimp production is vital to the economy, Prof Martins Antekhai, has said. 
 
Antekhai of the Department of Fisheries, Lagos State University (LASU), said investors could explore investment opportunities in small, medium scale shrimp aquaculture to meet an anticipated shortfall in seafood supply. 
 
He said there’s a huge business opportunity in shrimp production to fill the growing supply-demand gap in the face of rapidly expanding demand. 
 
The shrimp production supply chain provides opportunities for small farmers, cultivating companies, input and feed providers, processors, transporters and marketers.

IN BRIEF - Victory for consumers in WWF's battle to defend MSC ecolabel 
   
 SWITZERLAND 
Saturday, September 26, 2015 
  
Gland - The Echebastar Indian Ocean tuna fishery will not be certified to the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) standard. Following an objection from WWF and an independent adjudication, the Independent Adjudicator has made his final ruling on the case, reiterating his initial finding that the scoring by the certifier could not be justified and requiring that the earlier recommendation for certification be withdrawn. This landmark decision highlights that current management of tuna in the Indian Ocean does not meet the MSC’s sustainability requirements. 

The MSC, beset for a number of years by poor certifier performance and the misapplication of its sustainability standard will benefit from the decision, which brings a new clarity to the standard. But the real victors are the consumers who rely on the eco-label to assure them that their purchases are from genuinely sustainable fisheries. 

“As a founder and public supporter of the MSC, WWF could not permit the credibility of the eco-label to be undermined by such a systematic misapplication of the certification requirements. Any process that results in a fishery that cannot control exploitation of its stocks being certified as sustainable simply can’t be supported by WWF and we needed to take action,” said Dr Wetjens Dimmlich, WWF’s Indian Ocean Tuna Programme Manager.

IN BRIEF - Sanford Progresses Value Add Strategy and Invests in Factory Trawler 
   
 NEW ZEALAND 
Saturday, September 26, 2015 
  
The increasing focus on adding more value to its quota portfolio has prompted Sanford to invest in a freezer trawler with superior capability and capacity as well as processing flexibility. The F/V Granit, a 67m vessel currently operating in Norway, is eminently well suited to New Zealand conditions and for Southern Ocean operations. 

Sanford’s Chief Executive Officer Volker Kuntzsch said “that the processing flexibility of the ‘F/V Granit’ will ensure greater productivity through fully utilizing the catch in line with specific customer demand. The vessel will enable us to diversify our product portfolio and make excellent use of revolutionary and innovative technology such as the Precision Seafood Harvesting project developed in New Zealand. This significant investment signals our continued commitment to the New Zealand seafood industry and its ongoing success”. 
 
The ‘Granit’ is expected to arrive in New Zealand in the third quarter of 2016.

Friday, September 25, 2015 
  
After months of heated debate and public outcry, the town board voted unanimously at its meeting Tuesday 22nd of September 2015 to adopt new legislation regarding aquaculture in Southold. 
 
The vote came after a lengthy public hearing on the draft code at Town Hall earlier this month, during which residents turned out in force last night to speak out on the issue of aquaculture — with some supporting fish farms and other land-based operations, and others adamant that they have no place near residential neighborhoods. 
 
Back in July 2015, the town board voted unanimously to defeat initial draft legislation regarding land-based aquaculture, with an eye toward implementing amendments that would help ease concerns raised by neighbors. 
 
The new draft includes a provision that such operations be sited on parcels that are a minimum of seven acres, with a 200 foot setback from other parcels and 100 feet from roads.

Manchester -  Lewis Mills & Co. , a leading seafood sourcing company announced on September the 23rd of 2015 they have achieved preferred vendor status from Nordic Halibut AS of Norway to market their farm raised whole fish in the United States.

The halibut is processed and packed for immediate delivery in Nordic Halibut's facility, reaching the U.S. market in a matter of hours. As a result, the halibut's shelf life is unprecedented compared to wild halibut that often spends days at sea before being delivered to market. 
 
Norwegian Atlantic halibut has a firm white meat with a mild flavor, which makes both the preparation and serving of the fish a true pleasure. The halibut is an excellent high protein source of Omega-3 fatty acids and fits the ""center of the plate"" profile for foodservice operators and retail supermarkets. Nordic Halibut offers consistent flavor, dependable delivery and fixed pricing 12 months a year.

Nordic Halibut AS is the leading breeder and farmer of sustainable Norwegian Atlantic farmed halibut. Nordic Halibut oversees the entire life cycle of the halibut - from egg to marketable fish. The halibut is processed and packed for immediate delivery in Nordic Halibut's facility, reaching the U.S. market in a matter of hours. As a result, the halibut's shelf life is unprecedented compared to wild halibut that often spends days at sea before being delivered to market. Norwegian Atlantic halibut has a firm white meat with a mild flavor, which makes both the preparation and serving of the fish a true pleasure. The halibut is an excellent high protein source of Omega-3 fatty acids and fits the ""center of the plate"" profile for foodservice operators and retail supermarkets. Nordic Halibut offers consistent flavor, dependable delivery and fixed pricing 12 months a year.

The program provides financial assistance to young adults as they move forward with their lives after cancer.

St. Louis, MO (PRWEB) September 24, 2015 

Forty-one college-bound childhood cancer survivors around the country have been awarded scholarships totaling $141,750 from The . The program provides financial assistance to young adults as they move forward with their lives after cancer. The scholarships help young adult survivors achieve their educational goals so they can pursue their personal and professional dreams.

For 20-year-old Neha Kundagrami, the scholarship means the difference between going to college stressed about loans and how she’ll pay for those after graduation, and going to college without worrying and being able to fully enjoy the experience. “My cancer treatment had taken a lot out of my family financially,” said the University of Maryland student. “I applied for around 25 scholarships that are given to cancer patients, and the NCCS was the only one that helped me out.” She added that college also helped her connect with other survivors her age, further enriching her college experience. 

September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness month, a fitting time for the students to receive the scholarships and a reminder to everyone who knows a child with cancer that their future is bright, and help is available for their journey.

Scholarship applicants must be childhood cancer survivors living in the United States, under the age of 25 and diagnosed before the age of 18. The program is open to all childhood cancer survivors who currently attend or plan to attend an institution of higher learning.

“We want every survivor to have the support and tools they need to thrive, and for many of them, college is a lifelong dream that we can help fulfill,” said Mark Stolze, president and CEO of the NCCS. “We are very proud of these young people for overcoming the challenge of cancer and pursing their dreams, and we are honored to help make that happen.”

In addition to financial help, the NCCS provides opportunities for recipients to connect and engage with one another. For example, the organization initiates a monthly topic via an email thread – such as study habits, the challenges of college life, and the benefits of volunteering – and students share their thoughts, encourage one another and help one other solve problems. The NCCS requires the students to do community service as a condition of their scholarship. Many of them participate in the organization’s mentoring program, where they serve as a friend and role model to a younger survivor, providing encouragement to the child during and after treatment.

“The scholarship program provides a community that not only brings young adult survivors together but also gives the NCCS a better understanding of how we can support them,” said Pam Gabris, Beyond the Cure coordinator for the NCCS. 

What’s extremely encouraging, added Gabris, is that most of the scholarship recipients are studying for careers that will allow them to help children with cancer, in fields such as medicine, education and psychology. 

To date, the scholarship program has awarded more than $650,000 in scholarship money to childhood cancer survivors throughout the country. The NCCS is extremely grateful to the Englehardt Family Foundation, the Energizer Charitable Trust and the BNSF Railway for their generous support of the program. This year’s scholarship winners span the country and will attend a diverse group of schools in the 2015-2016 academic year. They are:

The study was conducted at the CRO's dedicated Influenza Challenge Research facility in Costa Mesa, CA. Between January and March 2015 , WCCT was able to successfully recruit over 400 volunteers, all of which had not received an influenza vaccine within the past two years, to participate in the study evaluating immunity to the H1N1 influenza virus.

WCCT Global's Influenza Challenge Research facility was an integral to the success of this study. The facility is a Controlled Quarantine Environment with 30 private rooms and air ventilation ducts preventing cross-ventilation or exposure. The facility is also capable of harvesting and preserving PBMCs for future research. Currently, WCCT Global's facility is the only commercial facility in the United States capable of conducting an influenza clinical study of this kind. Furthermore, the CRO owns the only Challenge Virus A/ California /2009 (H1N1) in the United States . 

WCCT's infectious disease specialist and principal investigator, Bonnie Bock , M.D., comments on the findings of the influenza clinical study: ""This study demonstrates that up to 30% of the general population lacks immunity to H1N1. This is a population that would be at risk for an H1N1 pandemic, but would also be eligible for inclusion in our influenza challenge research studies. Despite widespread recommendations for all individuals to receive a yearly influenza vaccine, there are those who choose not to receive it and are therefore more susceptible to illness and complications, which raises a concern for public health."" 

When asked about this study's contribution to the field of vaccine research, Mel Affrime , WCCT Global's Sr. Vice President of Translational Medicine had this to say: ""Our influenza challenge research studies will continue to collect data that ultimately leads to the development of newer vaccines and therapeutics. We are eager to continue our research in this field and look forward to discovering more about the influenza virus and other infectious diseases.""

265471,91628018-7e61-40e2-9406-52f4b79c701d,Ridley Scott gets back to his sci-fi roots with ‘The Martian’,Waynepost,"British director Ridley Scott has worked in pretty much every movie genre except Westerns. There have been, among others, historical pieces (“The Duellists,” “1492: Conquest of Paradise”), thrillers (“Black Rain,” “Hannibal”), a fantasy (“Legend”) and a comedy (“Matchstick Men”). But a large chunk of Scott’s fans are always waiting for him to return to what he’s best known for: science fiction, having made “Alien,” “Blade Runner,” “Prometheus” and that very cool “1984”-style TV ad for the Apple Macintosh computer in 1984. In “The Martian,” based on Andy Weir’s 2011 novel about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the NASA folks trying to rescue him, Scott spends most of the film on the Red Planet, but he keeps the story flowing with plenty of drama happening on Earth and on a ship heading home. Scott spoke about the film and his career at the Toronto International Film Festival. Q: Is there something about setting a film in space that allows you to tell more truths about life on our own planet? A: No. I think the fantasy of space, which is also now a reality, is a marvelous platform for almost anything goes. And when you do anything goes, whether it’s a play or a book or a film, you’ve got to make your own set of rules, and stick within the confines of the rules that you make. So if I’m doing space fantasy, whether it’s “Alien” or “Prometheus,” I’ve got to draw up the sidelines of my rulebook. And within that it’s still a fantasy, because it’s never really going to happen. This film is a lot easier, because you can lean very heavily on the science in the novel, and the way the characters are, the way the NASA people are, the way the JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) people are. So to me this was a much more realistic movie. Q: Could you share your thoughts on the science fiction genre? A: The big daddy of science fiction really was Stanley Kubrick. I remember sitting down in this big theater in London in 1968, watching a 70-millimeter version of the newly released “2001” at 2 in the afternoon. There was no one else in the room, which was shocking to me. Because to me that was then the threshold regarding what we do as theater. Film is theater, really. And it made me think, “OK, now I want to do a science fiction movie.” Never forget Stanley. Stanley was very much in cahoots and in competition with NASA. He was concerned that they were going to beat him to the moon before he could get out his bloody movie. So he was using [NASA] designer Ralph McQuarrie, who was designing NASA’s suits and the interiors of their ships. He was styling them, and Stanley took all that styling. That definitely influenced George Lucas in “Star Wars.” And my “Alien” was definitely affected by Stanley. So it’s all gone down the line. Page 2 of 2 - Q: It’s interesting that “The Martian” isn’t just about the Matt Damon character. The film has lots of different stories going on. A: I had four universes revolving: Matt on his own on Mars, JPL, the spaceship and NASA. They were the four quadrants, and I knew if I got slow somewhere, I could always cut to somewhere else. But we never got slow. That’s why I think the film has got a great engine. Q: You have quite a résumé of films. Do you ever look back at your career and think about how far you’ve come? A: I started off as a director when there was no film school. I was a designer who one day, for some bizarre reason, was given a script by the BBC and told, “OK, you’re on in three weeks. You’re going to direct that.” I was given an office with a middle-aged war horse of a production assistant who had been through every conceivable evolution of making everything. So I sat down with her and with two [casting] books. One was male spotlight and the other was female spotlight. I’d say, “Is he any good?” She’d say, “Nah.” I’d say, “Is she any good?” She’d say, “Yeah.” So that’s how I cast my first TV show, and I was on live with six cameras. From that I got into traditional rehearsals, where you’d have an old church hall or a factory marked out with sets on the ground in tape, with a chair, a table, and a glass of water, and all of that. I know there’s a moment where you can over-rehearse, and kill the evolution, kill the natural instinct of the actor. If you cast it right, then let ’em free. And I always shoot the first rehearsal. The actors know they’re on. I’ve got four cameras on, and there’s a natural intuition – a little bit of chemistry, a little bit of fear – and invariably, you get one or two great takes.

Ed Symkus covers movies for More Content Now.",855,"NASA folks trying to rescue him, Scott spends most of the film on the Red Planet, but he keeps the story flowing with plenty of drama happening on Earth and on a ship heading home. Scott spoke about the film and his career at the Toronto International Film Festival. Q: Is there something about setting a film in space that allows you to tell more truths about life on our own planet? A: No. I think the fantasy of space, which is also now a reality, is a marvelous platform for almost anything goes. And when you do anything goes, whether it’s a play or a book or a film, you’ve got to make your own set of rules, and stick within the confines of the rules that you make. So if I’m doing space fantasy, whether it’s “Alien” or “Prometheus,” I’ve got to draw up the sidelines of my rulebook. And within that it’s still a fantasy, because it’s never really going to happen. This film is a lot easier, because you can lean very heavily on the science in the novel, and the way the characters are, the way the NASA people are, the way the JPL (Jet Propulsion Lab) people are. So to me this was a much more realistic movie. Q: Could you share your thoughts on the science fiction genre? A: The big daddy of science fiction really was Stanley Kubrick. I remember sitting down in this big theater in London in 1968, watching a 70-millimeter version of the newly released “2001” at 2 in the afternoon. There was no one else in the room, which was shocking to me. Because to me that was then the threshold regarding what we do as theater. Film is theater, really. And it made me think, “OK, now I want to do a science fiction movie.” Never forget Stanley. Stanley was very much in cahoots and in competition with NASA. He was concerned that they were going to beat him to the moon before he could get out his bloody movie. So he was using [NASA] designer Ralph McQuarrie, who was designing NASA’s suits and the interiors of their ships. He was styling them, and Stanley took all that styling. That definitely influenced George Lucas in “Star Wars.” And my “Alien” was definitely affected by Stanley. So it’s all gone down the line. Page 2 of 2 - Q: It’s interesting that “The Martian” isn’t just about the Matt Damon character. The film has lots of different stories going on. A: I had four universes revolving: Matt on his own on Mars, JPL, the spaceship and NASA. They were the four quadrants, and I knew if I got slow somewhere, I could always cut to somewhere else. But we never got slow. That’s why I think the film has got a great engine. Q: You have quite a résumé of films. Do you ever look back at your career and think about how far you’ve come? A: I started off as a director when there was no film school. I was a designer who one day, for some bizarre reason, was given a script by the BBC and told, “OK, you’re on in three weeks. You’re going to direct that.” I was given an office with a middle-aged war horse of a production assistant who had been through every conceivable evolution of making everything. So I sat down with her and with two [casting] books. One was male spotlight and the other was female spotlight. I’d say, “Is he any good?” She’d say, “Nah.” I’d say, “Is she any good?” She’d say, “Yeah.” So that’s how I cast my first TV show, and I was on live with six cameras.

The effort hasn't matched Scott's cast in every case. Narrators have required sleep and hard work to meld the best of Scottís story design with that of the filmmaker. (""I mean, when I"," first human explorers up there with his two daughters being given instructions from their leader; Russell Crowe's ""Catch Me If You Can"" is actually narrated by David McKechnieůle or Sean Condon who also does great action scenes as well - not coincidentally because I mean Chris Evans' role here plays out just like this.)
In my view—as it so often happens when we meet directors everywhere at these screenings —the success stories take place within one cinema series rather than some set structure defined only strictly through film history....When you put together multiple films inspired primarily mainly directly from literature--in more traditional American works such either Stephen King�ian work but adapted domestically into adaptations involving movies---this becomes especially difficult if those books were originally shot over hundreds nor thousands square feet...For too long filmmakers've allowed themselves all sorts  of space before finally finding something they wanted where everyone else could easily get better stuff due diligence.""

Yesterday's media briefing by Arsne reinforced the good news; Francis Coquelin won't feature today, may not on Tuesday but has a chance of making a return against United next weekend.Arsenal travel to Leicester and face the only remaining unbeaten side in the Premier League. Which doesn't say much for the early season form of the top sides. Looking at their fixture list, it isn't any surprise they have yet to taste defeat; it's hardly been the most taxing of starts for Claudio Ranieri as their new boss.In stark contrast to the absence of any relationship with the current Chelsea manager, Wenger looked forward to renewing acquaintances with the Italian. Ranieri expressed surprise ' almost disappointment ' that Arsenal haven't won the title since 2004. Join the club, Claudio, join the club.Wenger's admiration for his opponent succeeded in riling Mourinho, the claim that Ranieri had laid the foundation for the success the Portuguese enjoyed in his first Chelsea reign sent him into apoplexy. Driven by jealousy of Wenger's job security, Mourinho ranted and raved seeming to provoke himself into a siege mentality over Diego Costa's ban, Gabriel's ban being rescinded before capping it off with the lunacy over perceived favouritism from referees. It was bizarre and probably the reaction Wenger hoped for.Vaguely on that subject and I did mention his name in the last paragraph, Gabriel received a one-match ban having admitted a charge of improper conduct. There is some bizarre logic flying around, trying to justify why he shouldn't have been charged even though the one man you would expect to defend him to the hilt, Wenger, chose to justify why he should. He misses today and probably more with Per Mertesacker's return to fitness.One player who will start is Alexis, desperately looking for form and goals. Arsne knew it would be a difficult season for the Chilean so in his infinite wisdom decided to play him before he was fully fit. Yesterday, he admitted that this is a fundamental reason for the player's inconsistency, citing also Chile's Copa America win as a motivational issue.Sanchez wouldn't have taken much (any') persuading to be in the squad for the opening day of the season but his performance then reflected his lack of fitness and practice. It would be interesting to know how many of the successful international side have seen their form suffer. Maybe they have, maybe they haven't; it makes Wenger's decision to rush him back all the stranger with the Premier League being an unforgiving environment in which to have problems. It's a damning indictment that the squad couldn't cope without him for the first couple of games. We couldn't cope with him in the side on the opening day either.Having had a good dbut season, Alexis has had something of a 'free pass' so far. Had any other player shown the same form, it's fair to say that they would have been subjected to greater scrutiny, shall we call it. Arsne pointed out that given the number of chances he has had, Alexis might reasonably have expected to have scored half-a-dozen goals by now. That Arsenal's leading scorers each have a brace tells you that he isn't the only player misfiring. By far the most noticeable but not the only one.It's a problem which I am sure will soon be rectified. Perhaps even today, on the ground where he scored his first Premier League goal in last season's corresponding fixture. That match, the third in that campaign, underlined Arsenal's inconsistency. Six games in and the club had a total of ten points, the same as this season. Arsenal need to find their form quickly to take advantage of rivals whose starts have been even more laboured. There are only two games before the international break and six points would put a different complexion on the season.Wholesale changes from Wednesday are expected today with the only question being whether Arteta or Flamini replaces Coquelin. The latter might feel that he earned the chance with his brace of goals on Wednesday and I understand that. He won't get it or it will be a major surprise if he does even though his style of play releases Cazorla from defensive duties. Wenger is nothing but loyal to Arteta though and I think will remain so today.It means a line-up (Arsne's selection) of:Cech; Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini (Arteta), Cazorla; Ramsey, zil, Sanchez; Walcott.

The 6ft 8in (2.03m) South African looked jaded and it was clear that his historic win over world No 2 Andy Murray, less than 48 hours earlier had resulted in too much wear and tear on his body and mind by the time he signed off with a third-set bagel. 
 
The fifth-seeded Swiss, a two-time Grand Slam winner, ended the match after just 107 minutes. 
 
The third set was a 6-0 rout, lasting 25 minutes with Anderson winning just five points. Overall, Anderson committed 42 unforced errors as he imploded on the big stage. 
 
The 15th-seeded Anderson was attempting to become the first South African to reach the semi-finals in New York since Johan Kriek in 1980. He was also looking to secure a second win over a world top tenner in the same tournament for the first time. 
 
Coming into the match, the Johannesburg-born Anderson defeated Wawrinka in their last four meetings at the Indian Wells, Canada and Paris Masters last year and at Queen's this year. 
 
Because of the threat of rain on Wednesday night, their match was moved to the Louis Armstrong Stadium from Arthur Ashe Stadium. 
 
The move favoured Anderson because he had defeated Murray there earlier in the week and his game seemed to thrive on the faster surface. 
 
However, Anderson said afterwards that he had a learnt a few lessons from the encounter. “It was really tough out there, [I] was maybe a little bit nervous just with the occasion and a lot of waiting around [and] switching courts,” said Anderson. 
 
“I wasn't really making too many inroads on his serve,” he admitted. [It] just obviously wasn't meant to be today, I have got to take what I can. “This week has been a great week for me- there [are] a lot of positives. I definitely know I can do better than I did today. “My goal is always to give myself opportunities. I was able to capitalise on one of them, [a] big one, getting to the quarters in this event. 
 
“That's definitely something I can take with me. I want to put myself in this position again - today I didn't feel like I gave myself the best shot of maybe going a little bit further.” 
 
With this win, Wawrinka has qualified for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals for the third year in a row, and a semi-final clash against compatriot Roger Federer on Friday. - African News Agency (ANA)

THE slowdown in the Chinese economy and its recent currency, has sent Africa to whom it has been a key trading partner, reeling. 
 
Amidst the jitters, attention has now focused back on the hitherto little-spoken-about fact that European Union countries, led by France and the UK, are overwhelmingly the largest investors in Africa, not China. 
 
The US is also significant, and even South Africa invests more in the continent than China does. 
 
READ: China’s investment in Africa isn’t what you think, and it’s not mostly with ‘rogue’ states 
 
Despite its own economic difficulties, this South Africa role as a key FDI source for the rest of the continent is likely to become more critical in the years ahead. 
 
However, clear successes in other African countries, South African companies for some time had a troubled past finding a footing in some key continental economies – most surprisingly of all,  Kenya. This was among the issues highlighted at the Kenya Trade & Investment Summit held in South Africa’s commercial heartland, Sandton, in Johannesburg. 
 
Ground shifts 
 
High expectations and vigorous investments did not always pay off, pushing South African companies to continually innovate and find news ways of penetrating this potentially lucrative market. 
 
The ground has shifted lately, though. The June 2015 launch of Game, Massmart’s retail brand, coincided with the confirmation of a deal between Choppies, a successful retailer from Botswana, to take over Kenya’s Ukwala stores. 
 
The interest in retail matches South Africa’s most critical investments across Africa in the last five years, which have included telecommunications, manufacturing, and mining. Because of its strategic location, the Kenyan market offers a gateway to the lucrative 140 million-strong East African Community market. 
 
New investors in the Kenyan market are trying hard to avoid the fate that befell South African brewing giant SABMiller. In 1998, the company opened a production unit for its Castle brand in Kenya. The Kenyan market had, since the 1920s, been the near-monopoly of East African Breweries Ltd. The entry of a much bigger brewer sparked of what came to be famously known as the “beer wars”. 
 
SABMiller eventually threw in the towel, as its rival played on the patriotism of Kenyans, leading to the sale of Castle to EABL in exchange for distribution rights in Tanzania. In 2011, SABMiller announced its return by buying Crown Foods and increasing the distribution networks of its Tanzanian brands into Kenya. 
 
Its new “softer” strategy has become the telling mark of the second wave of South African investors in the Kenyan market — those who are much more adept to local sensitivities. 
 
The first modern wave of South African investments began after the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1994 with the end of apartheid and the election of Nelson Mandela as the countries’ first democratic president. 
 
There had been a 29-year break, during which early investors such as Old Mutual survived in a market that was unfavourable to South African companies and investments. 
 
With SABMiller’s initial misstep, followed by Nando’s and other brands, South African companies’ interest in the Kenyan market dipped somewhat. Other players who  failed to gain traction in the market include iWayAfrica and Africa Online, both owned by Telkom. Barclays, now owned by ABSA Bank, also reduced its presence in Kenya as locally-owned banks grew, while retailer Woolworths sold several of its stores to Kenyan retail giant Nakumatt. 
 
The favourite model 
 
In 2005, South African investment giant Sanlam bought Pan Africa Life, becoming the first SA-owned Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed company. Most companies now prefer to use that model: buying existing ventures instead of starting up from scratch, although Game’s entry is a greenfield investment. 
 
Massmart had tried to buy family-owned Naivas supermarkets before making the decision to go it alone. In the brewing industry, 26% of Kenya Wines and Alcohol Limited was sold to Distell Group in 2013.  MTN Business acquired UUNet Kenya while Altech increased its share in Kenya Data Networks, both internet firms. Naspers has a ubiquitous presence with Multichoice Africa’s brands DSTV and GoTV. 
 
Greenfield players 
In manufacturing, Tiger Brands currently has a 51% stake in Haco industries and also bought Rafiki Mills and Magic Oven Bakeries. In banking, Old Mutual, which has been in Kenya for more than a century, launched an aggressive acquisition campaign where it acquired, among others, the hugely successful Kenyan microlender Faulu Kenya. 
 
Stanbic Bank bought CFC Bank, giving birth to the CFC Stanbic Holding and Liberty Kenya Holdings. 
 
There are still companies using the greenfield investment strategy. In Kenya’s lucrative real estate sector, property services provider Broll entered the market in 2013. 
 
Seafood diner Ocean Basket also opened an outlet to take advantage of Kenya’s growing middle class consumer culture. The American brand Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) made its entry into Kenya through South African franchise holder Simon Schaffer. Other franchises such as Mr Price, Steers, and Debonairs Pizza have had mixed success in the Kenyan market. 
 
Trade deficit 
The trade deficit between South Africa and Kenya stood at $33-million at the resumption of relations in 1992 and has since grown more than tenfold. Kenyan companies tend to show less hunger for investments outside their immediate East African region, while South Africa has been aggressively investing across the continent as its home market becomes saturated. 
 
This partly explains why, while there are over 60 successful South African companies in Kenya, there are very few Kenyan companies in South Africa. 
 
ARM Cement set up its South African subsidiary in September 2004. The arm has a capacity of 30,000 tonnes per year, half of which the main plants in Kenya produce. Olympia Capital, the NSE listed investment holding company, has struggled to make headway in South Africa. Its two subsidiaries, Plush Products Ltd and Natwood Limited, were liquidated in 2009. 
 
Plush Products was a manufacturer of blinds and window decorating accessories while Natwood made wooden lifestyle products. Their successor, Tiespro Trading, was closed in 2013. The company made bathroom and kitchen fittings. Kenyan juggernauts such as Safaricom, Kenya Commercial Bank, and Nakumatt have yet to show interest or capacity to invest beyond East Africa. 
 
According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, South Africa ranks second for favourability in sub-Saharan Africa, after Mauritius. Kenya ranks 15th. The ranking is of little consequence to Kenyan companies and exporters who have found it difficult to penetrate the South African market. 
 
Apartheid legacy 
 
According to the 2014 Economic Survey, South Africa exported KES70.7billion worth of goods to Kenya while the latter only managed KES3.277billion in 2013. The problem, it has seemed, is that South Africa is yet to dismantle the high tariff barriers it instituted during the apartheid era. 
 
This is particularly true for countries like Kenya outside South Africa’s key trading blocs. Tea, Kenya’s most successful export to the world, attracts a four-rands-per-kg tariff to access the South African market. Soda ash attracts a 12% levy, making the market prohibitively expensive for Kenyan exporters. 
 
The battle to access the South African market has however accelerated this year, with diplomatic tiffs over visa regulations and trade agreements sparking a flurry of bilateral activity to resolve them. 
 
Right now, South Africa’s huge market remains tantalisingly out of reach for Kenyan exporters and investors. Kenya’s market, on the other hand, is still a working experiment for South African companies and a solid market for exporters.",1278,"by France and the UK, are overwhelmingly the largest investors in Africa, not China.

It all started out so innocently: a two-bite-sized, 100 percent all-beef patty topped with chopped onions and a pickle. It sold for just 5-cents, a tiny burger that was so easy to eat; its inventors  dubbed it the ""slider."" And if you've ever had the pleasure of eating a sack of White Castle hot from the steamer, you know what we're talking about. 

Although White Castle may not be at the top of the fast-food food chain today, fellow hamburger makers owe it supreme gratitude. After all, the fast-food hamburger began with the Wichita, Kansas-based company, which is often credited as the first chapter of a multi-billion-dollar industry — and what is now feeds huge swaths of America. 

Much of the chain's early success came thanks to promotional marketing initiatives. Through the 1940's, restaurants would periodically print coupons offering five burgers for 10-cents. Now, after 90 years and over a few billion burgers sold, White Castle operates more than 100 restaurants in a number of cities throughout the Midwest including Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Louisville, Minneapolis, and St. Louis. 

But Florida? None. 

Alas, most Floridians probably don't remember White Castle once had two Miami locations in the late 1960's, but the company closed its Florida operations in 1967 due to inefficient supply distribution. Which means only a handful of nostalgic old-timers — or Midwest transplants — are familiar with these steamed, meaty gems of beefy goodness. 
  
South Florida can get a taste of White Castle ""sliders"" at Magic City Casino on November 17.

""Most people thought they'd never be back, but those folks are about to eat their words,"" Burger Beast's Sef Gonzalez  said in a recent post . ""But here we are, 50 years later, and White Castle's Crave Mobile will be gracing us with its presence at the Welcome Back To Miami White Castle Party [next month]."" 

In November, White Castle's Crave Mobile truck will be arriving in South Florida for the special edition food truck round-up  on Tuesday, November 17 from 5 - 10 p.m. at Miami's Magic City Casino, followed by appearances at Homestead-Miami Speedway for the Ford-Ecoboost series November 20-22 . Gonzalez says that the the people at White Castle contacted him about participating in any of the famed Burger Beast events and the blogger and burger maven jumped at the chance, forming a food truck roundup around the famed sliders. Though plans are still in the works, expect live music and a full roster of trucks, including  Ms. Cheezious, Jersey Dawgs, HipPops, and El Rey de las Fritas.  

Previously, the Crave Truck made its debut in 2014 with an inaugural road tour, logging more than 20,000 miles on a national road trip that made a number of stops in Florida, including fair grounds and theme parks in Orlando, Tampa, and Kissimmee. 

""Since its launch two years ago, the Crave Mobile has been wildly popular among cravers in areas without a White Castle restaurant,"" said White Castle vice president Jamie Richardson in a press release. 

Throughout the year, cravers (AKA fans of White Castle) can track the Crave Mobile truck by following White Castle on Twitter. The Crave Mobile truck is also available for private rentals including corporate functions, weddings, and birthday parties. 

In the meantime, South Floridians can quell their White Castle cravings by the sack during the Welcome Back To Miami White Castle Party taking place from 5 to 10 p.m. on Tuesday, November 17 at Magic City Casino located at 450 NW 7th Street in Miami.

White Castle generates nearly 30 percent of the nation's food stocks — around $37 billion a year on average — and endures in the top 50 retail stores around the world for less than 20 years.

There’s one episode left and despite that, the show remained as glacially paced as ever. Basically, each storyline inched forward a bit to a place where, in the finale, maybe things will finally happen. Or maybe they won’t. 
 
Here’s the gist of episode five, titled “Cobalt.” Travis tagged along with some soldiers and forgot about the atrocity he saw last week. Madison sat at a coffee table. Nick met a mysterious salesman (who was the best part of the episode, by the way). Alicia and Chris played dress-up, then smash siblings. And Ofelia brought her soldier boyfriend home to Daniel for him to torture for information on their plans. You know, typical LA stuff. 
 
Through that torture, Daniel found out that all the soldiers are planning on leaving the next morning and giving “humane terminations” to everyone they’ve captured. Since Madison’s son Nick is still there (and, they think, Daniel’s wife Griselda, but she met the business end of a Anton Chigurh gun), this is a bad thing. What’s worse though is this idea in general. 
  
   
If you think about it, much of what the soldiers are doing is kind of working. Things are relatively safe in the fences. People are living their lives. The way the show has presented this situation over the last two episodes, you get the sense that things could actually be good if the soldiers would simply keep everyone in the loop. But they don’t, solely because it makes for good paranoia. 
 
We found out in this episode the soldiers have plenty they’re not sharing. They’ve killed a lot of zombies and, in fact, know quite a bit about them, too. Dr. Exner knows everyone turns—not just those who are bitten—and that trauma to the head kills them. They also know there are thousands upon thousands out there. This is a big, big issue, not something that’s going to be easily fixed. And yet they choose to keep everyone in the dark about it. 
 
So if are the soldiers rounding up sick people and keeping them isolated, why not explain the reasons to the people? “Hey, I know I just busted into your house and kidnapped your son, but we just want to make sure he’s not going to die and turn into a zombie, because that’s how this global outbreak—yes, it’s a bigger problem than you expected—works. We’ll have him back soon.” 
 

 
The only reason for keeping everyone in the dark is because they’re scared the truth will drive them crazy. That may be true on some other Walking Dead spinoff somewhere, but very little we’ve seen in these five episodes leads me to believe these characters would react badly to the news. I think they’d embrace it and adapt. However, the show that I’m watching isn’t really aware of that. It’s almost like the characters are existing independent of the larger plot. 
 
The whole turn of events makes very little sense to me. Sure it makes for good drama, but after the strong focus on the military actions in the previous episode, to basically say “They’re all leaving tomorrow” in this episode feels very sudden. You made a decision that this is the route you wanted this show to go in. Stick with it. Almost immediately abandoning the idea is just another example of how, I feel, Fear the Walking Dead has no idea what it wants to be.",577,"smash siblings.

Inspired by the shapes of flowers, leaves and fruits, the people weave beautiful patterns. Model present Atlas silk in the Taklimakan Desert in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region Atlas is a traditional type of Xinjiang silk that means “graceful” in Uyghur language. It is a kind of silk fabric with fine intricate patterns that Uygur women like very much, and is renowned for its multiple and resplendent colors. Usually the colors include sharp contrasts such as viridis, sapphire, indigo, yellow, peach, orange, gold, mauve, black, white, etc. The patterns are well-knit and lifelike, representing the light and color of nature. Atlas silk is soft, flexible, beautiful in patterns and excellent in quality. It is used by the local people not only for costuming but also as an interior ornament. Drawing Silk The first step is drawing silk. The cocoons have to be sorted out first and the dirty and abnormal-shaped cocoons have to be boiled in water for about 15 minutes until the cocoons change to green color and are soaked with water. Then a stick is used to stir the cocoons and twist the fiber threads of the raw silk into strands. Normally, 25-30 threads make one strand. Coloring the silk Once the silk has been extracted it can be tied and dyed using a tie-dye or dye-resist process. It means plastic bags are used to bundle the threads up before coloring each part. Based on the design requirement, different patterns are made by staining lightly or deeply. Different colors are made by bundling up different parts each time and dipping into different colored dyestuffs. To get the multi-coloured patterns the silk may be dyed one colour at a time. The traditional Atlas silk has four basic shades: black, red, yellow and multi-color. Minerals like alum, indigo and natural plant extracts like walnut skin, jujube skin, and tamarisk are used to make dyestuffs. Tying the silk The silk is secured to a wooden frame and then tied up according to traditional patterns. Once the threads are placed into patterns the thread is loaded onto the machines for the weaving to be done. Weaving In accordance with the designed patterns, workers start weaving on top of the basic colors. Normally, a handmade Atlas silk is 6.45 meters long and 0.45 meters wide. The traditional weaving method requires workers using their hands and feet at the same time and one person can produce 3-4 meters long silk per day. Known for its softness, lightness, and bright colored patterns, Atlas silk is made through a complicated process and is extremely popular among Uygur women in Xinjiang. Nowadays, the traditional silk garment has been fused with modern design and is becoming more fashionable. by Xiao Xiao xiaoxiao@interactchina.com

Magnesium! Kid stuck a pea up her nose? Magnesium! Ha. I jest. But really in my mind there are few things that can’t be helped with some extra magnesium. If you’ve been reading my blog for long, you’re well aware of my magnesium obsession. No shortage of posts about its many uses and virtues around here: The Dead Sea contains vastly more magnesium chloride than any other body of water on our planet Magnesium for Pregnancy and Beyond Preventing Morning Sickness Preventing Preterm Labor Baby Shower Basket Essentials Gift Ideas for the Pregnant Woman You Love Happy Sleep Restoring Balance and Fertility Magnesium for Tics and Tourette Syndrome 5 Tips for Managing Anxiety Natural Solutions for PMS Magnesium for Healthier Moms and Babies Soothe Your Life with Magnesium So, in brief… As a result of depleted soils, processing of refined grains, diets low in magnesium-rich foods, and high consumption of magnesium-depleting substances (sugar, caffeine, alcohol, birth control pills, antacids, antibiotics, and soft drinks) many people are not getting sufficient magnesium through dietary means. Even taking oral supplements is often not enough to restore adequate magnesium stores. Many people’s bodies do not absorb magnesium supplements very well through the digestive tract. Magnesium deficiencies can be remedied far more quickly using topical magnesium. It can take six months to a year for individuals with magnesium deficiencies to restore intracellular magnesium to ideal levels with oral supplementation alone. But Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., a neurosurgeon and world-renowned pain management expert, has found that skin application of magnesium oil (25% magnesium chloride concentration) can restore intracellular levels within just four to six weeks (see Carolyn Dean, M.D., N.D., The Magnesium Miracle, p. 248). If you experience any (or many) of the following symptoms, you may benefit from boosting your magnesium levels: Anxiety and panic attacks
Headaches and migraines
Abnormal bowel function, constipation, etc.
High blood pressure
Eczema
Muscle pain, cramps, and spasms
Depression
Kidney disease and kidney stones
Recurrent miscarriages and premature labor
Premenstrual syndrome
Menstrual cramping and bloating
Pregnancy leg cramps
Pre-eclampsia
Morning sickness I often recommend epsom salt baths as a good way for people to boost their magnesium levels. Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate, a cheap and easy-to-find magnesium source. But magnesium chloride (as found in sea water) is the ideal form of magnesium for the body to utilize. I have been using magnesium chloride topically (bath salts, liquid, cream) for over five years now. And I have seen many benefits in my own health as I have used it. Lately magnesium is my go-to for weird pregnancy aches and pains, leg and foot cramps, nausea, braxton-hicks contractions, round ligament pain, ankle swelling, headaches, etc. As a preventative measure, I rub magnesium oil on my belly or back pretty much every day. About a year and a half ago I started using and sharing magnesium chloride sourced from the Dead Sea, packaged and distributed by the company Mg12. While magnesium is the primary component, these products actually contain 21+ vital trace minerals in an ionic form, the form most easily recognized by the body. Mg12 has kindly been giving my readers a 10% discount on their products (with coupon code “birthfaith”) ever since. In gratitude for my efforts in helping to promote their products they sent me a lovely package this week full of oodles of Mg12 products. Perfect timing ’cause we were running low on magnesium bath crystals. I thought I’d pay their generosity forward and give away some of the cool stuff they sent. Lots of cool stuff (but, sorry, I’m keeping the bath crystals). ;-) I am giving away three prizes. I will cover shipping for anyone within the United States. Winners outside of the U.S. will need to cover their own shipping costs (sorry!).

48231,8e8218c3-04a5-4366-9864-0399e40fc71a,"At Rally, Bernie Sanders Draws Line Between Respecting Police And Condemning Racist Brutality",ThinkProgress,"MANASSAS, VIRGINIA — Mostly white faces made up the crowd of about 2,000 who attended a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Virginia on Tuesday night. One of them was Kai, a 21 year old who held up a sign reading “Black Lives Matter” for nearly the entire event, which lasted about an hour and a half. 
 
“This is one of the most important causes of our generation,” he told ThinkProgress during the rally when asked about why he was holding the Black Lives Matter sign. “I want people to know that their lives matter to me.” 
 
As Sanders surges in Democratic primary polls, he’s also been criticized for his handling of modern racial justice issues. At the beginning of his campaign, Vox pointed out that the U.S. senator from Vermont avoided talking about race directly, “answering questions about racial issues by pivoting back to economic ones.” Sanders was also obviously frustrated when he was interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists this summer, and many bristled when his campaign responded by chanting “ We stand together ” in response. “Think about it,” Darlena Cunha wrote following the event for Time. “It involves hundreds of mostly white people shouting what is essentially “All lives matter” at the black people who dare to attempt to be heard.” 
 
Since then, Sanders has been upping his rhetoric on racial issues, seemingly attempting to show non-white progressives that he is their candidate, too. At his speech at Monday’s rally, he tried to bridge the gap between the need for police and the need for racial justice — which he called a “difficult issue, a sensitive issue, a painful issue.” 
 
From his remarks: 
 
Racism is alive and well in America. And I’m not just talking about that very, very sick person in Charleston, South Carolina a couple months ago who walked into a bible prayer session, prayed with people in the room, and — because they were black — he took out a gun and killed 9 of them. 
 
I’m not just talking about the hundreds of groups in this country whose sole purpose for existence is to propagate hatred.  […] 
 
I am also talking about institutional racism. About people like Sandra Bland, and Michael Brown. I am talking about unarmed African Americans killed while in police custody. 
 
His mentions of Bland, a black woman who died mysteriously while in police custody, and Brown, an unarmed black man who was shot by a white officer, drew emotional cries of praise from the crowd. However, Sanders was also quick to defend police, recounting his time as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, where he frequent dealt with the force. 
 
“The vast majority of police officers in this country are honest,” he said. 
 
“If anybody thinks that being a cop today is an easy job, you are sorely mistaken,” he continued, noting that many are underpaid and undertrained. “But let us also be clear, that like any other public official, that when a police officer breaks the law, he must be held accountable.” 
 
His solutions, like many he touched on in his wide-ranging speech, were broad. He proposed ending “the heavily militarization” of local police forces, abolishing privately-owned prisons, and integrating police to become closer with the areas they serve — both personally and aesthetically. “We need to make our police officers look like the diversity of the community,” he said, touching on the number of heavily white police forces that serve in majority minority communities. 
 
Still, the end of his message on racial justice was as Sanders-esque as it could be — economic to the core. Finally, he proposed an end to the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted people of color . 
 
“A young person can get a criminal record for smoking marijuana,” he said,” “but the CEOs on wall street have never been prosecuted!”

673925,a144fcf3-acb4-472b-b130-1859bc0aee1b,Arsenal have given Wenger the Freedom to Fail – Adam Kemp,Just Arsenal News,"Adam Kemp – Arsene, I know many things that you don’t know – or that you ignore! Arsene Wenger irritably shielded his judgement to start David Ospina over Petr Cech in Arsenal’s ‘shock’ defeat at home to Olympiakos, which has risked their hopes of qualification to the last 16, stating it would be a “farce” to blame the culpable Columbian. I mean the goalkeeper only came for a routine cross and somehow managed to fumble the ball into his own net. I am sure Petr Cech needed to be rested due to all the running he had done in the previous match, getting up and down that pitch, taking its toll on the dynamic box to box goalkeeper! Yeah, right! Arsene Wenger’s arrogance and complacency is what has killed Arsenal’s chances of progression to the knockout stages. I said it five years ago, and I’ll say it again, Wenger Out! I think it is unanimous that the fans are frustrated at the clear lack of progression from a so called big club. Arsenal are now in an exceptional financial position with increased turnover, increased profits, cash reserves quotes in excess of £200 million and limited borrowing. According to Forbes, Arsenal are valued in excess of £1 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable football teams. So with this financial muscle and a manager with a solid early track record, why is the club still clearly a level behind the elite trio of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich? The blame is firmly down to the manager and he is given the freedom to fail. Say what you will about Jose Mourinho, but his most recent comments are spot on! Arsene Wenger will always be due respect for the way he revolutionised the English game. Between 1998 and 2006, the team played exceptional football. His previous teams were so good, you pretty much knew if you played teams with the calibre of Zagreb and Olympiakos, nothing but a win was on the cards. Nowadays Arsenal fans look at these games with a sense of hope that the team will turn up. As when Arsenal turn up we win these games. When Arsenal have an off day we have it is us to implode and make plenty of errors. The Olympiakos and Zagreb games are no one off. Cast your eyes back to West Ham at home, Aston Villa at home, Bradford away and Monaco at home; as but a few examples of losing to opposition ‘on paper’ we should comfortably beat. But then Arsenal can go away to Bayern Munich and win, go away to Manchester City and Manchester United and win! This cyclical inconsistency is somewhat tormenting for our fans. Arsenal seem to be able to play well when there is less pressure or little to play for. They crumble when the going gets tough and have no real leaders on the pitch. What is frustrating is that arguably they now have several world class players: Sanchez, Ozil, Cech, Cazorla and Koscielny are arguably at the elite level. The club also has technically gifted players in the mold of Ramsey, Wilshere, Walcott and Giroud to name but a few. They have a great squad with some exceptional youth players to come through in the coming seasons. Individually the players are all great players, but the problem is the similarities in their qualities. Arsenal in my opinion are possibly two to three players away from having the complete team. I would argue another centre back with the same quality as Koscielny, another ball winning midfielder to complement the outstanding Coquelin and a truly world class striker. I know there aren’t too many players out there better than Giroud and Walcott in that position, who are realistically available. But rest assured there are players out there who could improve the spine of this team! The problem is the manager has no conviction on who to buy. He flatters to assert himself in the transfer market and feels that he cannot pay over the odds for the quality of the player. Simply having Joel Campbell still in the team shows how flawed our transfer policy is! When Arsene decides to retire, due to his untouchable status with the board, the new manager coming in has the resources to take Arsenal back to their previous level. What is so frustrating is that you would hope the stubbornness of the current boss, could be altered in his final years to give something back to the fans. He is fast becoming a ‘farce’ in his own right. He is incredibly deluded and season after season we see the same mistakes resurfacing, over and over again. How on earth the manager could not find one single outfield player in the summer transfer window, is just incomprehensible. We are set for another season where we a likely to face an earlier exit from the Champions League, probably scrape into the top four and may have a decent cup run. This home defeat to Olympiakos will have far greater ramifications for the season. With Bayern Munich coming to the Emirates next there is no room for error, and no room for rotation. Quite why Petr Cech has yet to play for Arsenal in the Champions League is baffling, but resting this world class goalkeeper for the first two group games has spectacularly failed.

276320,4ed85209-e64c-4f68-a294-4f33b642ef44,Terrelle Pryor tough act to follow after Braxton Miller,Cleveland.com,"BEREA, Ohio -- Browns coach Mike Pettine couldn't help but notice converted Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller's devastating spin move, sideline tiptoeing, soft hands and multiple touchdowns against the Hokies Monday night. 
 
Was it foreshadowing for his own converted Buckeye QB Terrelle Pryor? 
 
""I had it on in the background while I was working, caught some of it,'' said Pettine. ""Saw more highlights than anything else.'' 
 
But Pettine wasn't about to predict the same sensational debut for Pryor, who missed most of preseason with a strained hamstring and made the team without catching a pass. In fact, the Browns are in 'show me' mode with their newest receiver, who earned a spot by a leap of faith . 
 
""Terrelle is here because he showed that promise and that potential, but once you make the 53 that you have to be a productive member of the team,'' he said. ""It's hard to just have that be a project for a year. We're  looking for the returns on that investment to be sooner than later. 
 
""He's shown that he's capable of it, but for him, it's about being consistent, knowing what to do, being available from a physical standpoint and then going out there and executing. He's going to get every opportunity in practice to do that."" 
 
Miller, who caught a 54-yard TD pass and spun his way to a 53-yard TD run, set the bar high for former Ohio State quarterbacks playing receiver, but Pryor is confident he also has what it takes. 
 
""I really think at the end of the day, an athlete's going to be an athlete -- period,'' he said. ""So if you're athletic and you're an athlete, with the right coaching, which I have --  I have great coaches in this building, great teammates -- you should be able to convert and convert pretty easy. 
 
""Obviously, there's little nuances, different things you've got to learn. But I'm an athlete. I hold myself to the highest standard, and I'm sure the coaches do as well. So that's all I'm trying to do is get better every day and work on my craft."" 
 
That's not to say Pryor was inspired by Miller's performance. 
 
""It was good to see him do it, but I don't really look to the next man,'' said Pryor, who's currently fourth on the depth chart. ""I really focus on myself, focus on my health and my craft. It shows you how versatile he is, though, absolutely.' 
 
""I think he's phenomenal. He came in well as a receiver and he did a little bit more stuff out of the backfield, just some quarterback stuff. He looked pretty versatile and electric. He's a Buckeye. That's what Buckeyes do, man.'' 
 
Can he put a spin move on a defender like Miller did midway through his 53-yard TD run? 
 
This is an NFL type move right here from Braxton Miller. https://t.co/7ayaykP5Bh 
— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) September 8, 2015  
""No, I cannot move sideways like that,'' Pryor said. ""Straight ahead, make one move, go straight ahead I can do."" 
 
Pryor, who runs in the 4.4s, also cautioned that the NFL is a whole different ballgame. 
 
""I just look to make plays and try to get the ball in my hand,'' he said.  ""Obviously it's the NFL level, so it's more gameplanning and people understand that and know who's on the field at all times.'' 
 
So will it be a bigger challenge for him than it was for Miller against the unranked Hokies? 
 
""I don't know, you're going to have to ask Braxton when he comes here next year,'' Pryor said with a laugh. 
 
Pryor was back home in Jeannette, Pa. on Saturday with his one-year-old son when he found out he made the 53-man roster. He was on the bubble heading in, and had no idea how it would go. 
 
""It's a blessing for the coaching staff, coach Pett and (wide receivers coach) Joker (Phillips) and (general manager) Ray Farmer and the line up to the top of the front office to give me the opportunity and I won't let them down,'' he said. "" I can't even say (I worried). I just believe in what the coaches believe, so I'm just going to prove them right.'' 
 
During the preseason finale in Chicago, Pryor was a jack-of-all-trades, taking two Wildcat snaps and running for 5 and 4 yards, serving as the personal punt protector and lining up at receiver, where he blocked aggressively downfield. 
 
""It was fun just doing little different things, being versatile,'' said Pryor. ""It's always good to switch it up and give defenses different problems. It was a great. I haven't been in a game situation. 
 
""It was unfortunate that I didn't get to play in a lot of preseason games. Once that happens, once I touch the ball, and (they) see what I do with the ball, things change. So we'll see once I start playing.'' 
 
Pryor -- who changed from No. 87 to No. 17 -- isn't even sure if that will be Sunday against the Jets. He's listed fourth behind Brian Hartline, Travis Benjamin and Dwayne Bowe -- and it's yet to be determined if he'll be active. 
 
 ""I don't really look into that,'' he said. ""I look at it as I'm coming off injury, and when I get back on the field and I start getting in the groove with the guys, anything can happen.'' 
 
Even though he was still struggling with the hamstring in Chicago, he made an impact every rep, whether it was blocking or running. 

""I know to give myself a chance to even make the team, I had to go show something,''  he said. ""I was in a little pain, but it's something I had to do. Anytime I get on the field, I want to make some type of play to change the game. 
 
""I go hard and I work my butt off. So I think my mentality is just like a killer instinct. Whoever's in front of me, I try to embarrass him. I try to do whatever I possibly can to beat that guy and don't let him stop me. That's just how my mindset is and how it always will be."" 

Whether he's lining up at receiver, quarterback, tight end, punt protector or wherever they decide to put him, he'll embrace the role. 

 ""You've got to do that to help the team until you prove yourself,'' he said. ""Some of the best receivers that I did research on, some of the guys did the same stuff as I'm doing, playing special teams and doing stuff, and then eventually they got to where they're at and they didn't have to do it. I still got a lot of stuff I've got to prove. I have plays I've got to make.'' 
 
Pryor said he switched to No. 17 because he likes lower numbers and not because he hasn't abandoned his quarterback dreams. 
 
  ""No, I didn't think about it,'' he said. ""17 was the lowest (he could get). But I don't really look too far into numbers. It's going to be the player to make it.'' 
 
Pryor said he never felt a backlash from teammates who supported departed receivers like Josh Lenz, who worked hard and produced all summer. 

""I have great teammates,'' he said. ""They're welcoming, and I can't really speak on the situation with that touchy subject, however you want to call it. It really has nothing to do with me. It's not going to change where I'm at right now. It's not going to change where they're at. I just look forward to getting on the practice field with my teammates and trying to get better."" 
  
Pryor acknowledged that if he gets on the field Sunday, he'll have to oppose some of the top cornerbacks in the business in Darrelle Revis, Antonio Cromartie and former Brown Buster Skrine. 
 
""Joe Haden, Tramon Williams, I don't think it really gets that much better than those two guys, especially Joe,'' said Pryor. ""I go against those guys every day. Today I probably had like 15-20 reps against Joe. 
 
""I think the magnitude of his athletic ability and his prowess as a corner, he's just a phenomenal athlete and a phenomenal cornerback. So working with him and getting some good work with him, when I'm ready, I'll be ready for anybody I feel like."" 
 
Even though he's got a tough act to follow.",1405,"in 'show me' mode with their newest receiver, who earned a spot by a leap of faith . ""Terrelle is here because he showed that promise and that potential, but once you make the 53 that you have to be a productive member of the team,'' he said. ""It's hard to just have that be a project for a year. We're looking for the returns on that investment to be sooner than later. ""He's shown that he's capable of it, but for him, it's about being consistent, knowing what to do, being available from a physical standpoint and then going out there and executing. He's going to get every opportunity in practice to do that."" Miller, who caught a 54-yard TD pass and spun his way to a 53-yard TD run, set the bar high for former Ohio State quarterbacks playing receiver, but Pryor is confident he also has what it takes. ""I really think at the end of the day, an athlete's going to be an athlete -- period,'' he said. ""So if you're athletic and you're an athlete, with the right coaching, which I have -- I have great coaches in this building, great teammates -- you should be able to convert and convert pretty easy. ""Obviously, there's little nuances, different things you've got to learn. But I'm an athlete. I hold myself to the highest standard, and I'm sure the coaches do as well. So that's all I'm trying to do is get better every day and work on my craft."" That's not to say Pryor was inspired by Miller's performance. ""It was good to see him do it, but I don't really look to the next man,'' said Pryor, who's currently fourth on the depth chart. ""I really focus on myself, focus on my health and my craft. It shows you how versatile he is, though, absolutely.' ""I think he's phenomenal. He came in well as a receiver and he did a little bit more stuff out of the backfield, just some quarterback stuff. He looked pretty versatile and electric. He's a Buckeye. That's what Buckeyes do, man.'' Can he put a spin move on a defender like Miller did midway through his 53-yard TD run? This is an NFL type move right here from Braxton Miller. https://t.co/7ayaykP5Bh — NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) September 8, 2015 ""No, I cannot move sideways like that,'' Pryor said. ""Straight ahead, make one move, go straight ahead I can do."" Pryor, who runs in the 4.4s, also cautioned that the NFL is a whole different ballgame. ""I just look to make plays and try to get the ball in my hand,'' he said. ""Obviously it's the NFL level, so it's more gameplanning and people understand that and know who's on the field at all times.'' So will it be a bigger challenge for him than it was for Miller against the unranked Hokies? ""I don't know, you're going to have to ask Braxton when he comes here next year,'' Pryor said with a laugh. Pryor was back home in Jeannette, Pa. on Saturday with his one-year-old son when he found out he made the 53-man roster. He was on the bubble heading in, and had no idea how it would go. ""It's a blessing for the coaching staff, coach Pett and (wide receivers coach) Joker (Phillips) and (general manager) Ray Farmer and the line up to the top of the front office to give me the opportunity and I won't let them down,'' he said. "" I can't even say (I worried). I just believe in what the coaches believe, so I'm just going to prove them right.'' During the preseason finale in Chicago, Pryor was a jack-of-all-trades, taking two Wildcat snaps and running for 5 and 4 yards, serving as the personal punt protector and lining up at receiver, where he blocked aggressively downfield. ""It was fun just doing little different things, being versatile,'' said Pryor. ""It's always good to switch it up and give defenses different problems. It was a great. I haven't been in a game situation. ""It was unfortunate that I didn't get to play in a lot of preseason games. Once that happens, once I touch the ball, and (they) see what I do with the ball, things change. So we'll see once I start playing.'' Pryor -- who changed from No. 87 to No. 17 -- isn't even sure if that will be Sunday against the Jets. He's listed fourth behind Brian Hartline, Travis Benjamin and Dwayne Bowe -- and it's yet to be determined if he'll be active. ""I don't really look into that,'' he said. ""I look at it as I'm coming off injury, and when I get back on the field and I start getting in the groove with the guys, anything can happen.'' Even though he was still struggling with the hamstring in Chicago, he made an impact every rep, whether it was blocking or running. ""I know to give myself a chance to even make the team, I had to go show something,'' he said. ""I was in a little pain, but it's something I had to do. Anytime I get on the field, I want to make some type of play to change the game. ""I go hard and I work my butt off. So I think my mentality is just like a killer instinct. Whoever's in front of me, I try to embarrass him. I try to do whatever I possibly can to beat that guy and don't let him stop me. That's just how my mindset is and how it always will be."" Whether he's lining up at receiver, quarterback, tight end, punt protector or wherever they decide to put him, he'll embrace the role. ""You've got to do that to help the team until you prove yourself,'' he said. ""Some of the best receivers that I did research on, some of the guys did the same stuff as I'm doing, playing special teams and doing stuff, and then eventually they got to where they're at and they didn't have to do it. I still got a lot of stuff I've got to prove. I have plays I've got to make.'' Pryor said he switched to No. 17 because he likes lower numbers and not because he hasn't abandoned his quarterback dreams. ""No, I didn't think about it,'' he said. ""17 was the lowest (he could get). But I don't really look too far into numbers. It's going to be the player to make it.'' Pryor said he never felt a backlash from teammates who supported departed receivers like Josh Lenz, who worked hard and produced all summer. ""I have great teammates,'' he said. ""They're welcoming, and I can't really speak on the situation with that touchy subject, however you want to call it. It really has nothing to do with me. It's not going to change where I'm at right now. It's not going to change where they're at. I just look forward to getting on the practice field with my teammates and trying to get better.""

284599,a0ee14a9-6eb0-4982-97fc-e839ae6dab69,Strong showing for Red Bull in Singapore,Melbourne Age,"Red Bull youngster Daniil Kvyat recorded the fastest time in Friday's practice for the Singapore Grand Prix, and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was second, indicating those teams are set to provide a challenge to previously dominant Mercedes this weekend.

Red Bull had not topped the timesheets for any Formula One session this season but the performance level was confirmed by Kvyat's teammate Australia's Daniel Ricciardo, who was third fastest.

Runaway championship leader Lewis Hamilton, who has taken pole position in 11 of 12 races this season, was in an unfamiliar fourth place - though only three tenths of a second off Kvyat's time - and his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg was seventh.

Conditions at the Marina Bay street circuit aid Mercedes' challengers, with Ferrari operating well in hot track conditions as evidenced by its wins in Malaysia and Hungary, and the nimble Red Bull thriving through the many low-speed corners.

The 21-year-old Kvyat has not qualified higher than fifth in his two seasons in F1 while Ricciardo has never taken pole position in his career despite boasting three grand prix wins, so a breakthrough could beckon in Saturday's qualifying.

Their strong practice performance came against the background of more off-track drama for the team, which is in the midst of a messy divorce from its engine supplier Renault.

Raikkonen outperformed his Ferrari teammate Sebastian Vettel - who was fifth fastest - and continued the strong one-lap performance that saw him qualifying second in the previous race in Italy.

McLaren's Fernando Alonso also put in an eye-catching performance, clocking the eighth-best time, less than a second off the top of the charts. That was a marked improvement for the team, which has had a frustrating year as new engine supplier Honda plays catch-up in its return to the sport.

American driver Alexander Rossi, who will make his F1 race debut on Sunday for the Manor team, provided the major incident of the two 90-minute sessions, colliding heavily with a barrier at the left-hand turn under a grandstand, and snapping off both right-side wheels.

Rossi climbed out of the car unaided and appeared unhurt. The subsequent red flag ended the first session three minutes short.

Sanford concluded that building its own high-speed network would be more affordable and offer greater security than leasing capacity or using someone else's private network, said Brian Schuster, Sanford's director of information technology. 

""We certainly did evaluate our options and we had a number of options available to us,"" he said. 

After 10 to 13 years, Sanford's investment will have been paid back, and owning its own network will save money over the long term, Schuster said. 

""We have to think in terms of decades,"" he said, noting the new medical center is expected to last for decades. 

Because of the need to send enormous data files for medical scan images, Sanford requires a high-speed network linking its campuses downtown, on South University Drive and in the southwest, he said. 

""Doctors and radiologists and folks who need this data might be at any one of those locations,"" Schuster added. 

The network will have a bandwidth speed of 40 gigabits per second. ""That's some of the best you can get these days,"" he said. ""The demands for both telecommunications bandwidth and reliability are about as high as you'll find in any industry."" 

To install the network, which is being constructed by MVM Contracting, Sanford had to get a permit from the city of Fargo for a ""right of occupancy"" to lease right of way. It calls for a yearly fee of $1 per foot. 

Sanford's new data network will be a nine-mile loop, and will connect to an existing network of eight miles, Schuster said. 

The fiber cable has the capacity for higher speeds. In the future, Sanford will be able to upgrade the network by updating hardware connected to the fiber, he said. 

""It's the equipment at either end that has to be upgraded,"" Schuster said.

471228,4347fbe3-fdd1-4b1b-977a-ee2fa07858c3,Four Australians on drug smuggling charges granted bail in Hong Kong court,ABC Online,"A Melbourne pensioner, a brain-damaged Western Australian mine worker and two other Australians who all claim they were duped into smuggling millions of dollars in drugs bound for Australia have been granted bail in a landmark Hong Kong court ruling. 

The Australians, aged between 49 and 82, are among nine Westerners whose cases were uncovered by the ABC's 7.30 program earlier this year and who have been locked up in Hong Kong for as long as 15 months on drug smuggling charges that could see them imprisoned for the rest of their lives. 

All nine alleged drug smugglers claim to have been lured by a West African crime syndicate which grooms vulnerable people online into taking an all-expenses-paid trip to Hong Kong on the lure of a financial deal, a romance, an inheritance or a humanitarian project. 

Once in Hong Kong, victims claim they were handed luggage to take to Australia which they did not know contained the drug ice, hidden in the lining or in items inside. 

Along with a tenth courier, the group of unlikely drug smugglers were caught at Hong Kong airport with a total of $36 million worth of the drug ice, weighing 29.5 kilograms, as they set off for Australia and New Zealand between April 2014 and March 2015. 
   
The fact that in every single instance it involved ice, I hate to think of the harm and damage it would have caused to the young in Australia [and] New Zealand. 
 
      Judge Kevin Zervos   
Scores of others targeted by such syndicates have been arrested in Australia and in countries where they face the death penalty, including China and Malaysia. 

Many of them are frail, elderly, brain-damaged, mentally ill or juvenile. 

Last month 7.30 revealed the Australian Government and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had made a series of high-level representations to China this year, troubled by the evidence the Australians detained there were duped or coerced into smuggling drugs. 

In the Hong Kong High Court this afternoon, bail was granted to eight of the nine co-accused, including four Australians: 49-year-old WA mine worker Kent Walsh, who suffered serious brain injuries in a car crash six years ago; Darwin warehouse worker James Clifford, 62; Melbourne woman Suong Thu Luu, 44; and 82-year-old Melbourne pensioner Joerg Ulitzka, an Australian resident and a German citizen. 

Also granted bail were Americans Bove Celia Gertrude Eberhard, 67, William Leon Moorman, 47, and Mark William Un, 55, as well as Brendan John Toner, 62, from the UK. 

Prosecutors did not oppose bail for any of the nine except for Dutchman Hendrikus Jakobus Teutscher, 75, who will face a bail hearing tomorrow. 

Judge Kevin Zervos, from Australia, said each of the accused had been caught with a significant quantity of drugs, including Australian Kent Walsh. 

""I understand [Walsh was caught with] 3 kilograms of ice, which really highlights that it's a very serious problem for Australia,"" he said. 

""The fact that in every single instance it involved ice, I hate to think of the harm and damage it would have caused to the young in Australia [and] New Zealand."" 

The group's high-profile international defence barrister, Gerard McCoy QC, told 7.30 the ruling set a precedent in Hong Kong, where many other accused drug smugglers claim to be the victims of scams. 
Australian Federal Police called into question 
In court, Dr McCoy questioned what role the Australian Federal Police (AFP) had played in the group's arrests. 

He revealed one of the Australians, James Clifford, had been warned by the AFP he may be the victim of a scam before he left Brisbane Airport for Hong Kong late last year. 

""The [Hong Kong] Customs in each case knew the individuals were coming to Hong Kong,"" he said. 

""We need to know what overseas organisations were involved, if this is not a one-off cynical drug trafficking but a wider case. In reference, Mr Clifford was spoken to by AFP and a Queensland constable. 

""How was it the AFP knew not to stop him? The awareness of the AFP goes way back in time, way before he decided to leave."" 

The court has previously heard Hong Kong Customs and Excise had been tipped off about all nine accused drug smugglers by overseas authorities. 

The drug mules are due to be released from jail later today. They have been ordered to report to police once a week and are barred from leaving Hong Kong. 

They face a maximum penalty of life in jail. 

Judge Zervos is yet to put his reasons for the bail ruling on the record. 
The NYC socialite caught up in a drug scam 
The cases gained momentum after one of the world's oldest and most well-connected drug mules, 83-year-old New York socialite Elizabeth Kummerfeld, had her drug smuggling charges dropped in Hong Kong in April . 

Ms Kummerfeld, the widow of former New York deputy mayor and News America president Donald Kummerfeld, was jailed for a year after being caught at Hong Kong airport en route to Australia with 2 kilograms of ice in the lining of a backpack. 

Her charges were dropped when an investigation by Hong Kong Customs found she was a victim of a West African drug scam. 

Ms Kummerfeld, who is legally blind, had already lost her vast life savings to Nigerian email scammers posing as fundraisers for humanitarian projects. 

In an elaborate email con, she was convinced by a man posing as a Nigerian banker to travel from New York to Hong Kong and onto Australia to collect and deliver what she was told would be contracts for a multi-million-dollar compensation payment, but was instead handed a backpack lined with drugs in Hong Kong. 
Wave of drug courier arrests in Australia 
In Australia, 40 people have been arrested in the past two years after allegedly being targeted by such syndicates. 

Two-thirds of those couriers, whose cases have been finalised in the Australian courts, were cleared of any wrongdoing. 
  
The AFP issued a warning to be aware of similar scams after the arrest of 91-year-old retired dentist Victor Twartz , who was detained at Sydney Airport in July with 4.5 kilograms of cocaine in his luggage. 

Several Australians in jail for drug smuggling in China also claim to be the victims of scams, including former Adelaide jockey Anthony Bannister, intellectually disabled Brisbane man Ibrahim Jalloh, and Bengali Sherriff. 

In June, 7.30 revealed that disability pensioner John Warwick died in a Chinese prison hospital last year , where he was detained on suspicion of smuggling drugs after being lured to the city of Guangzhou by online scammers. 

This year alone, Australia has made 11 representations to China on behalf of nine Australians facing the death penalty there on drugs charges. 

In Malaysia, Australian grandmother Maria Elvira Pinto Esposto was arrested at Kuala Lumpur Airport en route from China to Melbourne with more than a kilogram of ice last year. 

She claims to be the victim of a romance scam.",1159,"have been lured by a West African crime syndicate which grooms vulnerable people online into taking an all-expenses-paid trip to Hong Kong on the lure of a financial deal, a romance, an inheritance or a humanitarian project. Once in Hong Kong, victims claim they were handed luggage to take to Australia which they did not know contained the drug ice, hidden in the lining or in items inside. Along with a tenth courier, the group of unlikely drug smugglers were caught at Hong Kong airport with a total of $36 million worth of the drug ice, weighing 29.5 kilograms, as they set off for Australia and New Zealand between April 2014 and March 2015.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To explore the effect of surgical treatment of pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum. METHODS A retrospective summary and analysis of 32 cases of patients of pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum who received surgical treatment during March 2010 to June 2014 in our hospital was performed. The effect of sigmoid sinus diverticulum back surgery was evaluated. RESULTS Among 32 patients, 29 caseswere female aged 30-62 years old, 3 caseswere male aged 32-47 years old. The lesion of 4 cases was on the left side, and 28 cases on the right side. High resolution CT scan of temporal bone was performed preoperativelyand all 32 patientshave different degrees of sigmoid sinus diverticulum.Preoperative comprehensive check had ruled out ear infections and tumors, history of ear surgery or trauma, other diseases such as hypertension, thyroid disease, and diabetes.All patients had no postoperative complications such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, cerebrospinal fluid leakage. One patient had low-key tinnitus caused by hemotympanum for a short timeand his symptoms disappeared after symptomatic treatment. After surgery, tinnitus of 7 cases were significantly reduced, tinnitus of 24 patients were disappeared. After follow up for 6-36 months, pulsatile tinnitus of 32 cases were completely disappeared, without recurrence.

METHODS A retrospective summary and analysis of 32 cases of patients of pulsatile tinnitus caused by sigmoid sinus diverticulum who received surgical treatment during March 2010 to June 2014 in our hospital was performed. The patients (TABs UTRB 01 or UDRAD 09) cell line was characterized by angiographic and ocular degeneration and marked cytoplasmic expression of DLP2. Several studies have shown that endoscopic use enhances minor coagulation to the median joint population of primary tinnitus targeted mainly by markers including 3-OH uV of four different types and 7", results were compared with 2 studies where a single radiologic presentation after surgery for recurrent recurring (CRI) repetitive otitis media lesions or secondary infection at 30 days postoperative have been used as models model design analyses [24]. RESULTS As expected if each patient treated all time on condition 4 through 28 when no imaging data could be obtained from previous visit - it is possible that further resection might improve diagnostic quality but then this would only occur one session longer than normal before reversion rate may increase significantly following an additional 3 sessions per day exposure/session type adjustment procedure which should result primarily pain associated disease risk reduction measures including cognitive functioning such use vs passive avoidance behavior rather common features among acute symptomatic infections also being measured are better outcome predictability using simple physical examinations because they always give greater precision information about outcomes less related side effects >10% chance score <20%) This study suggests two distinct mechanisms whereby these chronic inflammation induced changes cannot readily explain why some specific conditions do not change rapidly while others continue their

I think I speak for everyone when I say stress is vile. It's a horrible feeling, like you're overwhelmed and going to explode. It makes you feel ill and experience a range of emotions from laughing about how ridiculous it is to how angry you are about it.
Everyone is stressed about something almost everyday. It could be because of people who stress you out, or money problems or an issue with your job. It's such an issue that people might have to take time off work or go onto medication because it's causing so many issues! I feel like it's getting out of hand, like the world is too pressurised and multiplying it's own problems by 50.
Why can't we have a system throughout the world like in Star Trek The Next Generation, where no-one has money on Earth and jobs are something you enjoy and want to do, instead of doing something to just pay the bills. Imagine how happy everyone would be, sure we'd have to deal with hostile species from other planets and Starships etc but no money haha. Ok, I might be slightly delusion but that's me.
I also think that people need to learn how to cope with being stressed and try and avoid it. I realise that that sounds quite difficult but it could work. I can't talk really because I'm not good at being stressed, it tends to get on top of me until I lash out and be horrible to people. I also keep it to myself and all bottled up which is probably bad for my health.

The Impact (11-11-6) improved to 3-0-2 since Mauro Biello replaced Frank Klopas as head coach. 

David Accam scored for the last-place Fire (7-17-6), who lost their fourth in a row despite a coaching change this week that saw Brian Bliss replace Canadian Frank Yallop. 

Montreal went down a man for a third straight game after Laurent Ciman was shown his second yellow card of the game in the 90th minute. 

He will be suspended for a home game Saturday against D.C. United, as will Romero, who got a yellow card for taking his shirt off after the winning goal. 

The Fire did a tidy job of containing Drogba for most of the first half, but in the 39th minute, Nigel Reo-Coker swung wide on the right side and put in a cross. The former Chelsea star looked to throw down defender Jeff Larentowicz as he lunged forward to head it in but there was no call on his fifth goal in as many MLS games. 

The Fire missed two glittering chances in the first half, as Montreal goalkeeper Evan Bush just got a hand on the ball with Gilberto in alone in the 16th minute and Accam missed the net with a clear shot from just inside the area in the 33rd. 

Chicago equalized in the 50th when defender Victor Cabrera was beaten on a long ball by Gilberto, whose shot was tipped up by Bush and Accam nodded it in from the doorstep. 

Accam missed a chance at a go-ahead goal when he ran the Impact defence ragged but then chipped his shot over the bar. 

Impact captain Patrice Bernier, celebrating his 36th birthday, was serenaded by the fans as he sat on the bench, but he got into his first game since Aug. 5 in the 62nd minute and, 12 minutes later, slid a pass behind the defence for Romero to go in alone and score in the 76th. 

With Marco Donaldel (suspension) and Calum Mallace (foot injury) out, Reo-Coker and Kyle Bekker moved into the defensive midfield positions. Dilly Duka, who scored in a 3-0 win Saturday over New England, started in place of Romero, who came on in the 72nd minute. 

Impact designated player Ignacio Piatti missed the game to attend to a family matter, which put Dominic Oduro into the starting 11.

224961,d609e450-9a03-4200-bf2d-af1766f87698,Brazil tourism boost as Juliana Paes and Totalmente Demais stars film in Australia,Merimbula News,"Brazilian TV actress dubbed one of the sexiest people on the planet set to boost Australian tourism. 

TAKE ONE: Juliana Paes – Brazilian actress, TV presenter, Playboy magazine cover girl and once declared by People magazine to be one of the 100 sexiest people on the planet – signs on to play Carolina, the ""seductive tyrant editor-in-chief"" of Totalmente Demais, the fictional magazine that is also the title of Brazil's new telenovela.

TAKE TWO: Telenovela king Fabio Assuncao, winner of the 2009 Best Actor award at the Brazilian Film Festival also agrees to star in the series produced by Globo, Brazil's largest TV broadcaster.

CUE AUSTRALIA: These telenovelas are guaranteed massive audiences in Brazil.

What better way of promoting Australia as a tourist destination to Brazilians than by persuading the producers to set key scenes of Totalmente Demais in carefully selected locations around NSW and Queensland?

Which is why Paes and Assuncao are here this week in Australia, filming in Sydney and the Whitsundays as part of a $US1 million partnership with Tourism Australia, Destination NSW and Tourism and Events Queensland.

In Totalmente Demais (the Brazilian equivalent of ""simply the best""), Paes plays the beautiful but ruthless editor relaunching a style magazine, which involves fashion shoots in Australia.

Key locations include classic Sydney settings such as Bondi Beach, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Sydney Opera House, Hotel Intercontinental and Quay restaurant, plus Queensland's Bait Reef, Hamilton Island and Whitehaven Beach.

Australia appears in four episodes of Totalmente Demais, and there will be lots of spin-off publicity during the six months it is being broadcast since five of Brazil's top newspapers and magazines are also here covering the filming.

Why Brazil? And why would a publicly funded body like Tourism Australia invest in a telenovela?

""This is really about getting Brand Australia seen by as many eyeballs as we can,"" explains John O'Sullivan, Tourism Australia's managing director.

""Our arrivals from Brazil over the past 12 months are up by 19 per cent. Brazil is a fast emerging market. There is a growing middle class that has high disposable income, they want to travel, and they are beginning to discover Australia. So it is a market we want to build on over the next five years.

""And this type of telenovela will reach around 22 million viewers per minute. Some 156 million Brazilians admit to watching one of Globo's telenovelas. That's 78 per cent of the nation's population. For us, this is all about building our brand and our presence in Brazil.

""We have identified Brazil – along with the United States and China – as one of three markets we are focusing on in the premium travel sector. Our target is to get a 10 per cent increase in luxury travel out of those three markets over the next 12 months.""

Globo produces several telenovelas a year, each one screening for six days a week for six months.

While the locations obviously have to fit the plot, the three Australian tourism bodies had a say in which parts of Australia figure in the show. For example, the director asked for suggestions about where to film a bar scene. Opera Bar, with its views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, suited everyone.

It's hardly the first time Tourism Australia has invested in foreign TV shows or films as a way of seducing would-be tourists.

Two episodes of Running Man, a South Korean adventure challenge series, were shot in the Gold Coast and Melbourne in 2013 and were aired in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia as well as Korea. Korean visitors to Australia rose by 8 per cent in the year ended July 2015. Coincidence?

Australian-born, Britain-based chef John Torode is now in discussions with Tourism Australia and UKTV about a second series of John Torode's Australia. The first series – filmed in NSW, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia – was so successful it was repeated several times on UKTV's Good Food Channel.

Likewise, American chef Eric Ripert recently filmed six episodes of his Avec Eric In Australia TV series on the Cooking Channel, which have been seen by 140 million people so far.

Tourism Australia's most high-profile TV partnership was with American talk show host Oprah Winfrey in December 2010. Her four shows from Australia were shown in Canada and the US in January 2011, and repeated in the US two months later.

Did that result in more American visitors to Australia? According to market research in October 2011 of 500 Americans who had either travelled to Australia in the previous six months or had booked to travel in the next 12 months, 73 per cent said the show had influenced their decision to pick Australia as their destination.

In November 2011, Tourism Australia targeted the Indian market, helping to finance which included locations such as the Opera House, Darling Harbour and Kings Cross. About 23 million people saw it.

The following year, Melbourne had a chance to star (alongside Sydney and Tasmania) in Heartbeat Love, a Taiwanese online mini-series starring Rainie Yang and Show Lo, which was seen by 10 million people in China.

Tourism Australia says it is notoriously hard to measure exactly how such broadcasts influence decisions about long-haul travel.

However, if visitor numbers and spending are any guide, both India and China are at record highs. The latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the number of Indians and Chinese visiting Australia in the year ended July 2015 were 222,000 and 939,500 – a rise of 19.2 per cent and 21.6 per cent respectively.

""This is really about getting Brand Australia seen by as many eyeballs as we can,"" explains John O'Sullivan, Tourism Australia's managing director. ""Our arrivals from Brazil over the past 12 months are up by 19 per cent. Brazil is a fast emerging market. There is a growing middle class that has high disposable income, they want to travel, and they are beginning to discover Australia. So it is a market we want to build on over the next five years. ""And this type of telenovela will reach around 22 million viewers per minute. Some 156 million Brazilians admit to watching one of Globo's telenovelas. That's 78 per cent of the nation's population. For us, this is all about building our brand and our presence in Brazil. ""We have identified Brazil – along with the United States and China – as one of three markets we are focusing on in the premium travel sector. Our target is to get a 10 per cent increase in luxury travel out of those three markets over the next 12 months."" Globo produces several telenovelas a year, each one screening for six days a week for six months. While the locations obviously have to fit the plot, the three Australian tourism bodies had a say in which parts of Australia figure in the show. For example, the director asked for suggestions about where to film a bar scene. Opera Bar, with its views of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, suited everyone. It's hardly the first time Tourism Australia has invested in foreign TV shows or films as a way of seducing would-be tourists. Two episodes of Running Man, a South Korean adventure challenge series, were shot in the Gold Coast and Melbourne in 2013 and were aired in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia as well as Korea. Korean visitors to Australia rose by 8 per cent in the year ended July 2015. Coincidence? Australian-born, Britain-based chef John Torode is now in discussions with Tourism Australia and UKTV about a second series of John Torode's Australia. The first series – filmed in NSW, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia – was so successful it was repeated several times on UKTV's Good Food Channel. Likewise, American chef Eric Ripert recently filmed six episodes of his Avec Eric In Australia TV series on the Cooking Channel, which have been seen by 140 million people so far. Tourism Australia's most high-profile TV partnership was with American talk show host Oprah Winfrey in December 2010. Her four shows from Australia were shown in Canada and the US in January 2011, and repeated in the US two months later. Did that result in more American visitors to Australia? According to market research in October 2011 of 500 Americans who had either travelled to Australia in the previous six months or had booked to travel in the next 12 months, 73 per cent said the show had influenced their decision to pick Australia as their destination. In November 2011, Tourism Australia targeted the Indian market, helping to finance which included locations such as the Opera House, Darling Harbour and Kings Cross. About 23 million people saw it. The following year, Melbourne had a chance to star (alongside Sydney and Tasmania) in Heartbeat Love, a Taiwanese online mini-series starring Rainie Yang and Show Lo, which was seen by 10 million people in China. Tourism Australia says it is notoriously hard to measure exactly how such broadcasts influence decisions about long-haul travel. However, if visitor numbers and spending are any guide, both India and China are at record highs. The latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that the number of Indians and Chinese visiting Australia in the year ended July 2015 were 222,000 and 939,500 – a rise of 19.2 per cent and 21.6 per cent respectively.

715854,5b2acdc0-606e-421c-9635-2dcaa1201225,Season high crowd turns into tragedy,Journal Review,"When the Yankees come to a city near you, if you’re a baseball fan you go. It’s what you do.  
  
When Derek Jeter was hunting for hit 3,000 and the team from the Queen City came strolling into Cincinnati in the summer of 2011, I was there to see my beloved Yankees.  
      
In 2009, the year the Yankees last won a World Series Championship, I was there in late September to witness a Red Sox–Yankees game in the Bronx.  
 
I am a baseball fan, who loves attending games in person, and so attending the Braves–Yankees game in Atlanta last Saturday was a no-brainer.  
 
I have a friend who grew up a fan of the team dressed in pinstripes, so we made the quick trip down I-85 from Gardner-Webb University, where I attend college, to celebrate his recent turning of 21.  
 
Getting into Atlanta, well, not much fun. Leaving Atlanta was even Worse.  
 
But that’s not what this story is about.  
 
Last winter the Braves had a fire sale, sending all their stars to Houston, San Diego and St. Louis, while leaving fans shaking their heads. With that being said the Braves have been a dismal to watch this season and fans have just not showed up to games at Turner Field.  
 
That wasn’t the case last weekend when a season-high crowd of 47,000 — which was made up of a nice mix of Yankees and Braves fans — filed into their seats.  
 
Skipping ahead to the middle of the game — one that was quite boring, I might add, at least from my seat that was near the moon — is where this story gets interesting.  
 
It was in the top of the 7th inning and Alex Rodriquez was pinch-hitting. I was walking back up to my seat from getting a tasty treat of ice cream. A mixture of boos and cheers were happening at full throttle. But little did I know, as my back was turned to the field, something horrific was happening only a few feet from me.  
 
Just minutes later I was reading on my phone how Gregory Murray a 23-year-long season ticket holder had fallen out of section 451 while booing at A-Rod and landed on the main level below.  
 
My seat was in section 450.  
 
Questions are being raised about field safety for fans all around Major League Baseball lately, but I want to ignore that for the time being. This incident just proves how much social media and technology in general has changed and shaped our lives just in the past ten years. Because of Twitter, the entire stadium knew what had happened within minutes, even if fans didn’t witness it personally.  
 
Normally we would be talking about how social media would create a public relations mess for the Braves in this situation. Instead it was the Braves and the media who won the night.  
 
The Braves chose not to stop the game, even though people in the press box and several players saw what had happened. In my mind that move prevented potential mad chaos within the stadium.  
 
Another thing the Braves and media did was not identify the victim or identify his condition. Even though it was clear that he had died on impact of hitting the cement, the Braves did not make a statement or release any information about the victim until after the game was over and the dust had settled.  
 
With the way technology and social media dictates the world, I give an applaud to the Braves organization for how they handled the tragic situation.  
 
Social media can be a nightmare for many, but is an amazing tool that has made journalism and public relations jobs much easier and efficient when used in the right manner.

From robust curries and delicately spiced biriyanis to smoky kebabs and crisp dosas, the Kovalam bypass route is a treat for foodies 

Francis John looks forward to the weekends. That is when he and his friends explore the numerous eateries on the Kovalam bypass route after a day at the beach. Maya Swamy and her family too tend to relish the various flavours offered on this stretch of road. From robust curries and delicately spiced biriyanis to smoky kebabs and crisp dosas, this road treats foodies to a mouth-watering range of regionally diverse dishes. And there are eateries to please all pockets, right from fast food chains and fine dining restaurants to thattukadas and mid-range restaurants. The gourmet journey can begin with breakfast. Dine on buttery ghee roasts or puffy poories at the several vegetarian restaurants like Hotel Aryaas, Sri Saravana Bhavan or even at the evergreen Indian Coffee House. Lunch and dinner offer diners more varieties ranging from nadan to continental fare. 

For lunch, try the seafood basket at the newly opened Chemmeen: Seafood Village at Thiruvallam. It is rather filling with its portions of squid, crab, fish and prawns. You can choose to have these varieties of seafood cooked a la continental or Kerala style. 

Close by, tucked away from the blares of the highway at Thiruvallam, is Aswathy. This joint is extremely basic with a few long tables and chairs for customers. 

Although there are other such similar shacks and even small-scale restaurants on the Chakka-Kovalam stretch, one tends to wonder about the hygiene, as some of the restaurants are surrounded by garbage heaps, especially a few on the Paruthikuzhi stretch. 

Those who want a touch of nostalgia to their meal should try the pothi choru at Sagara. The sumptuous lunch, wrapped in a banana leaf, has rice, chamanthi, two or three vegetarian dishes, a prawns and a squid dish each, fried anchovy, omelette and sambar. Those who yearn for authentic North Indian food have Dhaba Project and Sharma Dhaba to indulge their cravings at. The lassis and paneer butter masala at Sharma Dhaba, and the kebab platter and the freshly made piping hot jalebis at Dhaba Project, come highly recommended by foodies. 

Want a cup of piping hot tea? An unnamed tea stall opposite Kazhakkuttam Police Station which is famous for its teas is the place to be. However, if you are more of a coffee person, drop by Café Coffee Day. 

Awadhi biriyani, Hyderabadi biriyani, Thalassery biriyani, Malabar biriyani... it’s a veritable non-stop biriyani mela for gourmands in the city as some restaurants serve just biriyanis. Our top biriyani spots on this stretch are Ajwa and Dharia. Lovers of mutton and chicken dishes should stop by Hotel Shabeer at Vallakkadavu Junction. 

Hotel Kingsway, Bigway Restaurant and Ginger Hotel offer customers a variety of cuisines. Kingsway has a sadya every day for lunch. So fans of sadya need not gate crash weddings for a taste of the spread. Travellers pining for fast food will find chains such as Subway and French Fried Chicken catering to their needs. 

Lijo Sagara of Sagara restaurant says the trend for restaurants, especially those along the Chakka-Kazhakkuttam stretch, is recent. “We started a branch of Sagara on the bypass two and a half years ago to attract the techie crowd and travellers.” 

Many others seem to have thought the same way and the number of eateries on the stretch have multiplied in no time. Well, the restaurateurs who saw potential in starting eat outs on that stretch seem to have hit the jackpot, judging by the crowd at the restaurants. 

Says Muhamed Naushad, one of the proprietors of Ajwa: “Our customers are mostly techies and travellers. We do get the city crowd, especially during the weekends.” 

The fact that most of the restaurants have ample parking space is a reason why there is a rush to these restaurants and the smooth roads make driving a pleasant experience, especially on Sundays, when the roads are clear and lack the rush to Technopark. So, where are you dining at this weekend?

Damon Wayans is under fire for shocking comments he made while defending Bill Cosby amidst his sex scandal. Fans are slamming Damon, who called some of Bill’s sexual assault accusers ‘unrapeable’ and said the scandal is simply a ‘money hustle. 

’ 

Damon Wayans, 55, is getting blasted on social media over jaw-dropping remarks he made on Power 105’s The Breakfast Club radio show on Sept. 4 while speaking about the Bill Cosby, 78, sex scandal. After calling some of Bill’s accusers “b**ches” and “unrapeable,” Twitter exploded with criticism aimed directly at Damon. 

In the interview, Damon said that he didn’t think Bill raped his accusers. He believes Bill was in a relationship with the women. He also questioned why the women waited so long to come forward. “Oh, really? Rape. Forty years — listen, how big is his penis that it gives you amnesia for 40 years?” Damon said. 

“And some of them, really, is unrapeable,” he continued. “I look at them and go, ‘No, he don’t want that. Get outta here!’ Look, I understand fame. I’ve lived it. Women will throw themselves at you. They just want be in your presence. There’s some that innocently will come up there, but not 40-something women. They’re not that naive. 

” 

Here’s how Twitter reacted to those shocking statements:

  ""The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.""  Bruce Lee   
   Over the summer, I had the good fortune to take a tennis class to learn new things about a game I love. I went into it all ready to show the instructor my wicked ground strokes! I clenched down, gripped the racket and literally tried to kill the ball. After about 75% of my shots went into the net or way outside the lines, I got frustrated. What the hell was going on? During a break I asked the instructor what she thought the problem was. She immediately told me that I was working way too hard. My grip was too tight and I was losing all my power with my supposedly intense stroke. SHE THEN GAVE ME A TIP THAT I AM TAKING INTO EVERY PART OF MY LIFE: THE LOOSER YOU STAY, THE MORE POWER YOU WILL HAVE. WHAT? I've always thought that staying loose meant that you weren't taking things seriously. The more clenched, busy, and proactive I could be, the better. The more I focused on meeting others' needs, the more I would be liked. The delusional belief behind all of these thoughts went something like this.... the harder I work, the more worthy I am. I must push and overextend to be good enough. And this belief has brought me success...I did well in school, built a successful career, and have a wonderful family and friends. But as I woke up to this toxic message, I realized that every time I overextended in dance, I got hurt. When I tried too hard to connect with people, they backed away. When I put others' needs first, I often misread what they actually wanted, and almost always ended up abandoning myself. This way of living was tiring, leaving me achy and burnt out! And the worst part is that it was blocking the support that wanted to come into my life. So, since that fateful day on the tennis court, I've been experimenting with my coach's principle of working less to have more power. It is so subtle, but when I practice it one small choice at a time, I find many opportunities every day to loosen my grip on life and experience flow. The benefits are instant and available to all of us. What working LOOSE looks like: -WAIT. I try not to act until there is a genuine and actual reason to do something. When I feel an idea emerge, I write it down and it helps me determine whether it's driven by fear or urgency, or if it truly comes from my heart. When I have clarity, I can prioritize. -RELEASE. When I do not know the solution to a problem, I release it for a while instead of ruminating and forcing an answer prematurely. Asking for help from my higher self and then turning over the problem brings enormous freedom. -ACCEPT SUPPORT. I say yes to help and embrace compliments when I receive them. A tight grip is often critical and unforgiving. Accepting kindness from others helps us to be more loving with ourselves. -STAY IN THE MOMENT. When I'm working with a client or a group, I work hard to stay open and present instead of always thinking about the next topic, or how I could or should respond. -REST. I take breaks and let myself relax when the time is right instead of filling every second with something practical. -HONOR COMMITMENTS. I start on time, end on time, and honor my boundaries. These simple commitments are within my power, and they give me something I can always feel proud of. -DETACH FROM OUTCOMES. Before I offer help, I consider whether the person really wants help, or if I am offering it because it makes me feel better -- and more in control -- to fix things. Offering support and then letting go is a liberating way to truly help others. Working LOOSE does not look like: -Planning for people when they do not need my help. -Overextending and doing extra to look good or seem more worthy. -Jumping into action too quickly for the short-term satisfaction of feeling productive. -Judging others for their decisions when they differ from mine and forgetting that everyone is on their own path! -Staying busy when others around me are chilling and enjoying themselves. My questions for you are: Where can YOU loosen your grip on life a bit? Where can you harness your energy and resist the temptation to overextend? Where in your day do you silently accept more responsibility or work than is really necessary? How many relaxing little breaks can you build into your day?

A ring of sophisticated thieves is targeting Buc-ee’s. However, high-quality video and images from the store’s surveillance system could be key to arrests. 

11:52 p.m. CDT September 24, 2015 

FREEPORT, Texas – A ring of sophisticated thieves is targeting Buc-ee's. However, high-quality video and images from the store's surveillance system could be key to arrests. 

""We need them off the street as soon as possible,"" said Capt. Ray Garivey of the Freeport Police Department. 

Investigators identified a woman and three men caught on camera as members of a sophisticated, professional identity theft ring that has been ganging up on Texans' favorite beaver. 

In video released by Freeport police, the suspects appear to be customers shopping on their own dime. 

""I'm not sure why they would be targeting Buc-ee's,"" Valeria Hamid, a Buc-ee's customer said.  ""I don't know what that's about."" 

Detectives said the group first steals credit card numbers, and then, with cloned cards, the group shops. 

Photos: Surveillance footage of alleged Buc-ee's theft ring suspects 

In one month, they have visited 14 Buc-ee's stores from Temple to Freeport.  They're buying cigarettes by the carton.  So far, they've stolen nearly $18,000 dollars' worth. 

""They have a hell of an operation,"" said Buc-ee's customer Jay Martin.  ""That's absurd, though. They (are) taking innocent people's money."" 

Nine different police agencies need help stopping the ring. 

""We are all asking for help from the public in identifying these folks,"" Garivey said.  ""We can get them off the street. We need to put an end to this because people are suffering, not only Buc-cee's but the individuals they're stealing identities from."" 

For now, police are sharing video from Buc-ee's high-definition cameras that are in all of their stores and above every gas pump.  Those cameras gave detectives clean looks at four suspects.  Authorities hopes someone sees the video then helps end the spending spree. 

Most victims can simply refuse the charges on their credit cards, but Buc-ee's can't.  Eventually, costs may fall on customers. 

""There's no way in my mind (the suspects are) just doing Buc-ee's,"" Garivey said.  ""If they're doing one business, we're almost positive they're others.""",357,"up on Texans' favorite beaver.

Archive data consists of older data that is still important to the organization and may be needed for future reference, as well as data that must be retained for regulatory compliance . Data archives are indexed and have search capabilities so files and parts of files can be easily located and retrieved. 

Data archives are often confused with data backups , which are copies of data. Data backups are used as a data recovery mechanism that can be used to restore data in the event it is corrupted or destroyed. In contrast, data archives protect older information that is not needed for everyday operations but may have to be accessed occasionally. The data archives serve as a way of reducing primary storage consumption and related costs, rather than acting as a data recovery mechanism. Some data archives treat archive data as read-only to protect it from modification, while other products treat data as read / write. Data archiving is most suitable for data that must be retained due to operational or regulatory requirements, such as document files, email messages and possibly old database records. 
Data archiving benefits  
The greatest benefit of archiving data is that it reduces the cost of primary storage . Primary storage is typically expensive because a storage array must produce a sufficient level of IOPS to meet operational requirements for user read / write activity. In contrast, archive storage costs less because it is typically based on a low-performance, high-capacity storage medium. 
 
Archive storage also reduces the volume of data that must be backed up. Removing infrequently accessed data from the backup data set improves backup and restore performance, and lowers secondary storage costs. 
 Online vs. offline data storage  
Data archives take a number of different forms. Some systems make use of online data storage, which places archive data onto disk systems where it is readily accessible. Archives are frequently file-based, but object storage is growing in popularity. 
 
Other archival systems use offline data storage in which archive data is written to tape or other removable media using data archiving software rather than being kept online. Because tape can be removed, tape-based archives consume far less power than disk systems. This translates to lower archive storage costs. 
 
Cloud storage is another possible archive target. Amazon Glacier , for example, is designed for data archiving. Cloud storage is inexpensive but requires an ongoing investment. In addition, costs can grow over time as more data is added to the cloud archive. 
 Data archiving and data lifecycle management  
The archival process is almost always automated using archiving software. The capabilities of such software vary from one vendor to the next, but generally speaking the software will automatically move aging data to the archives according to a data archival policy set by the storage administrator. This policy may also include specific retention requirements for each type of data. Some archiving software will automatically purge data from the archives once it has exceeded the lifespan mandated by the organization's data retention policy . Many backup software platforms are adding archiving functionality to their products. Depending on your needs, this can be a cost-effective and efficient way to archive data.

90030,33c7395a-1ed3-40dd-980b-c7b82c91dfe4,The rise of the machines – an internet of things revolution designed in Ireland,Silicon Republic,"Almost two years ago to the day on a balmy night on the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome I sat outside for dinner with a bunch of young Intel engineers who talked excitedly but mysteriously about their work. At the head of the table sat Philip Moynagh who up until quite recently had headed one of Intel’s prestigious chip fabrication facilities in Leixlip but now was leading a mysterious skunkworks project. Close by sat a number of IDA executives who grinned with pride and said all would be revealed the next day at the Maker’s Faire in Rome. 
 
The next day Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich held aloft the Galileo dev board, emblazoned with the words ‘designed in Ireland’ which was powered by a Quark processor also ‘designed in Ireland.’ It was a defining moment in Ireland’s tech industry history, but few realised it at the time. 
 
Basically, Moynagh and his team of 70 young engineers seized the opportunity to design and create a chip and a dev board for the internet of things. Their pride and relief was palpable; a team of pirates within a very structured organisation broke the mould, took a big bet with their careers and set Intel on the road to powering the next tech revolution. 
 
This memory flooded back on Friday when I spotted Moynagh, now vice president of Intel’s Internet of Things group, in a photo with GAA officials revealing Croke Park to be the world’s first internet of things stadiums in a collaboration with the State University of Arizona. 
 Digital tapestry: designing Ireland as an internet of things testbed  
Croke Park, the third biggest stadium in Europe, is to set the template for Intel’s goal of making Dublin one the world’s first internet of things cities and projects underway include measuring stadium and fan experience by monitoring pitch quality and stadium microclimate, analysing athlete’s performance, predicting traffic to and from the stadium and developing apps that indicate queueing times at refreshment and convenience facilities. 
 
Effectively the stadium is to be festooned with sensors that have evolved from those early Galileo dev boards and Quark chips. 
 
If anything the whole tale is just one segment in wider tapestry being formed across Ireland where the internet of things – a world where machines connected to the internet – will transform industries from making things into providing services and give us greater insight into our daily lives. 
 
The global value of the IoT sector is predicted to exceed £25 billion a year (€34.2bn) by 2020 with an expectation that 4.9bn devices will be connected in 2015, rising to 25bn by 2025. 
 
If anything, from IoT sensors to drones, clever minds have realised that the world needs testbeds and Ireland fits the bill perfectly due to its modest population size and compact cities. National Geographic recently named Dublin as the capital for the internet of things. 
 
But this is a countrywide affair and Cork was recently selected as the location for Vodafone and EMC’s joint investment in a €2m IoT industrial test platform. The new testbed will provide facilities for the testing and exploration of technologies like machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The IoT Innovation platform is spread across three data centres in Cork: EMC, Vodafone, and data centre and cloud provider Cork Internet eXchange (CIX). Businesses will be able to use the platform to test solutions for the internet of things. 
 
But there is a whole sway of initiatives also underway including tech giants like IBM, start-ups like Movidus and major research initiatives from centres like Adapt, Insight and Tyndall. 
 
IBM, for example, has its own floating sea laboratory for the internet of things called Sealab. 
 
A chip designed by Dublin firm Movidius is at the heart of Google’s next big bet on IoT. Across the board companies like IBM, HP, SAP, Vodafone, Analog Devices, Intel, SAS, EMC and many others are working on IoT in Ireland. 
 
On the research front, academic and industrial collaborations facilitated by research groups like Tyndall, Amber, CRANN, Insight, Connect, Adapt and TSSG have put Ireland on the world stage for IoT-related breakthroughs. TSSG and Tyndall for example are pitching to raise €82m to fund 10 internet of things-focused start-ups . 
 The new industrialists have digital in their DNA  
Speaking with Siliconrepublic.com last year, Moynagh said Ireland has the opportunity within its grasp to be a leading powerhouse in the internet of things revolution. 
 
“With an unflinching focus on high return for our investment, we need to architect and implement IoT solutions that address our biggest challenges. We need outstanding cost-effective healthcare for an aging population. 
 
“We need world-class education for our kids and our adults. We need smart rooms in smart buildings in smart cities with smart transport delivering safer, healthier, energy efficient, productive living. We need to attract the best companies and we need to start and build the best companies in the world.” 
 
But we also need smart graduates. While Ireland is benefiting from a major influx of tech investment leading to thousands of new jobs in technology, the war for skills is raging as furiously as ever and students and graduates are needed to fuel the next decade of growth. 
 
According to the CEO of Waterford Institute of Technology’s TSSG research group Barry Downes a new kind of graduate capable of understanding software and microelectronics will be needed. The college has created a new internet of things-focused computer science degree which will be led by Eamonn de Leastar. 
 
Downes said that one of the challenges with IoT is it requires a broad scope of expertise ranging from coding to knowledge of microelectronics and electrical engineering. 
 
“We want to create graduates who have that capability to solve internet of things problems end-to-end, whether it is through building a sensor, connecting it to the internet and building the software to connect it to other systems.” 
 
Leading minds like Moynagh and Downes are needed to steward Ireland in the right direction and with the right energy to seize the internet of things opportunity. 
 
That opportunity will allow manufacturers of everything from toasters to TVs and thermostats to reinvent themselves as service providers. That opportunity will propel Ireland from having missed the industrial revolution of the 19 th century to being at the coalface in the 21 st century, where inventors and entrepreneurs will be the new industrialists.

Zainab Awad, 37, lives in Padras, a town known for its cultivation of cacti. She wakes up early every day to harvest the fruit. Awad, who works as a teacher in a private-sector kindergarten, harvests cacti in the summer as a second source of income. 
 
“In the summer months, I harvest and sell cacti,” she told Anadolu Agency . “It is the main source of income for my family and I because I do not receive any salary during the summer holiday.” 
 
“Cacti are a delicious fruit favoured by Palestinians in summer, especially by the poor due to its low price compared with other types of fruit,” she added. 
 
Wearing plastic gloves, Awad uses special brooms or carob tree branches to clean the cacti. 
 
The price of one kilogram is about three shekels ($0.80) and the name of the fruit differs from one country to the next in the Arab world. 
 ""Sabr""

With a toothy grin, Jakobe Sanden looks like any other 7-year-old American boy. But when he returned to school this year, his welcome was anything but ordinary.

Sanden, who is Native American, was pulled out of class last week at Arrowhead Elementary School in Santa Clara, Utah, over concerns his traditional mohawk haircut would be a distraction to other students.

“He’s had a mohawk off-and-on his whole life,” his mother Teyawwna Sanden told Fox13. “I didn’t think it was a big deal.”



School administrators, however, said the haircut violated dress code. Arrowhead’s official handbook makes no mention of hairstyle, citing only that “hair color should be within the spectrum of color that hair grows naturally.” But the district code states, “Students have the responsibility to avoid grooming that causes a distraction or disruption, interrupting school decorum and adversely affecting the educational process,” and notes, “Extremes in body piercings, hair styles and hair colors may be considered a distraction or disruption,” the Washington Post reported.

Lyndon LaRouche warned this evening against any misguided expectation that Barack Obama will strike a deal with Putin for peace in the Middle East when Putin
arrives in New York City this coming weekend. Instead, LaRouche said, Obama is more likely to start a war or try to start one. 

LaRouche called upon sane forces in the United States government to block this, and, if they wish to build a a truly secure future for the United States, to move to impeach Obama now. 

Putin’s flanking action, moving Russian forces directly into the President’s genocidal war in Syria, has trapped Obama, exposing his actual support for British/Saudi terror operations in Southwest Asia and against Russia itself. LaRouche predicted that Putin’s actions have driven Obama wild, citing his “kill list” obsession with alleged terrorists during his first term of office. 

“Don’t assume that what is involved here is a normal kind of political disagreement; it is not. What you’re looking at is, you’re looking at a bastard, a really evil bastard made in the image of his stepfather, who was one of the most evil bastards in the southern hemisphere...

""Never forget how Obama went into the killing business from the first years of his term; it was killing, target someone, kill them. Don’t convict them of crimes, don’t take them into custody from committing crimes, don’t intervene to prevent them from committing crimes...

""Look at the number of people he’s killed; and how they’ve been killed. This man is a butcher; he’s a killer just like his stepfather."" 

It is widely documented that Obama’s drone strikes against his targets killed women and children while recruiting yet more young people to barbarism. Obama’s
record does not support any contention that he will strike a deal for defeating terror or establishing peace. 

LaRouche continued: 

""Don’t assume there’s a negotiation pending. A hard blow is what’s required. When the action comes, the hard blow comes against it. Shut him down, discharge him, call him a murderer. Publicly, an international murderer, not fit for human beings’ company, period... But what Putin’s moved in on, is what’s going to trigger what Obama will do, when he comes to react. Because Putin has frustrated – Putin has humiliated him before most parts of the planet. He’s going to want to kill Putin more than anything else. So don’t assume there’s a political operation going on; it’s post-political. It’s murderous.""",405,"has trapped Obama, exposing his actual support for British/Saudi terror operations in Southwest Asia and against Russia itself.

But an ambitious project launched this weekend by a successful British film and television composer is reinventing the way artists and writers can publish their work online. Theft is theft. There is no difference between stealing digital content and stealing from a shop - though it's easier Hélène Muddiman “People often say the internet is too hard to police, but in fact it is easier to police than the real world,” said Hélène Muddiman, 48, who lives and works in Los Angeles. “Theft is theft. There is no difference between stealing digital content and stealing from a shop, other than, at present, it’s easier.” After more than a year of campaigning under the banner Free At What Cost?, the musician, who was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for her film score for Skin in 2010 and who writes music for many television shows, including The Only Way is Essex, has built up a growing movement on both sides of the Atlantic to push for a solution: a coding device for all, that would label and protect creative material before it is viewed. Free At What Cost? wants to prevent artists from losing money online. Related: Imogen Heap: saviour of the music industry? She believes deploying a technical protection on a new file to charge the online audience a small amount each time they click offers a practical solution. Last week the artist Imogen Heap put forward her plan for recording artists to use the technology behind bitcoin, the internet currency, to solve the problem. Muddiman and the Free At What Cost? movement believe they are closer to an answer. Their system would allow artists and creators to make a small amount of money, sent direct to their accounts, when their work is viewed. In an age when most professional artists and writers struggle to make money, Muddiman believes this would provide a regular income, securing a supply of content in the future. British stars Billy Bragg, Neil Innes, Adam Ant and the Bond and Sherlock composer David Arnold are some well-known names backing the shared technology that Muddiman and her team are developing on a not-for-profit basis. If widely adopted, the composer says it could change the economics of the web. Speaking in the campaign documentary, Free At What Cost?, Ant said the “hippie idea” that everything should be free on the net only sounds fine to those who are not creators. “People that don’t write say that, people that don’t perform say that, people that don’t have a passion say that, but I do, and I think it’s a diabolical liberty,” he said. Touring is no answer either, Ant adds, because so many venues are closing down. If I create something I want to give away, I can; if I want to sell it, I should be able to – my choice, not end-users' David Arnold, composer “Shops, pubs and cinemas have to monitor what they sell to people, why not ISPs?” asks Arnold. “If I create something I want to give away, then I can give it away; if I want to sell it, I should be able to sell it – it’s my choice, not the end-user’s choice. Education and awareness are always the way forward. Most people don’t break laws as long as they know what the laws are.” The musicians might sound like King Canutes, vainly holding back the tide, but they hope to motivate others to take action. “It is time for the moral majority to dominate the conversation,” Muddiman said. Bragg admits there was a mix up on his part when he criticised Taylor Swift for removing her music from Spotify in the mistaken belief it would then be streamed on YouTube’s new Music Key. Yet he argues it is now vital to find a solution for all artists and performers: “Sooner or later we are going to work out how to analyse all that data and we are going to find out where all the money is going and it’s not gonna be pretty.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Madonna performs at the Grammy awards in Los Angeles last March. Her net worth last year of $800m is dwarfed by the annual revenues of online content providers. Photograph: John Shearer Muddiman points out that while Madonna’s net worth was valued at $800m last year, and Paul McCartney’s at $660m, Google’s revenue for that year was $66bn and Apple’s $182.8bn. “The public consumes free or cheap creative goods voraciously online in an ‘all you can eat’ environment,” she said. “This is because many sites are not in the business of selling and distributing the product at a reasonable price, they are in the business of selling advertising. They claim to share their vast advertising revenue with creators, but they make the rules. YouTube only shares 55% of advertising revenue with those who achieve over 700,000 views per upload in a quarter, so it is in YouTube’s interest for multiple people to upload the same content to dilute the viewers so they pay out less money to creators.” Some online services, such as Copyscape, already offer to track down plagiarised content and find illegally reproduced material, but these operate after-the-fact as a prelude to litigation, rather than as a method of prevention. In Britain, copyright advice suggests artists and creators should clearly label their uploaded work, despite the fact this is not legally required. They also advocate keeping notes, manuscripts and early drafts so that ownership can be proven. Muddiman concedes a groundswell of popular support will be needed to go against vested interests. She is, she said, not against freedom of expression, but argues the commercial side of the web needs to be reorganised to allow an income for freelance artists, photographers, musicians and writers. “It’s not too late or too difficult to create this change.

Today : Tuesday 22 September 2015 
  (FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 9/23/15) 
   By Stephanie Gleason and Ted Mann  
Quirky Inc., an invention startup, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on Tuesday, showing the challenges of picking winners when it comes to consumer products and investment opportunities. 
 
The bankruptcy filing is a far fall for a company that initially showed promise, with an ambitious, young founder, corporate partnerships and a reality-TV show on the Sundance Channel. Quirky had been able to raise $170 million from several firms, including Norwest Venture Partners LP, RRE Ventures, General Electric Co.'s GE Ventures LLC and Andreessen Horowitz Fund LP, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource, which like The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp. 
 
But growing pains and losses from unsuccessful products brought Quirky to bankruptcy, though it is poised to accept a $15 million offer for its Wink subsidiary, a software platform for smart-home products. Flextronics International Ltd., a manufacturing company that provided hardware for Wink, made the bid for the subsidiary. 
 
Quirky hopes to find a buyer for the remainder of its business, though it warned it could discontinue products that don't find a new home. 
 
Quirky said it has $53.9 million in assets versus $136.8 million in liabilities. As a result, investors are likely to lose their equity stakes. 
 
When he founded Quirky in 2009, Ben Kaufman aimed to create a crowd-sourced invention platform, whereby inventors could pitch their ideas and solicit help. Quirky would develop the products it believed were hits and pay royalties to the inventors. It achieved success with simple products like the Pivot Power, a flexible power strip that sold more than 1.5 million units. 
 
But the misses -- like a digital egg tray that told consumers how many eggs were left in the refrigerator -- plagued the company's profitability. 
 
As its roster of products grew to 150 from 34, Quirky rapidly expanded its operations but struggled to bring such a diverse array of products to market. 
 
""In short, Quirky was unable to attain manufacturing and distribution scale, and sustained significant losses on many of these products,"" the company said in court documents filed Tuesday. 
 
Earlier this year Quirky decided to get out of the product development business and focus on its partnerships with companies like GE, and its consulting arm through the acquisition of Undercurrent LLC. 
 
But the change in focus didn't fix Quirky's immediate problem: it needed cash. 
 
Quirky's $19.9 million revolving loan from Comerica Bank was coming due in October and $36.8 million in convertible bonds were set to mature at the end of the year, though they could be converted to stock then. The company also would have to start paying up to $8 million of the Undercurrent purchase price that had been deferred. 
 
GE said Tuesday it was disappointed that Quirky filed for bankruptcy but will continue introducing smart products of its own this fall. GE said it would continue to make products to be used with Wink. 
 
By late summer, Quirky lost the leases for offices in New York and San Francisco, laid off 159 employees and replaced Mr. Kaufman as CEO. 
 
Flextronics struck a deal with Quirky's landlords in New York, allowing it to stay on a short-term, rent-free basis. Quirky entered bankruptcy with 90 employees, most of whom work for Wink, after securing Flextronics's bid, which Quirky hopes to put to the test at a November auction.

520383,4f3028ad-2cbb-412b-899b-6c7553376063,"Stephen Colbert, Donald Trump: The Art of the Interview",MSN Entertainment,"Stephen Colbert is bringing something new and extraordinarily timely to late-night TV, as he demonstrated in the eagerly awaited “ Late Show ” appearance by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Tuesday night. Call it the art of the funny, not fawning interview — a chat that conjures laughs without completely sacrificing substance. Without pointing any fingers, some of his competitors should consider taking notes. 

Colbert, of course, had a knack for creating amusing exchanges with guests while on “The Colbert Report,” but that was improvising his smug blowhard of a conservative host. In this new venue, he has slowly adapted those skills, punctuated by his discussions this week with two GOP candidates, the other being Ted Cruz on Monday. 

In both instances, Colbert managed to actually ask some fairly provocative questions without ever making the exchanges uncomfortable. And when a response from Cruz about gay marriage elicited groans from the crowd, Colbert quickly admonished them, saying, “Guys, however you feel, he’s my guest. Please don’t boo him.” 

While it’s unfair and perhaps unnecessary to keep comparing them, Colbert’s visit from Trump stood in stark contrast to the mogul’s appearance on “The Tonight Show” less than two weeks ago, where Jimmy Fallon featured him in a canned segment and then largely giggled his way through their time together at the desk. 

By contrast, Colbert had fun with Trump’s brashness (he joked in his opening that he could tell his grandkids he had interviewed “the last President of the United States”), but allowed him to speak his piece. At the same time, he challenged the candidate to state, plainly, after his plunge into birther-ism whether he believes President Obama was born in the U.S., to which Trump simply declined to respond, providing the night’s inevitable headline. 

It was, in a way, a win-win for both men. Trump exhibited at least some sense of humor about himself, while still getting in plenty of his talking points. And Colbert didn’t hide his skepticism about some of Trump’s policies — like the proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico — but kept the conversation light and amusing, not hiding areas of disagreement but being polite about them. Moreover, he doubled down on that by engaging in a detail-oriented discussion about the U.S.-Iran deal with Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, before presenting him with a copy of Trump’s signed book. 

What seems increasingly clear is that — setting ratings aside — in terms of arriving at a time that maximized his ability to cash in on his unique set of skills, Colbert couldn’t have picked a better moment, with the presidential race, thanks in part to Trump, having become so inexorably tied up in pop culture. And while no one expects a return to the days of Jack Paar or Dick Cavett (who, not incidentally, has wholeheartedly endorsed  Colbert), “Late Show” is showing it’s possible to move beyond the typical celebrity guest list and not only generate laughs, but win the next-day news cycle as well.

175555,e266f1b9-5d9d-42d8-9e1a-ecddc7143f34,CITI: It might be time for SeaWorld to sell its park in Orlando (SEAS),Connecticut Post,"SeaWorld's business has been taking it on the chin lately, and one analyst says it may be time for the company to consider cutting bait and ditch its Orlando location. 

According to Jason Bazinet at Citi, the struggling amusement park brand is getting outmaneuvered by its competitors in the Florida market, and there may be solid benefits to selling the land and its east coast park. 

SeaWorld's rough couple of years started with the CNN documentary Blackfish, and recently got even worse after boy-band One Direction's Harry Styles called for fans to boycott the park, prompting a massive amount of negative consumer sentiment. 

The negative PR has led to decreasing attendance and revenue for the company, and Bazinet says that is focused primarily in two of the company's 13 locations. 

""Interestingly, the lions’ share of this decline occurred at just two parks: SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Diego,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""These two parks represented about 85% of the attendance declines across the firm’s 11 theme parks. Yet, in 2008 these two parks made up only 45% of SeaWorld’s aggregate visitors."" 

According to Bazinet, SeaWorld has been losing visitors to Universal Orlando. Furthermore, the negative sentiment from Blackfish has been particularly robust in Florida. 

This led Bazinet to a radical, and admittedly unlikely, possibility: SeaWorld should sell their Orlando park. 

Both Disney and Comcast, owners of the Universal theme parks, have made or are planning expansions to their theme park operations. Bazinet said SeaWorld could possibly sell to either of the two. 

The Florida location made the most sense, said Bazinet, because SeaWorld owns the land instead of leasing it like in San Diego and it has experienced the greatest attendance declines. Selling the land would generate $500 million in after-tax value, according to his analysis, against a loss of $25 million in free cash flow. 

This would also mitigate the attendance loss percentages. ""Without the 407,000 decrease in attendance from SeaWorld Orlando, total attendance would have decreased 2.5% instead of 4.3%,"" said Bazinet. ""Simply selling Orlando gives SeaWorld a comparable 2014 attendance decline as Six Flags (-2% attendance)."" 

Finally, Bazinet calculates that the revenue generated would go to share buybacks and paying down debt, which would raise the company's share price $6, from around $18 currently to $24, and its free cash flow multiple would jump from 10.5x to 12x. 

Bazinet admits this is a nuclear option, but if such substantial attendance losses continue, all options have to be explored.

A 25-year-old Butte man is robbed at gunpoint late Tuesday evening after meeting up with a potential buyer responding to a craigslist post. Butte police are issuing a warning to remind folks to stay safe when using craigslist to buy and sell property.

The crime happened in a parking lot behind the La Quinta Inn hotel in Butte which at night becomes a pretty desolate area. Police said the victim listed his Bowtech compound bow for sale with an asking price of $600 on craigslist. 

The victim told police he had been communicating with the person he thought was a legitimate buyer and agreed to meet up Tuesday evening around 11:00 p.m. Police said the victim presented the bow and arrows in a case to the buyer and that's when the buyer pulled out a gun, at which point the victim ran away leaving his merchandise to be stolen.

IOI Corp also remained one of the most profitable plantation groups on the research house’s list, although the group dropped to third spot, while TSH made it to the list of top-five most profitable planters.
Maybank KE said 2013 was a tree stress year for some plantation groups, as fresh fruit bunch (FFB) yield fell for First Resources Ltd, IJM Plantations Bhd, Golden Agri Resources Ltd, Ta Ann Holdings Bhd and PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk (AALI).
“In terms of the best yield achieved by the groups on our list, TSH posted the best CPO yield for 2013 at 5.3 tonnes per ha, boosted by its high FFB yield of 25.3 tonnes a ha and oil extraction rate of 21%.
“This was followed by IOI Corp (5.1 tonnes per ha) and Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) (4.8 tonnes per ha). The bottom-three spots were occupied by Kencana Agri at 3.3 tonnes per ha, Sarawak Oil Palms Bhd (3.4 tonnes per ha) and Boustead Plantations Bhd (3.6 tonnes per ha),” the research house said.
In terms of profitability, Singapore’s First Resources retained its top spot on Maybank KE’s list as the most profitable upstream plantation group in 2013, with an earnings before interest and tax of about RM9,620 per ha, partly supported by its locked-in sales at high prices.
Singapore-listed Bumitama Agri Ltd (BAL) moved up one spot from 2012 at the expense of IOI Corp, which dropped to third spot. TSH’s improved FFB yield have propelled the group to the top-five position.
By inference, Maybank KE said “the more profitable groups have the lower cost structure per tonne of CPO and could weather the current low CPO price” better than their peers.
Nevertheless, Maybank KE said the top-five listed oil palm planters in the world in 2013 remained unchanged from 2012, with Sime Darby Bhd (525,000ha) taking the top position, followed by Golden Agri (371,000ha), Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV) (335,000ha), Wilmar International Ltd (241,000ha) and Indofood Agri (239,000ha).
“Overall, the top-10 planters account for slightly under 20% of the total oil palm planted area globally,” the research house said.
Maybank KE noted that integrated players with downstream operations, diversified players and relatively low-cost producers, including IOI Corp, Sime Darby, First Resources, KLK and BAL, were least sensitive to CPO price changes.
“Those that have purer upstream exposure and relatively high all-in cost of production (per tonne) are the most leveraged due to either their relatively lower oil yield or higher cost base. They include TH Plantations Bhd, FGV, Boustead Plantations, AALI and Ta Ann, whereby for every RM100 per tonne change in the CPO average selling price (on a full-year basis), their earnings, we estimate, would change by 10%-13%,” Maybank KE said.

The Daily Mail reported on Tuesday morning that the back-row pair had failed to make the cut for the tournament which kicks-off next month in England and the Dark Blues confirmed the news as Cotter unveiled his squad at Edinburgh University's Old College Quad.

Cowan's omission in particular is a major surprise after the New Zealand-born London Irish forward started all five of the Scot's matches in this year's RBS 6 Nations.

Barlcay, meanwhile ended a near-two year exile from the squad when he was recalled for the warm-up clashes with Ireland and Italy.

But despite scoring in Saturday's 48-7 romp at Murrayfield over the Azzurri, the on-form Scarlets number seven has also been left out of Cotter's travelling party.

Gloucester scrum-half Greig Laidlaw will continue to skipper the side.

To add further controversy to that decision, the man benefiting from Cotter's decision was John Hardie - who only arrived in Scotland five weeks ago from New Zealand and has played just 57 minutes of international rugby after making his debut in Turin last week.

Josh Strauss is also included, despite the fact the Glasgow number eight - born in South Africa - only qualifies for Scotland through residency rules five days before his adopted nation's first match against Japan in Gloucester on September 23.

Glasgow lock Rob Harley also misses out, with his place taken by Warriors team-mate Tim Swinson, despite missing the warm-up series through injury.

Ruaridh Jackson, Adam Ashe, Greig Tonks, Jim Hamilton and Hugh Blake are also left behind.

Sean Maitland and Ryan Grant have shaken off injury troubles to claim their places but the Scots continue to sweat on the fitness of Alex Dunbar as he fights to recover from a knee ligament tear. He has not been named in the initial squad but could yet be called up if he can prove his cruciate has returned to full strength and someone else drops out.

Scotland, who have one final run out against France this Saturday, will also take on the United States, South Africa and Samoa as they bid to escape Pool B and make the quarter-finals.

Cotter said: ""There's a g ood balance of strength, power and experience in this squad. The boys have w orked hard to get there and I know they can't wait to get started. 

""We've had a tough few months together but we knew right from start that it was 46 to be cut to 31 and it wasn't easy.

""This is what can happen from design specifications,"" explains Joe Williams. ""A lot will be needed before any kind outtake happens so most power generation operations would need additional battery life."" For such designs which are built using conventional materials like wood pellets, concrete / metal/hydrogen etc., bulk pack packs were designed first here under UK Department Of Power Rule 2710 where 'a large volume reduction' was introduced; therefore no small quantity quantities could come later because existing batteries often ended service without ever generating excess electricity within two years - all else being equal excepting heat loss since they may absorb thermal vapour during operation..."

2015-09-23 
23 September 2015: It seems that you can't read a technology article these days without someone writing that the smartphones of 2015 have more computing power than was used to deliver the Apollo 11 space program. It's apocryphal but almost certainly true. And nowhere are we feeling the benefits of this massive increase in speed and latency than in the provision of enterprise mobility solutions. 

It's incredible to think that something possessing a quad-core processor with 2GB RAM and 32GB storage would have been the spec of a reasonable laptop or PC a few years ago. But today, these credentials refer to a Smartphone running an operating system built primarily with consumers in mind, and a 5"" screen that sits neatly in your pocket. 

However, increased performance and storage capacity in such a small form also creates substantial risks for businesses. 

By design mobile devices are permanently connected to public networks. They don't have the 'luxury' of residing in a secure private network protected by firewalls and threat management systems, with on-premise servers pushing out security patches and updates. Mobile devices live in a big bad world and need to be taken care of with some tender loving care and also some ""tough love"". 

Interestingly though in 2013 the Coalition government set out a plan and issued a tender to move all the voice and data communications of the Emergency Services off a private closed network and onto the ever widening public 4g network. The transfer is still going ahead as planned so that is an endorsement of current mobile security protocols if there ever was! 

With infectious, security breaching and data corrupting dangers literally floating through the air choosing the right Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution that will extend across all major device platforms should be an absolute necessity. Throw in human error and a potential dose of malignant employee behaviour and you have a perfect storm of mobile device integrity nightmares. 

But before you switch off your phone and shut down your broadband Olive can help IT managers stay right on top of their Mobile Device Management. 

They just need to follow this simple Olive checklist: 

Security 
Ensure devices are at the right operating system software level and not 'Jailbroken' or 'Rooted' Apply the relevant secure passcodes to devices Enforce device encryption to protect data on devices Retain the ability to wipe data from devices if lost or stolen Restrict access to corporate resources when devices become non-compliant Remove corporate data and apps from employee owned devices if they leave (essential for BYOD) Keep corporate email and attachments in a secure ‘workplace' on the device, away from personal data 
Management 
Establish visibility of all devices connecting to your systems through a single console Publish business applications to devices Audit devices for installed software Configure corporate email, Wi-Fi and VPN settings on devices Lock devices in 'Kiosk' mode for when they perform a specific task Create application whitelists and blacklists to prevent staff from using consumer-grade apps to access and share corporate data 
Monitoring 
Receive alerts when devices become non-compliant Monitor mobile data usage on devices and create threshold alerts Ability to notify administrators when device connects to roaming networks. Maintain visibility of all mobile devices connecting to Microsoft Exchange (through Cloud Extender) 
Once IT managers have run through this checklist, and established a base level of understanding, we then work with them to help them implement the right MDM solution for their business. Mobile Device Management is not a ""dark art""; it needs to be powerful, scalable and is an absolute business necessity. You lock the doors of your office so why not the ""doors"" to your mobile devices?

880852,d526deaa-ffcb-4666-bcd7-06cfadd9a30e,Journalist Alan Morison to quit Phuketwan post legal victory,Inverell Times,"Days after a Thai court threw out defamation charges against Alan Morison, the Australian journalist has announced he is quitting Phuketwan, his award-winning digital news site. Bangkok: Days after a Thai court threw out defamation charges against Alan Morison the Australian journalist has announced he is quitting Phuketwan, his award-winning digital news site. Morison, 67, said he and Thai journalist Chutima Sidasathian, 34, have decided to move on from the publication and it will close on January 1 if no buyer can be found.

""We stayed on after the Royal Thai Navy sued us to fight for media freedom and for the stateless Rohingya boatpeople,"" Morison said.

""But those important issues are now much more widely understood. The bit-players are starting over,"" he said.

In a case with far-reaching implications for media freedom in Thailand a court last week ruled that Morison and Chutima had no intention to damage Thailand's reputation in a story published in Phuketwan in 2013.

Judges said the information they published came from Reuters, a reliable news organisation, and was not their own.

Morison, a former senior editor of The Age, has been spending his life's savings publishing the Pulitzer prize winner Phuketwan site which has led coverage of the plight of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, who have been described by the United Nations as among the world's most persecuted people.

Cardiff (United Kingdom) (AFP) 

Laboured reviews by television match officials and repeated stoppages to get set pieces right, particularly at scrum time, have seen the sport referred to as ‘the game played in heaven’ being portrayed in a bad light. 

It’s left the fans frustrated and the players bored, according to the All Blacks. 

The stop-start nature has been particularly evident in pool matches between the top tier sides and the lesser teams who pad out the 20-team competition.

Stoppage time extended the showpiece tournament opener between England and Fiji from 80 minutes to more than 100. The 40 minutes in the All Blacks second half against Namibia produced just over 12 minutes of actual playing time. 

One scrum in the Namibia match took four minutes to complete and “that’s not what the game wants,” All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said. 

“You get a game like (against Namibia) the goodwill probably goes out the door, you get frustrated and I’m talking about the fans,” he said after his number one-ranked side scored nine tries in beating the rank outsiders 58-14. 

Signs that the so-called minnows are closing the gap are evident with the cricket scores of previous World Cups no longer evident and the All Blacks 58 points posted against Namibia is the highest total from the first 13 games in the 48-match tournament. 

But while ridiculously high scores have been reined in the clamour for perfect rulings appears to have ballooned out.

All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster attributed their unconvincing performance against Namibia to the stop-start nature of the game. 

“It looked like we got bored,” he said. “When the game got slow and we were trying to make things up that’s when we sort of lost our form and our patience a little bit.” 

Lengthy delays while the match officials (TMOs) review incidents and tries has “clearly been a talking point” said Foster although he defended the need for officials to ensure decisions were correct. 

“But when you tally that up with the slowing down at scrums, with injuries and that sort of stuff those two things together are like a perfect storm.” 

The All Blacks try to use breaks in the game to review their play and plan ahead.

“For large parts of the first two games we have used that time quite wisely, but there were just so many times we got confronted with that situation,” Foster declared.

“It wasn’t just TMOs, it was injury breaks, it was whatever was happening at scrum time, it was those breaks and they just multiplied.” 

For the All Blacks, who like to play a high-octane game, a third issue was opposing teams deliberately slowing play down to unsettle their rhythm and Foster said that was something the referees had to sort out. 

“Teams can do it if they think it’s a tactic that’s going to work against us. They’re going to keep trying. 

“We’ve got to keep an eye on that but really it’s up to the officials to keep the game moving and if they believe a team is deliberately doing it they’re got to try and speed them up. 

“In someways that’s outside our control. We’ve just got to do what we can control. We can ask that a game be speeded up but that’s only our opinion and in the meantime if it does slow down we’ve just got to be better with dealing with that.”

RICHMOND, Indiana — Earlham College is in the midst of a multi-million dollar push to transform the eastern Indiana school. 
 
The Quaker-affiliated liberal arts college has since 2013 completed overhauls on two buildings, erected a baseball stadium, revamped the football field and built a new center for visual and performing arts. 
 
The latest project is a $16.6 million building that houses the Richmond campus' math, physics and computer science departments. 
 
Earlham spokesman Brian Zimmerman tells the Palladium-Item ( http://pinews.co/1JF0Atu ) that all of the projects represent more than $70 million in investments in the future of the campus about 65 miles east of Indianapolis. 
 
A $1.5 million renovation is expected to begin soon to convert the campus' Runyan Center into a two-story lounge.

The southern Africans' latest loss, going down 58-14 to New Zealand in their opener, was tinged with positivity, and Burger is confident a victory will come.

""If we start slow against them, Tonga will punish us,"" the Saracens flanker warned ahead of the game at Exeter's Sandy Park.

""It remains our goal to win - it's not impossible. We know how tough Tonga are as a rugby side.

""We want to win. Not to compete, but to win. It'll be tough but we want to do everything in our power to do that. We want to win a match at the World Cup and that's still our aim.""

Tonga went down to a surprise 17-10 defeat by Georgia in their opening match and Burger said the Namibians will be ready for a backlash.

""You can expect a tough game tomorrow,"" he said.

""We will throw everything at them - it will be a tough match.

""Tonga are a really dangerous side. They've got a very physical way of playing. When we do kick we have to make a good chase. We have to chase really hard. What we lack in skills, or speed and power, we have to make up in desire.""

While Tonga mathematically remain in the hunt for second place in Pool C, they have still to play the All Blacks and fellow heavyweights Argentina, who finish up their pool campaign against Namibia.

So Tongan thoughts might be more fixed on finishing third in the pool to seal automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup.

""The way I look at it, our toughest opponent will be our next opponent,"" is Tonga coach Mana Otai's philosophy.

""We are treating Namibia with the utmost respect. We're desperate for the win.

""We'll treat every game as our last - I'm confident in the boys, they will do well,"" said Otai, who will be without injured captain and flanker Nili Latu for the game in Devon.

Veteran hooker Aleki Lutui said the team had felt let down by their capitulation to Georgia.

""It hurt inside,"" the Gloucester player said.

""Now we must move on and Tuesday night's game against Namibia is a must-win.

""We were given a big lesson last weekend, but now we hope to put smiles back on a few faces.""

Lutui added: ""Namibia can certainly play, as we saw the other night against the All Blacks.

The more than five-minute-long “Crevice/Crevasse” sits eighth in line on the ten track pummeling delivered on Matador , the ripper an excellent example of the diverse, high-energy CARVED UP style. Multiple scathing vocal attacks trample each other into the gnarly, layered riffing and pounding percussive lining, with melody and monstrosity battling each other to the death. Yet as scattered as this all sounds, the entire extensive track flows seamlessly by itself as well as within the context of the entire Matador LP. 
 Scope out the devastation CARVED UP offers on Matador with Blow The Scene’s exclusive “Crevice/Crevasse” premiere at THIS LOCATION .  
Matador is being pressed onto 140-160 gram 12” vinyl with 150 on black and 100 on oxblood and will see release through Texas-based Crowquill Records on Friday, November 13th. Preorders for the wax have been posted at THIS LOCATION . Additionally, Crowquill has procured the majority of the CARVED UP back-catalog for official digital distribution and recently set three of the band’s prior EPs through Spotify, iTunes and other digital outlets. 
 
As CARVED UP prepares for Matador to trample into the public domain, the band has been booking new gigs for the weeks ahead. Watch as the band raids a plethora of towns throughout Pennsylvania with the likes of Wailin Storms, Seer, Sovereign, Godmaker, Moon Tooth, Bardus, and more, including a Halloween show covering Snapcase’s Progression Through Unlearning LP, a radio station performance on the Lehigh Valley’s WXLV FM, several shows with their cohorts in Die Choking in November including a double record release show for both bands and more.

With angular and jagged rocked-out hardcore structures channeled through a sludge-fueled wall of amplification, the aptly named CARVED UP produces a sound that is as cutting as it is inventive, the members slicing loose all bland fodder along the way through the independent release of several successful EPs and singles. While their intense and hook-laden sound is difficult to hammer down, amassing the members’ primary and vast common influences actually does a decent job, citing Botch, Chavez, Sunny Day Real Estate, Shiner, Gospel, Young Widows, These Arms Are Snakes, and Jawbox. It’s a cranked-up, knockdown affair, which now comes boiling over in its most mutinous form yet, with CARVED UP ’s impending debut LP, Matador . With nearly forty-five minutes of purely adrenalized but ultra slick kicked-out jams, Matador packs ten ripping CARVED UP tunes, with walls of vocals, guitars and bass all layered in by TJ Schilling and Nick Norvilas atop the percussive cavalcade of Josh Cooper. Record recorded and mixed at Skylight Studio by Vince Ratti (Circa Survive, Title Fight, Turmoil) with additional recording by Will Yip, Brad Wallace, Sam Pinola, and John Fachet, Matador also sees guest contributions of cello, violin, and other noise by Greg Bortnichak and Erin Murphy of Teach Me Equals.

Scope out the devastation CARVED UP offers on Matador with Blow The Scene’s exclusive “Crevice/Crevasse” premiere at THIS LOCATION . Matador is being pressed onto 140-160 gram 12” vinyl with 150 on black and 100 on oxblood and will see release through Texas-based Crowquill Records on Friday, November 13th. Preorders for the wax have been posted at THIS LOCATION . Additionally, Crowquill has procured the majority of the CARVED UP back-catalog for official digital distribution and recently set three of the band’s prior EPs through Spotify, iTunes and other digital outlets. As CARVED UP prepares for Matador to trample into the public domain, the band has been booking new gigs for the weeks ahead. Watch as the band raids a plethora of towns throughout Pennsylvania with the likes of Wailin Storms, Seer, Sovereign, Godmaker, Moon Tooth, Bardus, and more, including a Halloween show covering Snapcase’s Progression Through Unlearning LP, a radio station performance on the Lehigh Valley’s WXLV FM, several shows with their cohorts in Die Choking in November including a double record release show for both bands and more.

While few of us are ready to embrace full-blown vegetarianism (what - no more bacon?), there's little doubt that we could all do with cutting down on our consumption of animal protein for the good of our own health and that of the planet. Meatless Monday is an idea that started in the US and has really taken off in recent years. Coming after a weekend of possible over-indulgence, it's as good a day as any to choose for a wholesome plant-based dinner.

Of course, you can prepare these simple family dinners any day of the week, and there's no need to have just one meatless meal each week. Two or three evenings a week without meat won't do anyone any harm, and by choosing better quality meat and poultry on the days that you do choose to eat it, you'll come to appreciate why the good stuff tastes so much better than the cheap processed and intensively-reared alternatives.

Vegetarians are used to being asked constantly about how they include enough protein in their diets when they don't eat meat. The answer is, of course, by making sure they eat plenty of protein-rich beans, lentils, and grains. Each of the recipes here includes protein, so there's no fear of missing out.

As well as being good for your body, eschewing meat is good for your wallet. Start including a few vegetarian meals in your weekly meal-plan and you'll notice a difference when it comes to the supermarket checkout. Keep an eye out for deals on vegetables and adapt your menus to suit what's on offer. Many vegetarian recipes, including those for curries and tagines, are very flexible in terms of which vegetables to use.

As ever, it's worth doubling up on quantities of suitable recipes so that you can pop an extra dinner into the freezer for future use, or to use for midweek lunches. The tagine will freeze well. And be sure to check your kitchen cupboard to see what ingredients you already have. I've assumed that you have olive oil, salt and pepper, but you may already have some of the other ingredients too. Pre-heat the oven to 180/fan 160/gas 4. In a roasting tin, combine the sweet potato with the onions, cumin, chilli flakes, unpeeled cloves of garlic, and the orange zest.

Add four tablespoons of oil, season with salt and toss everything together so that all the spices are well distributed.

Roast in the oven for above 35 minutes, shaking from time to time, until the sweet potatoes and onions are cooked through and starting to brown.

Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until golden brown.

Remove the soft garlic from inside its skin and combine with the rest of the oil, the orange juice and the vinegar to make a dressing.

Season with salt and pepper. Combine the spinach leaves and sweet potatoes with the dressing and top with the goat's cheese and almonds. Slice the aubergines into 1cm discs. Salt them and leave to drain in a colander for about an hour. Mince the cloves of garlic and add to the yoghurt. Season with salt and pepper. Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan until lightly coloured and set to one side. Rinse the aubergines and pat dry with kitchen paper.

Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Brush the aubergine slices with olive oil and fry in batches until golden brown and cooked through, adding a little more oil as necessary. Put to one side.

Add a little more olive oil to the frying pan and turn up the heat to high. Add the cherry tomatoes and toss briefly until they start to burst. Then turn off the heat.

Assemble the salad in a bowl by placing the warm aubergines at the bottom, followed by the yoghurt, then the hot tomatoes, the basil leaves, and the pine nuts. Serve with steamed quinoa for protein. Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, for five minutes or until soft. Add the carrot, garlic, ginger, and ras el hanout and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or until the fragrances of the spices are released.

Add the stock and bring to the boil. Add the squash, beans and apricots. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the squash is tender.

Add dates, chickpeas and lemon zest and stir to combine. Cook for another minute until hot through.

Taste, season with salt and pepper and add the juice of the lemon if you like. Divide into bowls and serve topped with a dollop of yoghurt and a few coriander leaves. Spell it how you will - hummus, houmous - the Mediterranean-style combination of chickpeas, tahini (a paste made from sesame seeds), lemon and garlic has become a staple in many Irish kitchens over the past decade. It makes a speedy lunch on oat crackers, a fine addition to a mezze selection and a great accompaniment to lamb cooked with Middle Eastern flavours. This week we test six of the most readily available variations on the theme, to see if price makes any difference to quality. This hummus has a chunkier texture than the others we tested and there's a fine aroma of garlic when you peel off the plastic film that keeps it fresh. The flavour is good and it tastes wholesome and authentic. Pleasant texture that isn't completely smooth. A well-flavoured hummus with good balance at a keen price. This one looks as if you might have made it yourself and although there's good texture and the flavours of garlic and lemon, it's light on the tahini. Tasty, but the price is a bit hefty. Not enough garlic for our taste but the tahini comes through well and there's a good lemony hit. Pretty good. Quite a solid texture and bland-tasting, this hummus is by no means unpleasant and would be fine in a wrap with falafel or other strongly flavoured ingredients.",1053,"really taken off in recent years.

Meatless Monday is an idea that started in the US and has spread to 71 countries by the end of this year. Global vegetarianism was caused by Communist Party rule in the 1970s and the mass slaughter of animals.

A country needs to be a vegetarian country rather than an outcast with a growing economic and social situation.

The most notable change from what you're eating today comes into play when people say ""meat."" The problem? People have a hard time describing 'Meat' or anything resembling its exact context unless they realize your definition puts them off their diet altogether; some meatheads think vegans can go through much less calories than humans without any kind about how those parts actually relate up front: eat out regularly so as not too hungry while still supporting family members who might find themselves sitting right next door if someone shows evidence beyond prying eyes during meals which would seem suspiciously tame were vegan friends like me asking one another my personal secret words I kept hearing back online until recently... Well really…there appears enough confusion surrounding whether vegetarians feel similar restrictions should cover every dietary decision made by everyone else but also be able afford access insurance within three months after getting around certain rules because many consumers just don´t"

649958,77aa8dec-f32d-4a56-816f-ec3f37cb9bc9,Battle lines drawn in Hamilton ridings,Inside Halton,"If you haven't paid attention so far, don't worry: there are still just over six weeks to go. 
 

                            We're not even at the halfway point of a marathon federal election that stumbled out of the blocks in early August.  
 

                            The summer doldrums have drawn to a close, and for many voters and candidates, the campaign jumps into high gear Tuesday. But with 43 days until the election, candidates still have more time to reach voters than they did during 2011's entire 37-day contest. 
 

                            More than 50 per cent of voters have likely already decided whom they'll support, McMaster political scientist Henry Jacek figures. But elections, especially tight ones, are won by swings of a few percentage points, he says. 
 

                            ""There still is a lot of possibility of change."" 
 

                            That's true for Hamilton.  
 

                            In some ridings, challengers will find it hard to unseat longtime incumbents. 
 

                            But not all are immune to shifting political sands. That's especially the case where electoral lines have been redrawn.  
 

                            On paper, the battle for the new riding of Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas (HWAD) is wide open without a sitting MP to bump. 
 

                            The Mountain is also incumbentless with NDP MP Chris Charlton retiring from federal politics. 
 

                            In Burlington, seen as a Tory stronghold, the winner isn't a sure thing, either, Jacek says, noting the riding swung Liberal in the last provincial election. 
 

                            When leaders drop in to rally the troops, it's a good indicator that parties don't believe the riding is in the bag. 
 

                            This week, visits to Hamilton and Burlington were telling. 
 

                            Federal Conservative Leader Stephen Harper promised to make Burlington an advanced manufacturing hub. MP Mike Wallace carries the blue banner there. 
 

                            The prime minister has also stopped by Conservative MP David Sweet's campaign office as he makes his bid in newly hewn Flamborough-Glanbrook. 
 

                            NDP Leader Tom Mulcair already visited HWAD, and Harper and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau are likely to show up as well, Jacek predicts. 
 

                            In a tight race, every riding counts. And for many, this race is too close to call. 
 

                            Chris Cochrane, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto, calls it the ""most unpredictable election in my living memory."" 
 

                            The Tories must maintain their seats and make inroads in the 905 area code, a central battleground of suburbia and medium-sized urban centres, he says.

                            To make matters worse in Hamilton, U.S. Steel is pulling its high-value steelmaking out of the city. This is four years after the company inked a deal with the Harper government that guaranteed jobs and production levels in exchange for permission to buy Stelco. 
 

                            Meanwhile, Hamilton, like other urban centres, is calling on Ottawa to come up with new revenue-raising tools to help tackle a massive infrastructure deficit characterized by pothole-pocked roads and ancient water pipes. 
 

                            Another deficit is in affordable housing. Anti-poverty activists are trying to keep the city's social housing crunch on the federal agenda. Nearly 6,000 households are on the municipal waiting list.

                            Cochrane, the University of Toronto expert, says the national narratives, such as mounting Senate scandals, will not fade as the campaign grinds on. 
 

                            The pundits and pollsters will continue to remind voters who might have snoozed through the Mike Duffy fraud trial, for example.

 Ridings in brief*  
  
 Flamborough Glanbrook  
 

                            The Conservatives are hoping to hit their traditional rural pay dirt in this freshly drawn agricultural riding.  
 

                            In 2011, David Sweet, easily won a third term in the now-defunct Ancaster-Dundas-Flamborough-Westdale, making him the only Tory MP in the city. 
 

                            Sweet is taking on Liberal Jennifer Stebbing, a lawyer, and New Democrat Mike DiLivio, an electrician. 
 
 Hamilton Centre  
 

                            New Democrat David Christopherson nailed down his fourth federal victory in 2011 with solid 57 per cent of the vote in the sprawling lower-city riding. 
 

                            Liberal rival Anne Tennier is taking a second shot at the officialOpposition's deputy leader, who locked up the riding in 2004 when he dispatched Grit MP Stan Keyes. 
 

                            Tennier, a business executive, joins lawyer Yonatan Rozenszajn, who's carrying the Conservative banner, and hypnotherapist Ute Schmid-Jones of the Green party in a tough bid to unseat the incumbent. 
 
 Hamilton East-Stoney Creek  
 

                            The Liberals hope former Hamilton mayor Bob Bratina has enough hometown political appeal to repaint the riding red. 
 

                            He'll have to knock off three-time New Democrat MP Wayne Marston, who has a habit of trouncing high-touted Liberal rivals. 
 

                            Marston stole the riding from Liberal candidate minister Tony Valeri in 2006 and dismissed former mayor Larry Di Ianni two years later.  
 

                            Last time around, he fended off former city councillor Brad Clark, who was running for the Tories. Diane Bubanko, a former political aide to a Mississauga MP, is carrying the Conservative banner in this contest. 
 
 Hamilton Mountain  
 

                            Of all the Mountain hopefuls, city Coun. Scott Duvall has the greatest name recognition in a riding that's voted NDP since 2006. 
 

                            Duvall aims to extend the orange streak now that incumbent Chris Charlton is bowing out of federal politics. 
 

                            The Liberals are going with Catholic elementary school teacher Shaun Burt. The Conservatives are betting on Allan Miles, who ran last fall in the public school board trustee race. McMaster student Raheem Aman is the Greens' candidate. 
 
 Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas  
 

                            It's another new riding, but they're not campaign newbies. Three candidates vying for HWAD have sought political office in previous contests. 
 

                            New Democrat Alex Johnstone, public school board trustee, has run provincially; Liberal Filomena Tassi, a high school chaplain and former Catholic trustee, has also sought provincial office; Perennial Green party veteran Peter Ormond has tossed his hat into provincial and federal rings. 
 

                            Conservative hopeful Vincent Samuel, a retired health-care professional, is the electoral rookie of the bunch, who are all banking on not having to face an incumbent with Sweet opting to run in Flamborough-Glanbrook. 
 
 Burlington  
 

                            Conservative Mike Wallace is seeking another term in the riding he's locked up since 2006. It's a key beachhead for the Tories, who have trouble winning in Toronto but have made inroads in the 905 area.  
 

                            Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave a hint of Burlington's strategic value by visiting Laurel Steel earlier this week, pledging to contribute $30 million to an advanced manufacturing hub in the city. 
 

                            Before Wallace, the well-heeled riding was Liberal Paddy Tornsey's stomping ground for 13 years. First-time Grit hopeful Katrina Gould, a trade and investment specialist, hopes to bring it back into the Big Red Tent.  
 

                            New Democrat David Laird, a Children's Aid worker and CUPE local vice-president, is taking another stab at Burlington, where he's lost to Wallace a few times. 
 
 Oakville North-Burlington  
 

                            This is a wide-open race in a brand-new, vote-rich 905 riding. 
 

                            Coun. Pam Damoff is stepping in for the Liberals after candidate Max Khan's untimely death in March. The former Oakville city councillor was 46 years old.  
 

                            Effie Triantafilopoulos, a former provincial candidate, is the Conservative candidate; New Democrat Janice is a labour union leader and Green party candidate Adnan Shabaz works in curriculum support for the public school board.  
 
 Haldimand-Norfolk  
 

                            Conservative incumbent Diane Finley wants a fifth ride in territory she's claimed since becoming an MP in 2004. 
 

                            It will be tough to unseat the experienced cabinet minister, but the riding's landscape isn't so rosy these days.  
 

                            Haldimand-Norfolk has been dispirited by ailing U.S. Steel fortunes at Lake Erie Works while municipal officials battle sizeable company tax-rebate claims. 
 

                            Lawyer Joan Mouland is running for the Liberals, Trillium Railway founder Wayne Ettinger is the Green party candidate and school board trustee John Harris represents the NDP. 
 
 Niagara West-Glanbrook  
 

                            In 2011, Dean Allison won by a landslide in this rural riding that includes Binbrook and Grimsby.  
 

                            The MP has made the area a Tory stronghold since 2004, when he was first elected. 
 

                            He faces Liberal challenger Phil Rose, an adjunct York University communications professor who also taught at McMaster. Nameer Rahman, a Grimsby-based policy analyst, is running for the NDP.

                            Official polling day",2003,"Henry Jacek figures. But elections, especially tight ones, are won by swings of a few percentage points, he says. ""There still is a lot of possibility of change."" That's true for Hamilton. In some ridings, challengers will find it hard to unseat longtime incumbents. But not all are immune to shifting political sands. That's especially the case where electoral lines have been redrawn. On paper, the battle for the new riding of Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas (HWAD) is wide open without a sitting MP to bump. The Mountain is also incumbentless with NDP MP Chris Charlton retiring from federal politics. In Burlington, seen as a Tory stronghold, the winner isn't a sure thing, either, Jacek says, noting the riding swung Liberal in the last provincial election. When leaders drop in to rally the troops, it's a good indicator that parties don't believe the riding is in the bag. This week, visits to Hamilton and Burlington were telling. Federal Conservative Leader Stephen Harper promised to make Burlington an advanced manufacturing hub. MP Mike Wallace carries the blue banner there. The prime minister has also stopped by Conservative MP David Sweet's campaign office as he makes his bid in newly hewn Flamborough-Glanbrook. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair already visited HWAD, and Harper and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau are likely to show up as well, Jacek predicts. In a tight race, every riding counts. And for many, this race is too close to call. Chris Cochrane, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto, calls it the ""most unpredictable election in my living memory."" The Tories must maintain their seats and make inroads in the 905 area code, a central battleground of suburbia and medium-sized urban centres, he says. ""I don't think there would be too many areas of the country that would be sort of more central to the Conservative planning than Hamilton, for example."" But Liberal-NDP votes aren't likely to bleed to the Conservatives, Cochrane says. ""The big wild card here is the second choices. There's a lot of soft support, if you will, for both the Liberals and the New Democrats, but almost none of that soft support could potentially benefit the Conservatives."" In 2011, it was a different story. Jack Layton's New Democrats crested their ""orange wave"" in Quebec, decimating the Bloc Québécois to displace the dismally led Michael Ignatieff Liberals as the official Opposition. Harper capitalized on the Liberal and Bloc implosions with the backdrop of a sound economy. Now, it's flagging, having entered recession territory. To make matters worse in Hamilton, U.S. Steel is pulling its high-value steelmaking out of the city. This is four years after the company inked a deal with the Harper government that guaranteed jobs and production levels in exchange for permission to buy Stelco. Meanwhile, Hamilton, like other urban centres, is calling on Ottawa to come up with new revenue-raising tools to help tackle a massive infrastructure deficit characterized by pothole-pocked roads and ancient water pipes. Another deficit is in affordable housing. Anti-poverty activists are trying to keep the city's social housing crunch on the federal agenda. Nearly 6,000 households are on the municipal waiting list.

'45 Badgers were a team to remember 
By Javier Morales 
The Arizona Daily Star 

In the eventful year of 1945, Franklin Delano Roosevelt passed away, Harry S. Truman took over, and the Japanese surrendered in World War II. 

Closer to home, and far from the tension of the real world, Tucsonans were treated to the exploits of the young Gridleymen. 

Weel after week in the fall of 1945, backers of the Gridleymen — coach Rollin T. Gridley's Tucson High School football team's — became entranced by the team's success. In a time of uncertainty, the team offered Tucsonans a release. The city was theirs. 

In bold letters, headlines atop the sports page read, ""Tucson High Badgers Romp"" and ""Tucson High Crushes Another Opponent."" Occasionally, reports about the Badgers ran adjacent to war coverage on the front page of the newspaper. 

Overflow crowds in excess of 13,000 would file into Arizona Stadium to watch the Gridleymen face another likely victim. 

Large caravans would travel to the Phoenix area to watch Tucson play the likes of St. Mary's, Phoenix Union and Mesa. 

A sea of red and white, the team's colors, was noticeable wherever the Badgers played. 

Tucson High monopolized local fan interest for a variety of reasons. 

Amphitheater, a new school situated on the western edge of the city back then, was the only other high school in town. 

The University of Arizona football program resurfaced in 1945 after a two-year break because of World War II, and it took a while for fans to kindle faith in the Wildcats. The Badgers drew larger crowds. 

A winning tradition enhanced Tucson's devotion to the Badgers. The seniors — the class of 1946 — never lost a game in their varsity career. 

Tucson achieved a 32-game winning streak, and it was the undisputed state champion in 1944 and 1945. A state playoff system did not exist, and since the Badgers were unbeated in those years, they were declared champs. 

The team featured the likes of reserve quarterback Frank ""Brain"" Borman, halfback Karl Eller, and starting quarterback Lee ""Legs"" Carey. 

Each accomplished fame or fortune after graduating from Tucson High, and they lended credence to the Class of 1946 being called the Class of Champions. 

Borman piloted the Gemini 7 space mission in 1965, and three years later, he was the commander of the Apollo 8 mission. It was the first manned spacecraft to circle the moon. 

Eller ius a prosperous entrepreneur who onnce owned the circle K Corporation and currently owns the Swenson's Ice Cream chain. He was one of the original owners of the Phoenix Suns, and he was president of Combined Communications, one of the nation's largest mass media enterprises that eventually was purchased by the Gannett Co. 

Carey, whom Gridley calls one of the most legendary athletes to attend Tucson High, played professional baseball in the Cleveland Indians organization for almost a decade. Today, he holds an administrative position at the UA. 

Over the weekend, they and others from the Class of 1946 gathered to celebrate a 45th reunion. It was a time to reminisce about the old days when they were the toast of Tucson. 

Times have changed, but their bond remains strong. 

""That team in 1945 had character,"" said Borman, who has settled in Las Cruces, N.M., after a 10-year stint as chairman of Eastern Airlines. At 63, he flies aerobatic planes in his spare time and works with a company that issues licenses for lasers. 

""The only real naturally gifted athlete on the team was Lee Carey,"" Borman said, ""and even he did not play on the collegiate level. It was just a group of guys who were very dedicated. 

""Coach Gridley was responsible for our success. He's a man who changed all of our lives and was a positive influence. I mean that."" 

Gridley, 88, lives in Tucson and continues to follow football on all levels. He played for the UA in 1925-26 and was a teammate of John ""Button"" Salmon, whose phrase ""Bear Down"" has become legendary. 

Gridley said the 1945 edition of the Badgers embodied the noble characteristics of Salmon. Many years have passed, but he can remember details. 

He likes to talk about how Borman replaced Carey at quarterback early that season after Carey suffered a fractured wrist. Borman operated the T-formation offense without a glitch. 

Gridley cannot forget when Carey returned to action late in the season and ran for 197 yards on three carries against Phoenix Union. 

He does not hesitate to speak of the time Tucson defeated Mesa in the final game of the season and shut down famed running back Wilford ""Whizzer"" White. 

""What a wonderful group of young men,"" Gridley said. ""They were a bunch of individuals who were determined to not lose. It's hard to compare, but I would say that team was very well one oo the best teams I ever coached."" 

Borman and Eller, at the outset of the 1945 season, did not figure to play a prominent role. Although they survived a tryout that consisted of many aspirants, neither was listed as a starter. But by the end of the season, they shared in the team's glory along with the headliners Carey, Art Pacheco and Oscar Carrillo. 

""I was just a 150-pound fullback, but I did not let my size stop me,"" said Eller, who continued his football career at the UA from 1949-51. ""I backed up the line pretty well. All of the guys were strong. 

""We had a lot of guts, stamina and spirit. Everyone knew how to clock and tackle. We were good kids. That reflects on Coach Gridley. He's the finest individual I've come across. He has so much integrity."" 

Forty-six years later, the Gridleymen continue to think of their glory during a time when the world was unsettled. Tucsonans had something to smile about. A gala 50th reunion, a golden anniversary of the class of 1946, is in the works for five years from now. 

The event will provide yet another opportunity to reminisce about the splendor of yesteryear. 

Borman did, indeed, make it to space twice. The first time, it was the longest space mission to date, lasting 14 days.

Borman's Parents 'Proud' 
Phoenicians Fly To Cape For Launch 

By Jim Strothman 

CAPE KENNEDY AP—Proud parents are Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Borman. Their son, Frank, will be command pilot inside the Gemini 7 capsule. 

""We both feel wonderful,"" said the astronaut's gray-haired father. ""We sure are proud of our son."" 

""We're real exicted,"" agreed Mom. ""I have great confidence and think it's going to be a wonderful thing for Frank. I hope it can go the full 14 days and everything turns out just right."" 

The Bormans flew to Cape Kennedy from their home in Phoenix, so they could watch their boy blast off on the longest manned space adventure yet undertaken. 

For the Borman clan, it was family day. 

""My sister and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William Robertson, who live at Far Hills, N.J., are coming,"" Frank's mother said. 

The Tucson astronaut's blonde wife, Susan, and his two sons, Frederick, 14, and Edwin, 12, also flew to Cape Kennedy to observe the launch. Susan's mother, Ruth Bugbee, also of Tucson, Ariz., also will be on hand. 

Borman visited briefly with his parents Friday morning. Borman's wife ate dinner with him Thursday night, and then avoided newsmen. 

Susan and the sons, ""don't seem excited,"" the astronaut's mother said. ""She's lovely and the boys are terrific. But that's Grandma talking,"" she quipped. 

Marilyn Lovell, wife of Borman's copilot, Navy Cmdr. James A. Lovell Jr., stayed in Houston because she is expecting their fourth child to be born late this month, possibly while Lovell is orbiting the globe.

Apollo 8 Crew Starts Journey Back To Earth 
Astronauts Will Land Friday 

By Paul Recer 
AP Aerospace Writer 

SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) — The Apollo 8 spaceship and its crew blasted away from the neighborhood of the moon Christmas Day — and began the 235,000-mile trip home. 

""Roger,"" said Apollo 8, ""We've just been informed there is a Santa Claus."" 

There were six frightening minutes while Apollo Control tried repeatedly to get voice contact with the spacecraft. 

Then it was there. 

The rocket firing came at 11:00 a.m. Tucson time, and 10 minutes later Apollo wheeled out from behind the moon homeward bound at about 6,000 miles per hour. 

The three-minute 18-second burn added enough speed to the 3,600 m.p.h. Apollo 8 was traveling to carry it away from the moon's primary gravitational influence, and send it into the pull of the earth. 

""This gives you the sensation that you're climbing,"" Apollo 8 reported when confirmation of a good rocket burn was passed up to the spaceship. 

Earlier, the ""very tired crew"" of the Apollo 8, with the first flush of their space victory behind them, cut down their Christmas Eve flight plan — but kept a television transmission in their moon-orbiting schedule. 

Asked about a computer problem, spacecraft commander Frank Borman said his co-pilot, James A. Lovell Jr., ""got screwed up on one of those programs. So he's getting kinda tired here."" Before that turn of events, Borman had offered a Christmas Eve prayer Tuesday for peace ""to people everywhere."" 

Apollo 8 commander, Air Force Col. Frank Borman, said the prayer as the spacecraft whipped around the glimmering moon's surface for the third time. 

Borman and his crewmates, Air Force Maj. William A. Anders and Navy Capt. James A. Lovell Jr., had injected themselves into moon orbit at 4:59 a.m., EST Tuesday, becoming the first men to ever explore another celestial cody from close range. 

They sped over the surface in an orbit of 70 by 196 miles and then fired the powerful service propulsion rocket engine to circularize their path over the moon at 70 by 70. The crew stunned the world with a television transmission during their second orbit. A second television transmission, scheduled for 9:28 p.m. EST, was expanded from the scheduled 15 minutes to 37 minutes. 

The crew fired service propulsion engine the first time to slow their spacecraft enough for it to settle into moon orbit some 69 hours after their Saturday launch at Cape Kennedy. 

The firing came as the spacecraft whipped around the backside and passed from contact with the earth. Mission controllers waited a chilling 22 minutes before Apollo 8 reappeared from behind the moon and reported all was well. 

The crew described the lunar surface, took pictures to help later Apollo crews who will land there, and named previously unnamed craters for each other. 

""It looks like plaster of paris, or sort of a grayish beach sand,"" said Lovell of the barren moonscape. 

Anders called the surface ""Whitish-gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints in it."" 

the trio beamed back to earth — a shimmering blue broad crescent 220,000 miles away — their first 12-minute telecast of the moon. 

It showed a desert of peaks and craters and millions of miles of pocked wasteland. 

Like an ancient mapmaker gazing on unknown landmarks, Anders tried to put a name on them. 

""We're passing over crater Borman right now. Lovell's right next to it and Anders right next to it,"" the 35-year-old Air Force major said. 

Lovell brought laughter from his crewmate when he observed, ""don't those two craters look like a pickax striking concrete and leaving a lot of fine space dust."" 

Lovell said small impact craters contained centered dark spots where it appeared meteorites hit and ""buried in and hit some new material below that's got a lot of fine, white dust."" 

The 40-year-old Navy camptain picked out landmarks leading up to the first prime landing site for later missions and said he found it easy to navigate over the surface of the moon. 

""It's almost impossible to miss, he said. ""Very easy to pick out. I can see very clearly the five-cratered star formation which we had on our lunar chart."" 

He also said he easily found a triangular mountain which was one of the primary guiding marks of his navigation exercise. He had said before the flight he would name the lunar peak Mt. Marilyn"" for his wife. 

The navigation points Lovell looked for were just to the right of the line where dark and light collide on the moon's surface as earthly viewers would look at it. The points are located in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. 

Maintaining their calm military precision throughout the awesome first minutes of lunar orbit, the crew gave a technical readout on the health of their spacecraft before giving the eargerly waiting world a description of the moon's surface. 

Lovell observed that the lunar craters are ""all rounded off — there's quite a few of them."" 

He said many :look like they've been hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort ... The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven terraces on the way down.""

Borman's wife ate dinner with him Thursday night, and then avoided newsmen. Susan and the sons, ""don't seem excited,"" the astronaut's mother said. ""She's lovely and the boys are terrific. But that's Grandma talking,"" she quipped. Marilyn Lovell, wife of Borman's copilot, Navy Cmdr. James A. Lovell Jr., stayed in Houston because she is expecting their fourth child to be born late this month, possibly while Lovell is orbiting the globe. From the Arizona Daily Star, Wednesday, Dec. 25, 1968: Apollo 8 Crew Starts Journey Back To Earth Astronauts Will Land Friday By Paul Recer AP Aerospace Writer SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) — The Apollo 8 spaceship and its crew blasted away from the neighborhood of the moon Christmas Day — and began the 235,000-mile trip home. ""Roger,"" said Apollo 8, ""We've just been informed there is a Santa Claus."" There were six frightening minutes while Apollo Control tried repeatedly to get voice contact with the spacecraft. Then it was there. The rocket firing came at 11:00 a.m. Tucson time, and 10 minutes later Apollo wheeled out from behind the moon homeward bound at about 6,000 miles per hour. The three-minute 18-second burn added enough speed to the 3,600 m.p.h. Apollo 8 was traveling to carry it away from the moon's primary gravitational influence, and send it into the pull of the earth. ""This gives you the sensation that you're climbing,"" Apollo 8 reported when confirmation of a good rocket burn was passed up to the spaceship. Earlier, the ""very tired crew"" of the Apollo 8, with the first flush of their space victory behind them, cut down their Christmas Eve flight plan — but kept a television transmission in their moon-orbiting schedule. Asked about a computer problem, spacecraft commander Frank Borman said his co-pilot, James A. Lovell Jr., ""got screwed up on one of those programs. So he's getting kinda tired here."" Before that turn of events, Borman had offered a Christmas Eve prayer Tuesday for peace ""to people everywhere."" Apollo 8 commander, Air Force Col. Frank Borman, said the prayer as the spacecraft whipped around the glimmering moon's surface for the third time. Borman and his crewmates, Air Force Maj. William A. Anders and Navy Capt. James A. Lovell Jr., had injected themselves into moon orbit at 4:59 a.m., EST Tuesday, becoming the first men to ever explore another celestial cody from close range. They sped over the surface in an orbit of 70 by 196 miles and then fired the powerful service propulsion rocket engine to circularize their path over the moon at 70 by 70. The crew stunned the world with a television transmission during their second orbit. A second television transmission, scheduled for 9:28 p.m. EST, was expanded from the scheduled 15 minutes to 37 minutes. The crew fired service propulsion engine the first time to slow their spacecraft enough for it to settle into moon orbit some 69 hours after their Saturday launch at Cape Kennedy. The firing came as the spacecraft whipped around the backside and passed from contact with the earth. Mission controllers waited a chilling 22 minutes before Apollo 8 reappeared from behind the moon and reported all was well. The crew described the lunar surface, took pictures to help later Apollo crews who will land there, and named previously unnamed craters for each other. ""It looks like plaster of paris, or sort of a grayish beach sand,"" said Lovell of the barren moonscape. Anders called the surface ""Whitish-gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints in it."" the trio beamed back to earth — a shimmering blue broad crescent 220,000 miles away — their first 12-minute telecast of the moon. It showed a desert of peaks and craters and millions of miles of pocked wasteland. Like an ancient mapmaker gazing on unknown landmarks, Anders tried to put a name on them. ""We're passing over crater Borman right now. Lovell's right next to it and Anders right next to it,"" the 35-year-old Air Force major said. Lovell brought laughter from his crewmate when he observed, ""don't those two craters look like a pickax striking concrete and leaving a lot of fine space dust."" Lovell said small impact craters contained centered dark spots where it appeared meteorites hit and ""buried in and hit some new material below that's got a lot of fine, white dust."" The 40-year-old Navy camptain picked out landmarks leading up to the first prime landing site for later missions and said he found it easy to navigate over the surface of the moon. ""It's almost impossible to miss, he said. ""Very easy to pick out. I can see very clearly the five-cratered star formation which we had on our lunar chart."" He also said he easily found a triangular mountain which was one of the primary guiding marks of his navigation exercise. He had said before the flight he would name the lunar peak Mt. Marilyn"" for his wife. The navigation points Lovell looked for were just to the right of the line where dark and light collide on the moon's surface as earthly viewers would look at it. The points are located in an area called the Sea of Tranquility. Maintaining their calm military precision throughout the awesome first minutes of lunar orbit, the crew gave a technical readout on the health of their spacecraft before giving the eargerly waiting world a description of the moon's surface. Lovell observed that the lunar craters are ""all rounded off — there's quite a few of them."" He said many :look like they've been hit by meteorites or projectiles of some sort ... The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven terraces on the way down."" Frank Borman is one of Tucson's notable achievers.","Former astronaut Frank Borman wasn't born in Tucson, but we consider him one of our own. He grew up in Tucson and went to high school here.

Hidekichi Miyazaki, a father of four and grandfather of 10, completed the 100-meter sprint in 42.22 seconds on Wednesday, entering the record books as the world's oldest competitive sprinter.

""I slept very well last night,"" he told CNN Thursday. ""I was really moved that something like this can happen.""

Miyazaki's daughter Kiyono added her father had not been sleeping well leading up to this year's Kyoto Masters competition, experiencing pain in his legs.

In addition to sprinting, Miyazaki also competed in the shot put event at the Kyoto Masters, marking 3.25 meters.

Post-retirement hobby

Miyazaki didn't take up track and field until the age of 93 -- more than three decades after he retired from working in an agricultural cooperative, Kiyono told CNN.

He spent the previous 33 years practicing calligraphy and playing Japanese chess with his friends. But as they started to die from old age, he wanted to find something he could do on his own, Kiyono explained. 

That was track and field.

Miyazaki first completed the 100-meter dash at the Kyodo Masters in 2004, when he was 96 years old. It was then that he started imitating the trademark pose of Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man.

He does it because ""it's cool,"" he said.

Serious trainer

Even at his age, Miyazaki takes training very seriously. He practices every day, except when it's raining, in a nearby park, his daughter said. He does a 100-meter sprint and practices throwing shot put three times.

Miyazaki said he runs because it's good for his health, he says, ""and for a gold medal.""

Kiyono said the doctor has told her father that it's too much for someone his age, but he refuses to listen.

""He is an amazing individual,"" said Kenji Iwanami, Secretary-General of the Kyodo Masters competition. ""His mind is clear and he manages his condition perfectly.""

A plunge of 190 points in one day has wiped some $55 billion off the Australian sharemarket, reducing revenue to Canberra, rocking confidence, and underscoring the urgency of the economic reform task confronting new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. As Mr Turnbull summoned business, union, and community leader to Canberra on Thursday for a mini-summit aimed at revitalising the reform conversation around company tax, as well as GST, retirement incomes, and education, Australia's heavily resource-based economy was given a timely reminder of its vulnerability to world markets, the declining role of the mining sector, which led the falls, and the urgent need to create new wealth across a broader base.

In a day of trading widely described as a ""bloodbath"", the benchmark index slipped to 4925.6, to be 3.8 percentage points lower than a month ago, taking it to a fresh two-year low.

That is down about 18 per cent from its recent highs in April. The Australian dollar continued to hold up amid the carnage finishing just below 70¢ US.

It was the worst day on the market since August 24, when the ASX200 closed 4.1 per cent lower, and the lowest point it has hit since July 2013.

Nonetheless, some analysts felt the sell-off - driven largely by a 30 per cent fall in UK-listed mining giant Glencore - was a little overdone with CMC chief markets strategist Michael McCarthy calling it a ""classic sharemarket panic"".

Mr Turnbull has called eight of the lead participants in last month's National Reform Summit to discuss ideas raised with a view to identifying areas of common ground. Among these are a consensus on a lower company tax rate, changes to high-end superannuation tax concessions, and the replacement of so-called inefficient taxes such as stamp duties, with more efficient and nationally consistent land taxes.

There is also the prospect of a further discussion around the GST, although unions, many crossbench MPs, and the opposition, remain opposed to that in principle due to the disproportionate impact on low income earners.

It came as the government continued to weather the political aftershocks of its September 14 leadership showdown, with defeated former prime minister Tony Abbott using his first radio interview to defend his record, and claim that no economic policies nor even the phrasing around them had changed.

However Treasurer Scott Morrison has confirmed that previously rejected proposals, such as curbs on superannuation tax concessions for the well-off, could be considered after all because all suggestions are back on the table in a post-Abbott atmosphere he characterised as ""an opening up"".

""There has been, I think, an opening up of what is being prepared to be considered,"" Mr Morrison said.

""We want to look at the system, and anything, any idea, that is going to encourage Australians to work more and work effectively and work more productively, that is going to save more effectively for their future ... we're not into the rule-in-rule-out game on the features, we know what the benefits need to be and if there are measures that are going achieve those benefits, great, let's look at them.""

With the government treading a fine line between protecting its economic core on the one hand and justifying the leadership change on the other, Mr Morrison described Mr Turnbull's Thursday meeting as ""a good opportunity"" to bring considered collective views together.

""We should always be listening, I mean that's what good governments do, they're always listening,"" he told Sky News.

""They've got a large number of people together ... this is a good opportunity for them to bring their considered collective views directly and discuss it with the senior ministers in the government.

""One of the most important things I think together we can accomplish is this, whether it's particularly the tax system, where they've had a lot of discussion about that, how do we take the Australian people with us about the sort of changes that we need to make to the tax system that actually will boost economic growth going forward?""

He said the problem for the budget was not one of revenue but of spending, the answer to which was stronger growth.

""I want the economy to earn more. Now that's obviously taken some hits with movements in commodity prices and things of that nature, that will impact your earnings,"" he predicted.

One of the participants at Mr Turnbull's meeting, Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox, described it as ""a chance to kickstart discussions around developing a serious reform agenda to turn Australia into a leading edge 21st century economy"".

""If there is not acceptance from all participants that the current economic model needs to be retooled so we can refocus our relatively slow and low growth economy, it will be a wasted opportunity,"" he said.

""Old thinking won't cut it anymore. To globally compete, our high-cost economy needs to put innovation at its fore to encourage start-ups and investment in new technologies and provide incentives for world-class research and development while making adjustments to increase efficiencies and maintaining our record of fairness.""

In one of the worst days of selling on the ASX, investors responded to weakening demand from China and the prospect of an end to the cheap-money era provided by the US Federal Reserve.

According to the Bloomberg index of commodity futures, values have fallen 50 per cent since a 2011 high, revealing the days of the full-blown resources boom are over.

SIBU: A shopkeeper has been openly selling protected pangolins in front of his shop near the night market here for the last 10 years. 

The man told reporters yesterday that he had lost count of the number of pangolins he has sold in that time. 

“Because of its good ‘medicinal value’, the demand for pangolin is high,” he said, adding that the scaly mammal was sold for between RM30 and RM100 per kg. 

He openly declared that he is aware that pangolins are protected under the Wild Life Protection Ordinance 1998. 

“Due to its ‘rich medicinal value’, the demand is always there and supply will never be able to meet the demand,” he said. 

When contacted, a Sarawak Forestry Corporation spokesman stressed that pangolins are protected under Section 29 of the Ordinance. 

Anyone found guilty of hunting, killing, keeping, selling, buying, or eating pangolins can face up to a year in jail and fined RM10,000. 

The shopkeeper’s deed was brought to light by a concerned citizen, who photographed the open sale of a mother pangolin and its tiny baby at the night market on Wednesday around 5.30pm. 

The photographs were then posted on annamiticus.com — the website of an educational non-profit organisation working to stop the economic exploitation of endangered species based in the United States. 

The posting called for justice, calling on those who recognised the man to contact local authorities so that the pangolins have a chance to be rescued and the responsible parties brought to justice. 

Both mother pangolin and baby were apparently quickly snapped up.

169398,d0504160-939c-46c5-9fd6-61b53a7076bf,Bernie Sanders Gets a Foreign Policy,Global Research,"After  25,000 people  asked, Senator Bernie Sanders  added a few words  to his presidential campaign website about the 96% of humanity he’d been ignoring. 
 
He did not, as his spoken comments heretofore might have suggested, make this statement entirely or at all about fraud and waste in the military. He did not even mention Saudi Arabia, much less declare that it should “take the lead” or “get its hands dirty” as he had been doing in interviews, even as Saudi Arabia bombs Yemeni families with U.S. cluster bombs. While he mentioned veterans and called them brave, he also did not turn the focus of his statement toward glorification of troops, as he very well might have. 
 
All that to the good, the statement does lack some key ingredients. Should the United States be spending a trillion dollars a year and over half of discretionary spending on militarism? Should it cut that by 50%, increase it by 30%, trim it by 3%? We really can’t tell from this statement insisting on the need for major military spending while admitting the harm it does: 
 
And while there is no question our military must be fully prepared and have the resources it needs to fight international terrorism, it is imperative that we take a hard look at the Pentagon’s budget and the priorities it has established. The U.S. military must be equipped to fight today’s battles, not those of the last war, much less the Cold War. Our defense budget must represent our national security interests and the needs of our military, not the reelection of members of Congress or the profits of defense contractors. The warning that President Dwight David Eisenhower gave us about the influence of the Military-Industrial Complex in 1961 is truer today than it was then. 
  
That warning, of course, might be interpreted by some as suggesting that investing in preparation for “today’s battles” is what produces today’s battles. 
 
And which of today’s battles would Sanders like to end? Drones are not mentioned. Special forces are not mentioned. Foreign bases are not mentioned. The only hint he gives about future action in Iraq or Syria suggests that he would continue to use the military to make things worse while simultaneously trying other approaches to make things better: 
 
We live in a dangerous world full of serious threats, perhaps none more so than the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. Senator Sanders is committed to keeping America safe, and pursuing those who would do Americans harm. But we cannot combat international terrorism alone. We must work with our allies to root out terrorist funding networks, provide logistical support in the region, disrupt online radicalization, provide humanitarian relief, and support and defend religious freedom. Moreover, we must begin to address the root causes of radicalization, instead of focusing solely on military responses to those who have already become radicalized. 
  
Would he end the U.S. war on Afghanistan? 
 
Sen. Sanders called on both Presidents Bush and Obama to withdraw U.S. troops as soon as possible and for the people of Afghanistan to take full responsibility for their own security. After visiting Afghanistan, Sen. Sanders spoke-out against the rampant corruption he saw, particularly in regards to elections, security and the banking system. 
  
From that, an American suffering under the delusion that the war had already been ended would be enlightened not at all, and one really can’t tell whether Sanders would choose to take any sort of action to end it in reality. Of course, he is a U.S. Senator and is not attempting to cut off the funding. 
 
Sanders’ statement is a very mixed bag. He supports the Iran agreement while pushing false claims about “Iran developing nuclear weapons.” He criticizes “both sides” in Palestine, but says not one word about cutting off free weaponry or international legal protection for Israel — or for any other governments. The Pope’s call to end the arms trade, which the United States leads, goes unmentioned. He mentions nuclear weapons, but only the nonexistent ones belonging to Iran, not those of the United States or Israel or any other nation. Disarmament is not an agenda item here. And how could it be when he declares, in violation of the U.N. Charter, in his first paragraph that “force must always be an option”? 
 
Sanders offers no details on a shift away from serving as weapons supplier to the world, to serious investment in aid and diplomacy. But he does say this: 
 
However, after nearly fourteen years of ill-conceived and disastrous military engagements in the Middle East, it is time for a new approach. We must move away from policies that favor unilateral military action and preemptive war, and that make the United States the de facto policeman of the world. Senator Sanders believes that foreign policy is not just deciding how to react to conflict around the world, but also includes redefining America’s role in the increasingly global economy. Along with our allies throughout the world, we should be vigorous in attempting to prevent international conflict, not just responding to problems. For example, the international trade agreements we enter into, and our energy and climate change policies not only have enormous consequences for Americans here at home, but greatly affect our relations with countries around the world. Senator Sanders has the experience, the record and the vision not just to lead on these critically important issues, but to take our country in a very different direction. 
  
Sanders claims, however, absurdly, that he has only supported wars that were a “last resort.” He includes among those, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia, despite neither having been remotely a last resort. Sanders admits as much, saying, “I supported the use of force to stop the ethnic cleansing in the Balkans.” Set aside the fact that it increased the ethnic cleansing and that diplomacy was not really attempted, what he is claiming is a philanthropic mission, not a “last resort.” Sanders also says, “And, in the wake of the attacks on September 11, 2001, I supported the use of force in Afghanistan to hunt down the terrorists who attacked us.” Set aside the Taliban’s offer to transfer Osama bin Laden to a third country to be tried, what Sanders is describing is hunting and murdering people in a distant land, not a “last resort” — and also not what he voted for, and Rep. Barbara Lee voted against, which was a blank check for endless war at presidential discretion. 
 
All of this obviously leaves open the possibility of endless global war but suggests a desire not to eagerly seek it out. Also obviously it is far better than Hillary Clinton would  say , less than Jill Stein would  say  (“Establish a foreign policy based on diplomacy, international law, and human rights. End the wars and drone attacks, cut military spending by at least 50% and close the 700+ foreign military bases that are turning our republic into a bankrupt empire. 
 
Stop U.S. support and arms sales to human rights abusers, and lead on global nuclear disarmament.”), and a bit different from what Lincoln Chafee would say (the latter actually  admits  the U.S. wars created ISIS and are making us less safe, says he’d end drone strikes, etc.). And of course the whole lot of them are a distraction from the struggle to reduce and end militarism and prevent wars in 2015, a year with no election in it. Still, it’s encouraging that a leading “socialist” candidate for U.S. president finally has a foreign policy, even if it hardly resembles Jeremy Corbyn’s.",1261,"turn the focus of his statement toward glorification of troops, as he very well might have. All that to the good, the statement does lack some key ingredients. Should the United States be spending a trillion dollars a year and over half of discretionary spending on militarism? Should it cut that by 50%, increase it by 30%, trim it by 3%? We really can’t tell from this statement insisting on the need for major military spending while admitting the harm it does: And while there is no question our military must be fully prepared and have the resources it needs to fight international terrorism, it is imperative that we take a hard look at the Pentagon’s budget and the priorities it has established. The U.S. military must be equipped to fight today’s battles, not those of the last war, much less the Cold War. Our defense budget must represent our national security interests and the needs of our military, not the reelection of members of Congress or the profits of defense contractors. The warning that President Dwight David Eisenhower gave us about the influence of the Military-Industrial Complex in 1961 is truer today than it was then. That warning, of course, might be interpreted by some as suggesting that investing in preparation for “today’s battles” is what produces today’s battles. And which of today’s battles would Sanders like to end? Drones are not mentioned. Special forces are not mentioned. Foreign bases are not mentioned. The only hint he gives about future action in Iraq or Syria suggests that he would continue to use the military to make things worse while simultaneously trying other approaches to make things better: We live in a dangerous world full of serious threats, perhaps none more so than the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. Senator Sanders is committed to keeping America safe, and pursuing those who would do Americans harm. But we cannot combat international terrorism alone. We must work with our allies to root out terrorist funding networks, provide logistical support in the region, disrupt online radicalization, provide humanitarian relief, and support and defend religious freedom. Moreover, we must begin to address the root causes of radicalization, instead of focusing solely on military responses to those who have already become radicalized. Would he end the U.S. war on Afghanistan? Sen. Sanders called on both Presidents Bush and Obama to withdraw U.S. troops as soon as possible and for the people of Afghanistan to take full responsibility for their own security. After visiting Afghanistan, Sen. Sanders spoke-out against the rampant corruption he saw, particularly in regards to elections, security and the banking system. From that, an American suffering under the delusion that the war had already been ended would be enlightened not at all, and one really can’t tell whether Sanders would choose to take any sort of action to end it in reality. Of course, he is a U.S. Senator and is not attempting to cut off the funding. Sanders’ statement is a very mixed bag. He supports the Iran agreement while pushing false claims about “Iran developing nuclear weapons.” He criticizes “both sides” in Palestine, but says not one word about cutting off free weaponry or international legal protection for Israel — or for any other governments. The Pope’s call to end the arms trade, which the United States leads, goes unmentioned. He mentions nuclear weapons, but only the nonexistent ones belonging to Iran, not those of the United States or Israel or any other nation. Disarmament is not an agenda item here. And how could it be when he declares, in violation of the U.N. Charter, in his first paragraph that “force must always be an option”?

Arsene Wenger has never beaten Jose Mourinho in a league game and has not come tops in a league game against Chelsea since 2011

These five things Wenger must do to win this game

1 Start Theo Walcott

Arsene Wenger should start Walcott over his favourite Olivier Giroud Walcott in my opinion is a better striker than Giroud who offers nothing to the team

With Walcott in the Arsenal team Mesut Ozil and Santi Carzola are more efficient in the team as have options of who to pass the ball to when in possession

Walcott has 11 league goals from 1 starts that start should be enough to get him on the starting team

2 Gabriel Paulista

Arsene Wenger should not make the mistake of playing his vice captain Per Mertesacker in the game against Chelsea

The tall German has been out since their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on August 16

In his absence Gabriel has shown why he should be preferred to Mertsacker in the Arsenal starting 11

He posses the strength and pace not to be troubled by any striker

With the likes of Eden Hazard and Diego Costa for Chelsea Gabriel is the right man to stop them

3 Be physical

Its high time Arsenal start standing up for themselves It's the same thing all over again Once an opposition get physical against them they lose the plot

Against Chelsea Wenger's men should really compete with their opposition in everything

Physicality tackling the referee standing up to their opponents in any given situation

This is not time to be intimated Be dirty and win your points

4 Be tight at the middle to avoid counter attacks It's something everybody knows about Arsenal

Leave them with the ball to pass around purposelessly and striker them at the counter

The likes of Francis Coquelin Santi Carzola and the full-backs should be careful when bombing forward

5 Forget about the midweek defeat in the UCL Arsenal's woeful midfield performance against Dinamo Zagreb in the UEFA Champions League should be forgotten by the players

They have been pretty solid before that show of shame in Europe on Wednesday they need to forget about that game pick themselves up and go for it all against Chelsea

829827,e14cde56-eb4a-4620-bf86-9add383d5e73,49ers' defense has some leaks to plug,Paradise Post,"SANTA CLARA -- Trent Baalke rolled up his sleeves and knew how to help Eric Mangini, which in this case meant climbing under the kitchen sink and fixing the drain. 
  
It was the late 1990s, when their NFL careers were just beginning with the New York Jets. Baalke was starting out as a scout, and he often visited the home of Mangini, who was a defensive assistant on Bill Parcells' staff. 
  
""My wife and I bought a house -- I can't fix anything -- and Trent would come over and say, 'I can take care of this. Don't worry about it,'"" Mangini said. ""He has an amazing ability to do that stuff, a hidden talent."" 
  
Now it's payback time. Mangini, as the 49ers new defensive coordinator, must fix a leaky defense. The 49ers have lost a slew of mainstays and now will rely on homegrown talent discovered by Baalke, their fifth-year general manager. 
 
 
  
The 49ers' first test comes in Monday night's season opener against the Minnesota Vikings, who are led by running back Adrian Peterson and quarterback Teddy Bridgewater. 
  
Mangini's defense figures to be more aggressive than recent 49ers versions. Instead of minimal blitzes, Mangini might just throw the kitchen sink, if you will, at the Vikings. 
  
""We don't know what to expect with these guys,"" Bridgewater said on a media conference call. ""They have a new coaching staff, different personnel. Coach Mangini, I believe, hasn't called plays since 2005 on defense."" 
  
That's correct, when Mangini was the New England Patriots defensive coordinator, a post he left to become head coach of the Jets (2006-08) and then the Cleveland Browns (2009-10). Mangini then pursued new challenges, first as an ESPN analyst and then joining the 49ers offensive staff in 2013. 
  
""Anyone you talk to will say Eric is a very cerebral coach,"" Baalke said during training camp. ""He understands the game, understands how to teach the game. How he has grown, like anybody, is through years of experience. 
  
""The two years on offensive side of the ball has really helped him, because he's learned from the other. ....it allows you to see things through a different lens."" 
  
Mangini served as a a senior offensive consultant in 2013 and the tight ends coach last season on then-coach Jim Harbaugh's staff. 
  
""On offense, it was a wonderful learning experience,"" Mangini said. ""But the comfort level here (on defense), I'm fluent in this language. This world makes complete sense."" 
  
The 49ers' defensive world got turned upside down this offseason. Justin Smith, Patrick Willis and Chris Borland retired, while starters Chris Culliver, Dan Skuta and Perrish Cox left in free agency. Then came last month's blow, with pass-rusher extraordinaire Aldon Smith getting released after his fifth arrest since 2012. 
  
Those left on defense have embraced Mangini's scheme filled with aggressive assignments and deceptive moves. If this revamped unit succeeds, Mangini will have reestablished his reputation as a defensive maestro, perhaps resurrecting the ""Mangenius"" moniker, if you will. 
  
Bridgewater said the Vikings have studied Mangini's time with the Jets, Browns and Patriots - regions where Mangini still hasn't sold his homes. As for Mangini's impact on the 49ers, Bridgewater noted: ""We've only had preseason tape to judge them, and we know some teams don't show everything in preseason. They're going to be surprises for us Monday night."" 
  
However this season evolves, Mangini has defined what he wants from his defense: ""I want it to be tough, smart, sound and aggressive."" You know, just like how Baalke worked magic at the Mangini household years ago. 
  
-- Aldon Smith's signing Friday with the Raiders was met with a positive reaction from Tomsula, a month after the 49ers released the outside linebacker amid more off-field turmoil. 
  
""Listen, all I or anybody here would want for Aldon is a great life,"" Tomsula said. ""I would feel confident saying that about this whole organization and everybody in that locker room. All we want is what's best for him. We want him to have a great life."" 
  
The 49ers, upon dismissing Smith on Aug. 7, said they'd continue to offer Smith support for any personal issues. Did he follow-up on that? ""That's his business and I'm not going to get into any of that, out of respect,"" Tomsula said. 
  
-- Monday Night Blackout? Fans are expected to receive black T-shirts, complementing the 49ers' new alternate black uniforms that will be unveiled. ""Obviously it's neat, it's cool and the guys like it,"" said Tomsula, who also dons black garb which he quipped is ""slimming."" 
  
-- Will Australian Jarryd Hayne suit up and play? Tomsula still wouldn't reveal who the 49ers will deploy as their return specialists. ""I tell you what, if I was in Australia, I'd have the NFL package and be watching every football game I could watch, because I just love football and know it's a great game,"" Tomsula said. 
  
-- Levi's Stadium's new sod will be inspected by Tomsula on Sunday. Kicker Phil Dawson and punter Bradley Pinion already have practiced on it. 
  
-- Cornerback Tramaine Brock (hamstring) has been listed as limited in practice. ""I feel really good about him. We're trying to be smart and ready to go,"" said Tomsula, who declined to name his starting cornerback unit.

Speaking at a meeting of Kingsley Parish Council, chairman Ken Unwin said the issue had been ongoing for 12 months and was getting worse.

He said: ""How do we deal with this? It is very wet across Glebe Road and access to the recreation ground can be ankle deep in mud.

""Water is also running down the road into people's gardens.

""We have been pressing Severn Trent for some time but have not got a satisfactory answer. However one of their employees has been helpful to enable us to get it back on the agenda.

""A team has now been out and taken away samples. This has shown that the water is highly likely to be ground water.

""They have also looked at manholes with cameras and placed dye down them.

Severn Trent have also checked the drains. There is also now no evidence there is a problem with the sewer.

""Therefore the conclusion is that the problem is ground water, so it is not a Severn Trent problem.""

Councillor Ivor Lucas said: ""Water is not going into the ground. Severn Trent have also checked High Street. There is however a faint oil trace running with it. The position does not change if it is raining or not.""

Councillor Malcolm Sales said: ""It has to be drained or a separate drain made into a ditch. We need to look at the drain maps for the area.""

Mr Unwin added: ""We could ask the lengthsman to look at it and then do an exploratory dig to see if there are any ruptured pipes or drains.""

Councillors agreed to obtain a drain map and also get the lengthsman to obtain an exploratory dig.

It was also brought to the council's attention that some trees had been planted without permission on the recreation field. At a previous meeting a decision had been made that the trees should be felled.

Now councillors agreed to write to all householders in High Street, whose properties back onto the field, stating that the trees would be felled.

184584,db5d9f3c-47d6-4097-9d2c-f4a0610a6b00,Labi Siffre Sings “Watch Me”,The Delete Bin,"Listen to this track by British singer-songwriter, poet, essayist, and all-around musical genre defier Labi Siffre. It’s “Watch Me”, a single on the Polydor label released onto the UK charts with a top thirty placement in 1972. That year, he would also release his third album, Crying Laughing Loving Lying. Before his recording career as a solo artist began in the 1970, Labi Siffre was a jobbing musician in the jazz clubs of Soho in London in the 1960s. His music would be delivered in two separate stages. First, he would put out six albums from 1970 to 1975. Later, he would retire as a recording artist, only to return in the mid-eighties, and make four more records by the end of the nineties. His work would be covered by acts ranging from Madness, who had a top ten hit with Siffre’s “It Must Be Love”, to Rod Stewart who would record “Crying Laughing Loving Lying”. His music has since been sampled by Eminem, Kanye West, Jay Z, and Primal Scream. In this early part of his career, he would become known in England as a writer of great depth and dimension to be compared to many of his contemporaries who had come out of similar scenes including Joan Armatrading, Cat Stevens, and Al Stewart. This song is a prime example of what he was able to do; write towering love songs full of beaming optimism without any hint of soppiness or hackeyed sentiment of any kind. He would also make a point of breaking down all kinds of barriers, both of a musical and of a personal nature. Labi Siffre specialized in writing songs about human connection that went above and beyond the work of many at the time. This is one of them, a shimmering gem that has an almost childlike quality, balanced against its mature lyrical eloquence. Musically, it touches on a strain of folk-jazz, with a hint of psychedelia, thanks to Siffre’s acoustic guitar lines adorned in layers of phasing that give the whole song a dreamlike quality. This is not to mention his voice, which is a keening tenor that carries a hint of Sam Cooke, while also being distinct without the comparison. During a time when diversity was not as well integrated or accepted in Britain as it arguably is today, Siffre was openly gay, the visible son of immigrants, and an atheist. His work on this song and on others is a celebration of love and acceptance during a time when it was commonly believed that gay men were nothing more than social deviants. As such, Siffre’s songs have a certain social undercurrent and importance. Even this awareness of the times is secondary to his sense of artistry. On this song, it is love that is the strongest force there is to stand in an unjust world. It also communicates a certain optimism, as well as a lightness in tone and feel. It is an invitation to intimacy and to connection to another, as well as to one’s own identity. It is a celebratory and life-affirming statement no matter what the sexual orientation, gender, or cultural background. But, it has a particular value to those having to conceal their natures in a culture that was not ready to accept that love know no cultural boundaries. “Watch Me” reveals that art doesn’t have to be po faced and solemn to be important or powerful, and that love songs can be political, and still be primarily about the love of another, and love of self: Watch me when I’m on my own
See me falling like the snow
Come and be the things you are
I am still falling, but not quite so far “Come and be the things you are” in particular in a powerful line, an act that was not quite so easy then for Siffre and for those who had had to hide themselves in order to avoid persecution, unable to love whom they chose in the open. For many in many parts of the world, it is not so easy now, either. But besides all that, “come and be the things you are” is at the heart of every relationship we seek, no matter who we are. If ever their was a secret to a happy life, surely this is it. Labi Siffre is a songwriter, performer, speaker, and writer today.  You can learn more about him by visiting his official site, which includes his blog. You can even follow him on Twitter!

With his Silicon Valley visit, Modi’s supporters plan to hold a “rock star” reception aimed at rehabilitating his image as a pogrom-tainted politician.
AJA members will be sharing inconvenient facts about Modi’s record that his PR team wants to hide — on the environment, religious rights, civil rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ equality, the safety of Dalit and adivasi communities, and beyond.

Publication Date: June 30, 2015 Format: eBook Source: Provided by the Xpresso Book Tours and the author in exchange for an honest review
A satisfying category romance from Entangled’s new Lovestruck imprint…
Love thy sexy jerk of a neighbor…
CEO Michael Anderson might be something of a “control freak.” Still, he’s not quite sure why his therapist thinks dogsitting will fix anything—especially since he and the canine share a kind of mutual loathing. And to make matters worse, a house sitter moves in next door disrupting his peace—and his dates—with the worst possible music at the worst possible time… every time.
Free-spirited artist Mia Argaropolis has settled into the perfect gig—housesitting in NYC’s Upper West Side while working as an art therapist. Too bad she’s stuck living next door to a bossy control freak with a penchant for calling building security when she blasts music to drown out the noises coming through his bedroom wall.
Post-apocalyptic dinner rolls that nearly take her kitchen with them, a douchebag ex, and a Shih Tzu with the personality of Godzilla attack Mia in one day, and her unlikely neighbor comes to the rescue. Like it was her fault. And now, somehow, they find themselves engaged? Both agree, this neighborly feud just got taken to a whole new level. This is the type of romance I can't get enough of. NWB was sexy, hilarious and written to perfection. I consumed the entire book within a day and was a bit peeved when it was over. Now I'm thinking I need to read the first book in the series, just to get my next fix. I loved both of our MCs the moment I met them. Michael and Mia were complete opposites and that was apparent from the start. Their first face to face interaction was hilarious and does horribly wrong just as expected. But the chemistry was there right from the jump and I loved it. I like how they were both extremes–one extremely strict and sensible and the other extremely scatterbrained and kind of silly. I loved this pairing just as much as I would have had they been exactly alike and butting heads at every turn. Wait, Michael and Mia did butt heads at every turn and it was hilarious. They were both justified in the way they felt most of the time, which made this book that much better and I think the sexual chemistry is what made their arguments that much more childish and adorable. This book was hot without being pornographic. I don't mind dirty books, in fact, I love them but this book might have been ruined if it was too dirty. The focus was clearly on building a strong relationship between Michael and Mia that wasn't based on sex. Because this book dances in the realm of insta-love, the author was very smart to take this route and keep the porno play down to a minimum. It made the love story believable even though it went from hate to love rather quickly. The writing was fantastic. Clarke writes with an easy flow that you don't see very often. Every sentence fit perfectly with the one before and after it and the book was just a pleasure to read over all. The author's sense of humor shined through and I'm very interested in reading Sleeping with the Boss and the next one in the series that is supposed to come out this year. I hope the humor element is not diminished in the other books because it's probably my favorite part. This was a fun read and I highly recommend it. There's really nothing bad I can say about this book. It was adorable and I'm super glad I got a chance to read it. If you're looking for a quick read that packs a very sexy punch, then I recommend NWB. Can't wait to read more!

Seven of these surveys have been released over the course of the month, and only one - the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index - has exceeded economists' expectations. 

All of these regional surveys pointed to shrinking manufacturing sectors, with some prints coming in at their worst levels since the Great Recession: 
 
Bloomberg 
 
The Empire State manufacturing index earlier this month  indicated back-to-back months of contraction , with the employment sub-index and six-month forward outlook hitting multi-year lows. In part due to a market retreat in new order volumes, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Survey posted its lowest reading since the start of 2013. The Kansas City Fed's index has been stuck in negative territory since March, with new orders, shipments, employment, and exports all declining in September. 

On Wednesday, two more regional indices confirmed that the pain is widespread. 

The ISM Milwaukee Purchasers Manufacturing Index sank to its lowest level since 2009 with a reading of 39.44, with new orders declining at a more precipitous rate than August's reading:

Meanwhile, the MNI Chicago Business Barometer Report dipped into contractionary territory at 48.7, with new orders and production falling:

This softness in the sector came amid another upwards move for the Fed's U.S. trade-weighted broad dollar index, which hit its highest level since 2003 during the month. A loftier dollar makes American manufactured goods less attractive to foreign buyers. 

We'll get more data soon as on Thursday, two national surveys on the state of the U.S. manufacturing industry, the Markit PMI and ISM PMI, are slated to be released. The consensus estimate is for these surveys to come in at 53 and 50.6, respectively. 

Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro, doesn't believe the weakness in some of these regional surveys are surefire signs that September's national surveys will come in below 50, a level that suggests the sector has shrunk. 

""What is important to note is that Chicago has been a fairly poor indicator of the direction of the ISM, particularly, over the past few months giving the market false signals,"" he wrote. ""The market is positioned now for a fairly weak ISM report, which we think could be on the wrong side of the risks."" 

The good news in all this? Manufacturing isn't nearly as big a part of the U.S. economy as it once was, and all indications are that services sectors are still humming along at a robust clip.

""They ate dinner right over there,"" said Chancellor George Blumenthal, addressing a capacity crowd of 750 revelers, and pointing in the direction of the nearby East Field House. ""And here we are, eating in a tent! But I'm sure they didn't eat as well as we're eating tonight."" 
 
Blumenthal was right about that. The 21,600-square-foot tent in question stood in floodlights on the East Field overlooking Monterey Bay, and the food in question was fresh and organic haute cuisine in a menu designed by legendary chef Alice Waters, with 120 cooks and waitstaff preparing and delivering it to the tables. 
 
Dinner entertainment by local arts organization Tandy Beal & Company had diners cheering and gasping at the sight of artists leaping through balanced hoops and performing other feats of agility and strength. 
 
They also watched a film presentation that took them right back to the possibility and excitement of 1965. 
 
The speakers kept a strong focus on how much ground the students and professors have covered over the years, and the achieving of seemingly impossible goals. Chancellor Blumenthal spoke of the people who rose to meet the challenge of the organically grown strawberry and the quest to map the human genome. But it was also an evening with light touches and surreal and sublime moments: diners mingling with performers dressed whimsically as peacocks, bears, and giant birds, a juggler beckoning people toward their seats. 
 
Big, bold, quirky 
 
The grand celebration was meant to be a big and bold but quirky statement: UC Santa Cruz has come a long way from its humble roots but it has not abandoned its creativity and iconoclastic spirit. The evening's entertainment—Tandy Beal & Company's gravity-defying, pole-climbing, limb-contorting dance troupe, performing alongside a capella group SoVoSó—illustrated that spirit. So did the evening's keynote speaker and Foundation Medal honoree Alice Waters, the celebrated chef and food activist who spoke of her kindred spirit with UC Santa Cruz, and in particular its pioneering Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. 
 
Someone yelled ""Go Alice!"" as the food impresario took to the podium. Waters drew loud cheers after she made a sly joke about the Fiat Fifty logistics early on in her presentation, noting that she ""never liked eating in a tent, but you've put on the greatest show on Earth."" 
 
She continued by saying she resonates with the work being done at UC Santa Cruz, ""an institution that has nurtured me and is really close to my heart, an institution that still expresses so many of the values I cherish and I fight for every day."" She noted that Chez Panisse opened its doors in 1971, the same year the farming program started at UC Santa Cruz. 
 
She had special praise for alumni who have been ""on the forefront of the (food) movement, who paved the way"" for farmers, teachers, cooks, community activists, and policymakers who learned the power of connecting with the land from this campus. Among them, she singled out Drew Goodman of Earthbound Farm, professor and researcher V. Ernesto Mendez, Greens Restaurant founding chef Deborah Madison, and Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson, otherwise known as The Kitchen Sisters. 
 
Earlier in the day, Waters toured the 33-acre UC Santa Cruz farm and visted with apprentices in the CASFS Ecological Horticulture program before having luch at the Alan Chadwick Garden where organic agriculture project first began on campus in 1967. 
 
Waters, who had a candid conversation about life and food with UC Santa Cruz's Review magazine this summer, also praised the dedicated UC Santa Cruz students who work at the Homeless Garden Project in town. 
 
""I don't think it can be overemphasized that UC Santa Cruz and Chez Panisse were born in the free speech movement,"" she said. Those currents fed both the intellectual community on campus as well as the menu at her groundbreaking restaurant. 
 
True originals 
 
The evening was also a time to celebrate the original students, staff, and faculty members who took such bold risks and helped establish UC Santa Cruz as an intellectual powerhouse at a time of cultural and political foment. 
 
A special Fiat Lux Award was accepted by Hal Hyde, founding vice chancellor of business and finance, and emeriti faculty members John Dizikes and Jean Langenheim. 
 
Langenheim drew whoops from the crowd when she mentioned spending ""45 of my now 90 years"" teaching at UC Santa Cruz. She spoke of all the devoted faculty who could just not pull themselves away from the campus and kept giving it their intellectual and creative energy long after they retired. 
 
Master of ceremonies was Kathryn Sullivan (Stevenson '73, Earth sciences), the first American woman to walk in space. She told the crowd about the various ways UC Santa Cruz changed her life. 
 
""When I arrived on campus in 1969, I was horrified and annoyed at the requirement to take three science courses,"" she admitted. ""I did everything I could to get out of taking them."" But two of the professors who taught those dreaded classes—Biology Professor Todd Newberry and Earth Sciences Professor Gary Griggs—changed her life and kindled her first serious interest in science.

Cyr: John Boehner’s bombshell resignation and resulting challenges,Brighton-Pittsford Post,"John Boehner (R-Ohio) appears to have stunned everyone, including friends and allies, with his announcement on Sept. 25 that he is leaving the post of speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives – and also retiring from Congress. This concludes a tour of service in the top leadership post that has been especially difficult. Boehner is a partisan Republican but also a dedicated legislator. He has rightly taken pride in getting the job done. That has meant compromise on occasion with Democrats while working simultaneously to hold together increasingly fractious House Republicans. The Republican right wing contains zealots who can barely contain their glee that Boehner will soon be gone. The tea party may be fading as an electoral force, but the uncompromising movement remains highly influential in Congress. Their outlook is essentially narrow, shortsighted and ultimately counterproductive for their party as well as the nation. Several dozen stalwarts in the House of Representatives are fundamentally opposed to government, period. A shutdown is for them welcome, no matter how inconvenient for working people in government, and in the wider economy. Right-wing Republicans had threatened to oust Boehner if he permitted a federal budget to be passed which included funding for Planned Parenthood. Controversial videos which allege a callous attitude by that organization regarding use of fetuses greatly stoked the always emotional debate over abortion. In 2013, Republicans managed to shut down the government for sixteen days as part of the effort to derail the Affordable Care Act. Then and now, Democrats led by President Barack Obama used the Republican effort to political advantage. Boehner’s move makes a shutdown less likely. The current situation further increases the influence of House Republicans who are able to get results without open warfare with the ideologues. Congressman Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, likely will accumulate even more influence. His gracious statement describing Boehner’s resignation as “an act of pure selflessness” sets the right tone. With Republican turmoil in the House, attention turns to the Senate, and in particular the role of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky). He is rightly respected as a pragmatic and effective deal maker. Currently he is pressing a spending bill which avoids defunding Planned Parenthood and funds the federal government into December. The practice of holding the federal budget hostage to controversial partisan party maneuvers has now gone on for many years. In 1994, Republicans took control of the U.S. House of Representatives after forty years in minority status. Their majority was led by new Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Georgia), who dramatically accelerated the trend of shifting that office from a relatively nonpartisan to highly partisan pulpit. Then as now, White House Democrats and Congressional Republicans played an escalating game of budgetary chicken. The federal government was shut down briefly.

A man sentenced to life in prison will be collecting half of his ex-wife's military retirement because of Arizona community property law. He was convicted for child pornography and sexual misconduct. 

Ronald Gulli and his wife, Deanna Gulli, were married for 28 years and had two children together. Three years ago, Ronald Gulli was arrested after police said they found videos and photos on his computer of children being sexually abused. Deanna Gulli filed for divorce soon after. 

Arizona law requires Deanna Gulli, who served in the U.S. Army for 25 years, to pay half her military retirement to her ex-husband.  

""How am I going to support my children if I have to support somebody that's incarcerated?"" said Deanna Gulli. ""It's hard to believe that all I get is sympathy, but I don't get help."" 

Gulli said the money would be spent on her children's college tuition. 

""I don't have any money for them to go to college. That's their college money,” she said. “It just seems like a selfish way to lose your money.” 

Arizona is one of few states in the country with a community property law. This law ensures, if a couple decided to get a divorce, that all of the money earned while a couple is married is equally divided between spouses. There are no exceptions to law, even if one's spouse is convicted of a felony.  

""Any money that you earn during a marriage through working belongs half to each spouse. So if you contribute to a retirement plan while you're working, that retirement plan is community property,” said Jennifer Manzi, an attorney at Karp and Weiss law firm. “There aren't any exceptions and the only way that this could change is if the legislators change the law."" 

The only way Deanna Gulli can stop her husband from collecting half of her military retirement is if Arizona legislators make a proposal to amend and change part of Title 25, in order to make an exception for spouses convicted of a felony or spouse who is incarcerated for life.  

Gulli has reached out to organizations dedicated to veteran services and multiple Arizona legislators, but has been told there is nothing that can be done. ",370,"to her ex-husband.

REVIEW: I was bemoaning (to no one in particular) the fact that it had been awhile since I’ve sat myself down to watch a good old fashioned slasher flick. Then lo and behold, a movie called Run, Hide, Die showed up in my mailbox! This got me to thinking that maybe I should bemoan (again, to no one in particular) the fact that I’m not a multi millionaire that’s married to Jessica Alba – it couldn’t hurt to try. But first, I had to watch this film, and dutifully report my findings back to all of you. Nearly a year to the day when her husband was murdered, Addison (Alison Monda), decides that a little road trip to a secluded cabin with four of her best friends would be a good idea. And indeed, for awhile the five of them are having a great time. Addison, Gina (Tabitha Bastien), Ariel (Ivey Bronwen), Billy (Keiko Green) & Indy (Alicia Mendez) are merrily enjoying themselves until someone shows up with one hell of an ax to grind against them. But who exactly could this person be? And why is this person so very upset at Addison and her buds? The answer to that is one of two surprises in Run, Hide, Die, and of course I’m not going to spill that can of beans. But I will divulge the other surprise, and that one is that this film wasn’t half bad! Now that isn’t to say that this film is without its fair share of issues – its got more than a few of them. But as the story unfolded (written by star Alison Monda), I found myself fairly intrigued by what was going on. The five lead actresses have a nice, easy & natural charm that works in their favor, and they got along as if they have indeed known each other for a long time. Their interactions made the first half of the film feel very personal, and their general bawdiness was a welcome change from watching similar films with men exchanging fart/dick jokes. Mind you, the jokes do run thin after awhile, but hearing them come from women gave them a longer screen life than you’d expect. The first half of the film is surprisingly engaging. Unfortunately, the second half of the film decides to wallow in the standard tropes of the slasher film as it tries to subvert a few of them at the same time. It’s during this half that some fairly heinous seams begin to show. Once the killer decides to burst upon the scene, Run, Hide, Die seems to get confused. Since a lot of this confusion stems from who the killer is, I won’t say too much about it. Suffice it to say that here are more than a few instances during which all five of our campers in peril could have easily taken care of the killer. In one of the few nifty turns that take place in the second half, the killer gets a hold of a script for a horror film that Ariel has a role in. The killer makes the five girls act out the script, and perform some of the actions that take place in the script – actions like cannibalism. This works out for awhile, it amps up the suspense for a bit. But then the film decides to have the girls spend most of the last 30 minutes screaming incoherently at each other, and the cinematography takes a turn towards an unsavory murkiness that obscures most of what’s happening onscreen. In short, after a decent first half, Run, Hide, Die becomes decidedly irritating in its second half. But with a running time of 75 minutes, it’s all over rather quickly, and there’s still the faintest hint of that decent first half wafting over the second half. So while I can’t quite recommend that you run out to buy/rent it – Run, Hide, Die is a decent enough diversion for a slow Friday evening. Good performances by all, an interesting twist, and competent direction (from Collin Joseph Neal) help to ease the pain of the final 30 minutes. Run, Hide, Die – 2 out of 5 Shrouds.

BETHEL — After months of hearings and many testimonies, the Planning and Zoning Commission on Tuesday denied a controversial request to build a crematorium at Francis J. Clarke Business Park. 
 
A resolution denying the request, which commission members approved by a 4-3 vote, said the applicant did not demonstrate that the proposed facility would not cause harmful health effects to neighbors or that it would not decrease property values in the area. 
 
The crematorium proposal, which was filed in April, angered dozens of nearby business owners and residents who feared that smokestack emissions could pose a risk to humans and drive down the value of neighboring properties. Some business owners even threatened to move out of town and at least two of them put their properties up for sale. 
 
The commission said the proposed crematorium location was “ill-suited” also because of the required site work, which would include “excessive excavation.” 
 
The panel took nearly all of the 65 days allowed to make a decision after the closing of the five-part public hearing in July. The deadline for the vote was Wednesday. 
 
The panel also voted to repeal a regulation approved last year that opened the door to crematoriums in the business park, essentially banning such use in the future. The effective date on the ban is Oct. 1, because the town first needs to publish a legal notice in the newspaper. 
 
The applicant, Shawn McLoughlin , said he did not know Tuesday whether he would submit a revised application before that date. 
 
“We’re just going to see what happens,” McLoughlin said. “I have to talk to my lawyer.” 
 
The entrepreneur hoped to build a new facility adjacent to Mono-Crete, the pre-cast concrete business he owns on Trowbridge Drive. He said he was “disappointed” by the decision and criticized the commission’s reversed stance on crematoriums. 
 
“They led us to believe all along, certainly in the beginning, that this was going to be approved,” McLoughlin said. “Then they decided to change their mind, based on what I think were misleading statements by a few of the people who were against us.” 
 
The panel last year amended its regulations to allow crematoriums in the business park by special permit. But after several residents and business owners voiced their opposition, the commission voted to repeal the amendment in May. 
 
However, that repeal was canceled after the applicant sued the commission for making the reversal “effective immediately,” even before a newspaper notice was published. The applicant for the ban, business owner Greg Marciano , then submitted a revised request to repeal the amendment, which the commission approved Tuesday. 
 
Marciano said the decision is an “absolutely good thing” for the business park, but he’s concerned McLoughlin might try submitting a new application in the next few days. 
 
“I don’t think it’s over,” Marciano said. 
 
Paula Antolini , a Bethel resident who created a petition against the proposal, said she was pleased. 
 
“It goes to show that when the people come together, it works,” she said. 
 
In its resolution, the zoning board pointed to testimony from the town’s Economic Development Commission , which said that plans to expand the business park at the end of Trowbridge Road could be halted because of the proposed crematorium and that at least two business owners put their properties for sale because of the crematorium. 
 
“I think eventually I probably would have left too,” Marciano said.

However, that repeal was canceled after the applicant sued the commission for making the reversal “effective immediately,” even before a newspaper notice was published. The applicant for the ban, business owner Greg Marciano , then submitted a revised request to repeal the amendment, which the commission approved Tuesday. Marciano said the decision is an “absolutely good thing” for the business park, but he’s concerned McLoughlin might try submitting a new application in the next few days. “I don’t think it’s over,” Marciano said. Paula Antolini , a Bethel resident who created a petition against the proposal, said she was pleased. “It goes to show that when the people come together, it works,” she said. In its resolution, the zoning board pointed to testimony from the town’s Economic Development Commission , which said that plans to expand the business park at the end of Trowbridge Road could be halted because of the proposed crematorium and that at least two business owners put their properties for sale because of the crematorium. “I think eventually I probably would have left too,” Marciano said. noliveira@newstimes.com, 203-731-3411, Twitter: @olivnelson","Photo: H John Voorhees III / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Image 1 of 3 Pat Rist Photo: H John Voorhees III / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 2 of 3 Connecticut Coining, 10 Trowbridge Road, Francis J.Clark Business Park, Bethel, Conn, on Friday, July 24, 2014.

 (HITNEWS) – When I talked with my neighbors last week about their interest over another large mass grave plan that's taking shape around town due in part as an urban renewal project involving city officials from different areas is called 'the Burden' Plan by its developers — there were several local ""proposals"" offered even before it was announced back during January when they moved into site because these proposals required massive government dollars but had some real opposition which took hold this past weekend after public meetings made national news including FOX 25 News/Boston Globe reporter Greg Beechow calling them something down here while Reporters Without Borders praised people who supported big plans like those going forward until one day someone decided not just don't care enough or have time up front again so more money wasn`t given.' But let me be clear…. This needs serious work if we are looking towards moving future towns out where most communities will feel abandoned,"" said Mary Marie Smith Newland, cofounder Greenville Center staff attorney"

51022,ed4612c9-e50d-42ce-ba00-0459e213b69e,UK could pull out of European Convention on Human Rights - Attorney General,Yahoo! UK and Ireland,"The UK could pull out of Europe-wide human rights laws within the next five years unless reforms are made, the Government's senior law officer has indicated.

Attorney General Jeremy Wright said he did not know whether the UK would still be a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights at the end of the current parliament in 2020.

Justice Secretary Michael Gove has promised to set out this autumn the Government's proposals to scrap the Human Rights Act - which enshrines the convention in British law - and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.

Appearing before MPs, Mr Wright was asked whether he thought the UK would remain signed up to the convention at the end of the parliament.

""The honest answer to that is I don't know,"" he told MPs. ""A lot depends on what new settlement we can reach with the European convention mechanism.""

Appearing before the Justice Select Committee, Mr Wright insisted that the Government's respect for human rights did not solely depend on membership of the convention.

But he said repeated controversial rulings from judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg meant that the status quo was ""not sustainable"".

""I don't think that there is anybody, including anybody in Government, who has a serious issue with the content of the convention,"" he said

""The convention is a document that I think encapsulates some of the most fundamental human rights that we would all support and wish to continue supporting.

""But I think it's the interpretation of that document by the court in Strasbourg that has caused us the problem. It is the interpretation of that document and the Strasbourg jurisprudence that goes with that interpretation that I think this Government would wish to challenge and to seek to alter in terms of its effect on this country.

""So a lot will depend on whether or not we can reach an accommodation with the Council of Europe which means that we can gain some greater freedom in terms of the way in which the human rights convention is interpreted by the Strasbourg court than we have at the moment.""

He added: ""The status quo - which is that we receive a number of judgments from Strasbourg which don't represent what we think is a realistic and sensible view of human rights applicable to this country - that status quo is not sustainable and we have to do something about it.""

Mr Wright insisted that the UK's international reputation for upholding human rights would not be damaged if it left the convention.

""It isn't solely the maintenance of our membership of the European convention that demonstrates our adherence to the principles of human rights,"" he told MPs.

The Government's top legal adviser also defended the decision not to release details of the legal advice he gave o ver air strikes in Syria that killed two Britons. 

Mr Wright said convention meant his guidance remained confidential to allow it to be "" full and frank"". 

He told MPs: ""It means that we can give clear and more straightforward legal advice without any thought of that advice later being disclosed to the world.""

Practical reasons, such as evidence gathered from the intelligence agencies, also made it difficult to disclose, he said. 

David Cameron told the Commons last week that two British citizens, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, who were fighting for Islamic State (IS) were killed in an RAF drone attack. 

Mr Wright told the committee he had given permission for the fact he had given advice to be disclosed but that was because of the ""exceptional circumstances"". 

He added: ""You can take it that I agree wholeheartedly with the Government's legal position. 

""It's not right that Parliament should be expected to decide on this without any indication at all on the basis on which the Government took action and that's why the Prime Minister made his statement on the first day back in Parliament last Monday.

""I supported him in what he said and I agreed with what he said but I think that is different to disclosing the detail of law officers' advice, which should be preserved so that good government can be maintained.""

Mr Wright said there had to be an imminent threat for a strike to be justified and the action had to be necessary, proportionate and comply with international law.

""In all of those respects I was satisfied that this was a lawful action,"" he added.

Mr Wright refused to say if fresh advice for further strikes would need to be given on a case by case basis.

Kat Craig, legal director at human rights charity Reprieve, said: ""It is alarming that the Attorney General does not feel the need to tell MPs or the public even the most broad details about the UK's kill policy.

""All we currently know, is that the Prime Minister thinks he can authorise the killing of anyone, anywhere, without any parliamentary or judicial oversight.

""The UK appears to be going down the US route of a counter-productive, secret drone war which does more harm than good. When even US generals are warning that the drone programme causes more problems than it solves, it beggars belief that the British Government is adopting the model in full. We need a real debate, and for that we need the Government to come clean about this policy.""

Mr Wright rejected claims that the Crown Prosecution Service was on the brink of collapse but conceded that it was ""under pressure"", including from the increase in the number of sexual abuse cases.

He said: ""It is true, of course, that the CPS is under pressure. It's under pressure partly because of the caseload mix.""

Sexual offences, which are often more complex cases, have risen by 10% between 2010 and 2015, while burglary cases are down by 26% and robbery has dropped by 38%.

""But it isn't true, when you look at the statistics, that all is terrible,"" he added. 

He told MPs that the CPS conviction rate was 80% on average across magistrates and crown courts.

""I don't think that the CPS is on the brink of collapse but neither do I think that the CPS has been without its challenges over the last few years and, frankly, will not be without its challenges for the next few years either.

""That's partly unrelated to money and more to do with the kind of cases they are now having to contend with.""",1082,"Mr Wright was asked whether he thought the UK would remain signed up to the convention at the end of the parliament.

""But I think it's the interpretation of that document by the court in Strasbourg that has caused us the problem. It is the interpretation of that document and the Strasbourg jurisprudence that goes with that interpretation that I think this Government would wish to challenge and to seek to alter in terms of its effect on this country. ""So a lot will depend on whether or not we can reach an accommodation with the Council of Europe which means that we can gain some greater freedom in terms of the way in which the human rights convention is interpreted by the Strasbourg court than we have at the moment."" He added: ""The status quo - which is that we receive a number of judgments from Strasbourg which don't represent what we think is a realistic and sensible view of human rights applicable to this country - that status quo is not sustainable and we have to do something about it."" Mr Wright insisted that the UK's international reputation for upholding human rights would not be damaged if it left the convention. ""It isn't solely the maintenance of our membership of the European convention that demonstrates our adherence to the principles of human rights,"" he told MPs. The Government's top legal adviser also defended the decision not to release details of the legal advice he gave o ver air strikes in Syria that killed two Britons. Mr Wright said convention meant his guidance remained confidential to allow it to be "" full and frank"". He told MPs: ""It means that we can give clear and more straightforward legal advice without any thought of that advice later being disclosed to the world."" Practical reasons, such as evidence gathered from the intelligence agencies, also made it difficult to disclose, he said. David Cameron told the Commons last week that two British citizens, Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, who were fighting for Islamic State (IS) were killed in an RAF drone attack. Mr Wright told the committee he had given permission for the fact he had given advice to be disclosed but that was because of the ""exceptional circumstances"". He added: ""You can take it that I agree wholeheartedly with the Government's legal position. ""It's not right that Parliament should be expected to decide on this without any indication at all on the basis on which the Government took action and that's why the Prime Minister made his statement on the first day back in Parliament last Monday. ""I supported him in what he said and I agreed with what he said but I think that is different to disclosing the detail of law officers' advice, which should be preserved so that good government can be maintained."" Mr Wright said there had to be an imminent threat for a strike to be justified and the action had to be necessary, proportionate and comply with international law. ""In all of those respects I was satisfied that this was a lawful action,"" he added. Mr Wright refused to say if fresh advice for further strikes would need to be given on a case by case basis. Kat Craig, legal director at human rights charity Reprieve, said: ""It is alarming that the Attorney General does not feel the need to tell MPs or the public even the most broad details about the UK's kill policy. ""All we currently know, is that the Prime Minister thinks he can authorise the killing of anyone, anywhere, without any parliamentary or judicial oversight. ""The UK appears to be going down the US route of a counter-productive, secret drone war which does more harm than good. When even US generals are warning that the drone programme causes more problems than it solves, it beggars belief that the British Government is adopting the model in full. We need a real debate, and for that we need the Government to come clean about this policy."" Mr Wright rejected claims that the Crown Prosecution Service was on the brink of collapse but conceded that it was ""under pressure"", including from the increase in the number of sexual abuse cases. He said: ""It is true, of course, that the CPS is under pressure. It's under pressure partly because of the caseload mix."" Sexual offences, which are often more complex cases, have risen by 10% between 2010 and 2015, while burglary cases are down by 26% and robbery has dropped by 38%. ""But it isn't true, when you look at the statistics, that all is terrible,"" he added. He told MPs that the CPS conviction rate was 80% on average across magistrates and crown courts. ""I don't think that the CPS is on the brink of collapse but neither do I think that the CPS has been without its challenges over the last few years and, frankly, will not be without its challenges for the next few years either. ""That's partly unrelated to money and more to do with the kind of cases they are now having to contend with.""","The UK could pull out of Europe-wide human rights laws within the next five years unless reforms are made, the Government's senior law officer has indicated.

05:36, 2nd September 2015 
 
(RTTNews) - The Australian dollar continued to be weak against the other major currencies in the Asian session on Wednesday after data showed that the nation's economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace in the second quarter of 2015. 
 
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that Australia's gross domestic product gained a seasonally adjusted 2.0 percent on year in the second quarter or 2015. That was shy of forecasts for an increase of 2.2 percent and down from the 2.3 percent rate in the first quarter. 
 
On a quarterly basis, GDP added just 0.2 percent, also below expectations for 0.4 percent and down from 0.9 percent in the three months prior. 
 
Meanwhile, Asian stock markets traded lower, as weak U.S. manufacturing data and slowing growth in China added to worries about the global economy. Additionally, lower commodity prices also dampened investor sentiment. 
 
Tuesday, the Australian dollar fell against its major rivals, as downbeat manufacturing data out of China revived worries about the outlook for global growth. The Australian dollar fell 1.39 percent against the U.S. dollar, 1.87 percent against the euro, 2.88 percent against the yen and 0.47 percent against the Canadian dollar. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar recovered  slightly following Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to keep its official interest rates on hold at a record low 2 percent. But retreated back in a short  while. 
 
In the Asian trading, the Australian dollar fell to more than a 6-year low of 0.6981 against the U.S. dollar, a 1-week low of 1.6151 against the euro and a 6-day low of 1.1008 against the NZ dollar, from yesterday's closing quotes of 0.7013, 1.6118 and 1.1076, respectively. If the aussie extends its downtrend, it is likely to find support around 0.66 against the greenback, 1.66 against the euro and 1.08 against the kiwi. 
 
Against the yen, the aussie dropped to 83.83 from an early high of 84.34. At yesterday's close, the aussie was trading at 83.72 against the yen. This may be compared to an early 9-day low of 83.63. On the downside, 81.00 is seen as the next support level for the aussie. 
 
The aussie edged down to 0.9246 against the Canadian dollar, from yesterday's closing value of 0.9299. The aussie may test support near the 0.92 region. 
 
Looking ahead, U.K. Markits/CIPS construction PMI for August and Eurozone PPI for July are due to be released at 4:30 am ET and 5:00 am ET, respectively. 
 
In the New York session, U.S. private sector jobs data for August, factory orders for July and U.S. crude oil inventories report are slated for release.

The five-year programme by the Shannon Group’s property company, Shannon Commercial Properties Ltd, involves the construction of advance manufacturing units and office blocks as well as the upgrade of some of its existing core assets. 
 
  
 
The investment plan is focussed on delivering a stock of high quality, advanced manufacturing, warehousing and office space solutions which will aid state development agencies attract new business and jobs to the Airport and Free Zone. 
 
  
 
  
 
The €21 million first-phase over the next two years, which will support more than 250 construction related jobs, includes the redevelopment of a 12 acre site in the Shannon Free Zone. As part of the initial phase of development on this site, two projects are planned at a combined cost of in excess €10 million.  These include a 40,000 ft2 Grade A office block and a 30,000 ft2 advance technology manufacturing unit. Work on the 12 acre site has already begun with the demolition of three former manufacturing buildings of approximately 300,000 ft2 and planning applications for the two new buildings  are due to be submitted shortly. 
 
  
 
  
 
Other key projects in the first development phase include 
  A 67,000 ft2 technology manufacturing facility at Shannon Free Zone East at a cost of €6M. Work on this project has just commenced.  A €4 million upgrade and development of an existing 100,000 ft2 warehousing unit in the Zone adjoining airport lands is set to commence later this year.  A €1.3 million refurbishment of a 56,000 ft2 office and warehousing facility located in the Shannon Free Zone West is now complete.   
  
 
  
 
In welcoming the announcement, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Paschal Donohoe TD said, “This is a strategic investment not just in Shannon but in the wider region.  It’s a hugely important piece in the jigsaw for the region and having these advanced, modern facilities so close to an international airport further enhances their attractiveness. It’s a progressive move by the Shannon Group, which has clearly hit the ground running on its establishment last autumn, and bodes very well for the future.” 
Shannon Group CEO Neil Pakey said, “This investment will see our stock of quality facilities in the Shannon Free Zone significantly enhanced. Putting in place quality manufacturing and office space facilities will provide vital collateral for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland as they go about selling this region to FDI and indigenous companies.  It sends a clear signal from the Shannon Group to the market and potential investors that we are creating quality space for businesses and this, in turn, will help attract significant investment and jobs into this region.” 
Shannon Group Chairman Rose Hynes said, “This investment is in line with our strategy to redevelop Shannon Free Zone and our wider property portfolio. It will give the Shannon Free Zone a competitive edge in the national and international marketplace.  Together with our international airport, an available pool of highly skilled third level graduates, a strong motorway network and high quality of life in the west of Ireland, the Shannon Free Zone is an extremely attractive proposition for investors. This investment will serve as a catalyst to help create a further wave of employment here.” 
Ray O’Driscoll, Managing Director, Commercial Properties, Shannon Group said, “The Shannon Free Zone already hosts 120 companies in a diverse range of activities.  It has been a huge contributor to the local economy since it was established in 1959 and this first phase of what will be a major, ongoing  investment programme will bring these facilities, many of which were constructed prior to 1990, up to 21st century standards. This is an imperative to attracting major investment and jobs to the area.”

Like many fans of legendary Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki, I was devastated when the 74-year-old announced that The Wind Rises would be his last feature film. But last week, he gave everyone — including the Japanese tourism industry — a reason to cheer when it was reported he would be building a nature retreat for children. 
  
Famous for acclaimed films such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke and The Castle Of Cagliostro, Miyazaki chose the remote island of Kumejima off Okinawa to realise his vision, pumping in ¥300 million (S$3.5 million) of his own money into the project, which will be completed in 2018. According to reports, Miyazaki will also be using as much local material as possible for the retreat, which will be built by local companies in support of the Made In Kumejima initiative. 

The undertaking of his retreat is classic Miyazaki. The animator’s works often focus on children and the natural world, and he has even released a drawing of what his nature retreat would look like. 

FROM STAR WARS TO MARIO BROTHERS 

Miyazaki’s project comes in the wake of other high-profile projects that are expected to build upon the affections of die-hard fans. The Star Wars franchise, of course, takes the crown for causing the most intense case of spontaneous mass hyperventilation when Disney (which now owns Lucasfilm) announced plans last month to create not one but two Star Wars theme parks in California’s Disneyland and Florida’s Walt Disney World. 

Every bit of information, from the size of the park (about 5.5ha each) to the attractions, has been breathlessly analysed. Artist Tom Hodges, who worked at Lucasfilm for the Clone Wars comics, also sketched his take on what the parks would look like. Disney head Bob Iger assured fans they’ll be getting a Millennium Falcon ride and a Creature Cantina, based on the Mos Eisley Cantina. 

No date has been set for these just yet, but another compelling movie universe awaits next year when The Hunger Games theme park opens in Dubai.

It is definitely worthwhile to understand a bit more about these 2 'not so good' news.
a. what does the SMEs expect the government to do for them? To release the pressure of labour costs by allowing 'cheap' foreign labours AGAIN? This will be fun since this CALL comes from the SMEs directly and the government SHOULD obliged right? Or should the government just DO THE RIGHT THING and FORCED the SMEs to improve Productivity and wane themselves off the 'cheap foreign labour' addiction?
OR the government will need to be more TARGETED in the granting of 'pressure reliefs' by SPECIFIC industry among the SMEs with STRICT limitation and terms and conditions imposed? b. Is the HDB's S$2B deficit due to HDB selling its flat at 'subsidised' rate? If so, we need to understand HOW are the costs of a HDB flat built-up? Is it due to 'land cost' being valued at too high a price? Whatever the reasons, the people need to know the TRUTH so that they can be VERY GRATEFUL to the government for taking the S$2B hit by HDB for the HDB buyers!
If this deficit continued, how long can HDB do this and 'distort' the MARKET PRICE of HDB flats? If this 'subsidies' are taken away CAN Singaporean couples wanting to get married and start a 3-kid family BE able to AFFORD a HDB flat? IF NOT, does it mean that Singaporeans are really working for a fairly LOW PAY??

815163,203c7538-feb9-411b-8b55-19db2a09424b,Sri Lanka’s rupee float seen positive; more economic reforms urged,Colombo Stock Watch,"17 Sep Sri Lanka’s rupee float seen positive; more economic reforms urged by Colombo Stock Watch Sri Lanka has won a thumbs up from ratings agencies and economists for floating its rupee currency after last month’s general election, but more reforms will be needed to support the currency and conserve the central bank’s modest reserves. The rupee has fallen 4.4 percent to a record low against the dollar since it was floated on Sept. 4, extending losses suffered in a year that has seen President Maithripala Sirisena win power and form a strong government of national unity. The central bank ran down its foreign reserves by $1.4 billion in the first half of the year, leaving just $7.5 billion in ammunition to defend the currency – including a $1.5 billion swap line from India. With a heavy foreign debt burden, government officials say Sri Lanka could have to contend with further pressure on the rupee after China’s devaluation triggered a broader selloff in emerging markets currencies. “This is a move due to international currencies. Most of the emerging markets have done it. There could be a second round (of currency weakness) if the Fed raises its interest rate this week,” R.H.S. Samaratunga, the top finance ministry official, told Reuters. Analysts say while the float is positive, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake needs to deliver on plans to simplify and reduce the number of taxes, and to widen the tax net. Officials say the annual budget in November will include some tax reforms. The International Monetary Fund recently expressed concern that the Sirisena administration would struggle to meet its fiscal deficit target of 4.4 percent of GDP this year because of government hikes in wages and spending. Populist policies have often put pressure on Sri Lanka’s public finances – an issue that analysts say needs to be addressed to restore investor confidence now that the elections are over. Andrew Colquhoun, senior director at Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong, said the float was credit positive because it preserves foreign reserves. “We think the answer is partly to do with loose monetary policy so far in 2015, which has spurred credit growth and therefore sucked in imports. The focus now is on whether the new government’s economic policy strategy will strengthen Sri Lanka’s economic fundamentals,” he said in an emailed statement. Sri Lanka cut its key lending rate in April to 7.5 percent, a record low. Although consumer prices are actually falling, the loose monetary mix stoked domestic demand and boosted growth in imports to 19.4 percent, in year-on-year terms, in June. Atsi Sheth, lead analyst for Sri Lanka at Moody’s Investors Service said the rupee move would help boost trade competitiveness. “But it is negative in terms of cost of paying back debt,” she added. Sri Lanka’s foreign debt accounts for 48 percent of total government debts of 8.2 trillion rupees ($58.7 billion), putting the onus on the government to pass revenue-raising measures to stabilise the public finances.

328637,ffe6121d-d15e-40c7-97d0-633a6efb9caa,How kimchi can save your body and the planet,Rouse Hill-Stanhope Gardens News,"If we started to preserve food in little crockery jars all over the house maybe we can save the planet. 

As I'm sure my parents would have been totally stressed out trying to teach me to drive all those years ago, right now, I'm going through my rite of passage as a parent, with my son behind the wheel.

Sure, times have changed and you could say that kids have it easier these days. Today's cars have many more safety features and soon learning to drive a car may even become obsolete as self-drive cars are already proving that they can be safer.

This is little comfort as you come up to the Barton Highway for the first time. Depending on the time of day, it is hard to pick which population of drivers is the hardest to deal with.

Early morning should be quieter, but this is ""tradies hour"" when the road is full of speeding utes – sleek Holden SS Storms or the old, rattly Toyotas. We could try later, but it's packed then, and no one will ever let another car come in from a side road unless you charge out and pretty well force yourself into the line. As a learner-driver this is terrifying, but it has to be done eventually, so it's their own rite of passage to make that turn. Everything else afterwards is easy.

Likewise, it is the rite of passage of every cook, one who sees themselves as adventurous and brave, to eventually acquire their first fermentation crock. It's like the ""anti-Thermomix"", a step back in time where these vessels would have preserved the family's food reserves before refrigeration, preservatives and, the petroleum industry's gift to the world, plastics.

You don't have to be a research scientist to get the point that our increasing reliance on preservatives, genetic engineering, anti-bacterial cleaning products, fertilisers and herbicides is part and parcel of over populating the earth. However, the price we pay is increasing rates of diabetes, asthma, allergies and intolerances, heart disease, the list goes on. There are more than a few links to this diet and how it affects not only the important microflora in the soils that grow our feed but also the little bugs within ourselves, that are essential to how we process our food.

So this little crock may just be what we need to save the planet. It's sure to be a slippery slope. Next you'll be living in a VW Kombi and weaving your own sandals but I'm positive that if we got back to basics in our diet, got interested in the full story of where our food comes from and started to preserve food in little crockery jars all over the house, maybe we can do this, save the planet.

Ground-zero crock production is kimchi. You can build up to all sorts of things but just a simple vegetable fermentation is a pretty neat way ti introduce some good bacteria back to your systems. You can use any chilli if you can't find the Korean kochukara, or leave it out altogether. If you aren't into having stuff bubbling away in the pantry just buy kimchi. This very simple recipe makes a superb roast duck dinner in any case. Preserving our future: Simple kimchi is loaded with goodness. Photo:  1 large wombok (Chinese cabbage)

60-80g Murray river salt flakes

2 daikon 

2 large carrots

2 tsp sugar

1 bunch spring onions

1 head garlic

1 large knob ginger

¼ cup fish sauce

30ml soy sauce

30g Korean dried shrimp flakes

20g kochukara

Cut the cabbage in quarters lengthways, cut out the core and slice across into two-centimetre strips. Weigh these and use 30g salt per kilogram of cabbage. Mix the salt through the cabbage and cover with water. Weigh this down and leave for about three hours submerged.

Meanwhile, cut the daikon​ and carrot into a thick julienne, sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and the sugar. Let this cure for half an hour then rinse off. Cut the spring onions into two-centimetre lengths, finely dice or grate the ginger and garlic.

Once the cabbage is ready, drain and squeeze out as much water as you can. Mix everything together, adding the sauces and other condiments, working the mixture until you are sure it is fully homogenised.

Pack tightly into the crock, making sure there are no air pockets. Weigh down the top with whatever you have on hand. Within a few hours, or certainly overnight, you should have enough liquid released to cover the vegetables completely. If not, add extra water so this is the case.

Now it's a waiting game. At least three days at 20C, longer if ambient temperature is cooler but once you have the flavour and acidity at a pleasing level, pack into sterilised jars and refrigerate. Chinese roast duck: Essential ingredient for this kimchi recipe. Photo:  1 Chinese roast duck

vegetable oil

2 onions, sliced

2 cups kimchi

2-3 tbsp mirin

½ bunch spring onion, shredded

steamed rice to serve 

Separate the meat from the bones of the duck. Shred the meat and use the bones to make a quick stock by covering with water and simmering for an hour. Saute the onions in oil until very soft and just starting to caramelise, add the kimchi and enough duck stock to cover.

Bring this a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, add the cooked duck meat and heat through. Tasting the broth, it should be acidic and salty, add the mirin to balance the palate with sweetness. Depending on the kimchi this may take more or less mirin.

Serve over rice, sprinkled with spring onion.

Early morning should be quieter, but this is ""tradies hour"" when the road is full of speeding utes – sleek Holden SS Storms or the old, rattly Toyotas. We could try later, but it's packed then, and no one will ever let another car come in from a side road unless you charge out and pretty well force yourself into the line. As a learner-driver this is terrifying, but it has to be done eventually, so it's their own rite of passage to make that turn. Everything else afterwards is easy. Likewise, it is the rite of passage of every cook, one who sees themselves as adventurous and brave, to eventually acquire their first fermentation crock. It's like the ""anti-Thermomix"", a step back in time where these vessels would have preserved the family's food reserves before refrigeration, preservatives and, the petroleum industry's gift to the world, plastics. You don't have to be a research scientist to get the point that our increasing reliance on preservatives, genetic engineering, anti-bacterial cleaning products, fertilisers and herbicides is part and parcel of over populating the earth. However, the price we pay is increasing rates of diabetes, asthma, allergies and intolerances, heart disease, the list goes on. There are more than a few links to this diet and how it affects not only the important microflora in the soils that grow our feed but also the little bugs within ourselves, that are essential to how we process our food. So this little crock may just be what we need to save the planet. It's sure to be a slippery slope. Next you'll be living in a VW Kombi and weaving your own sandals but I'm positive that if we got back to basics in our diet, got interested in the full story of where our food comes from and started to preserve food in little crockery jars all over the house, maybe we can do this, save the planet. Ground-zero crock production is kimchi. You can build up to all sorts of things but just a simple vegetable fermentation is a pretty neat way ti introduce some good bacteria back to your systems. You can use any chilli if you can't find the Korean kochukara, or leave it out altogether. If you aren't into having stuff bubbling away in the pantry just buy kimchi. This very simple recipe makes a superb roast duck dinner in any case. Preserving our future: Simple kimchi is loaded with goodness. Photo: 1 large wombok (Chinese cabbage) 60-80g Murray river salt flakes 2 daikon 2 large carrots 2 tsp sugar 1 bunch spring onions 1 head garlic 1 large knob ginger ¼ cup fish sauce 30ml soy sauce 30g Korean dried shrimp flakes 20g kochukara Cut the cabbage in quarters lengthways, cut out the core and slice across into two-centimetre strips. Weigh these and use 30g salt per kilogram of cabbage. Mix the salt through the cabbage and cover with water. Weigh this down and leave for about three hours submerged. Meanwhile, cut the daikon​ and carrot into a thick julienne, sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and the sugar. Let this cure for half an hour then rinse off. Cut the spring onions into two-centimetre lengths, finely dice or grate the ginger and garlic. Once the cabbage is ready, drain and squeeze out as much water as you can. Mix everything together, adding the sauces and other condiments, working the mixture until you are sure it is fully homogenised. Pack tightly into the crock, making sure there are no air pockets. Weigh down the top with whatever you have on hand. Within a few hours, or certainly overnight, you should have enough liquid released to cover the vegetables completely. If not, add extra water so this is the case. Now it's a waiting game. At least three days at 20C, longer if ambient temperature is cooler but once you have the flavour and acidity at a pleasing level, pack into sterilised jars and refrigerate. Chinese roast duck: Essential ingredient for this kimchi recipe. Photo: 1 Chinese roast duck vegetable oil 2 onions, sliced 2 cups kimchi 2-3 tbsp mirin ½ bunch spring onion, shredded steamed rice to serve Separate the meat from the bones of the duck. Shred the meat and use the bones to make a quick stock by covering with water and simmering for an hour. Saute the onions in oil until very soft and just starting to caramelise, add the kimchi and enough duck stock to cover. Bring this a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, add the cooked duck meat and heat through. Tasting the broth, it should be acidic and salty, add the mirin to balance the palate with sweetness. Depending on the kimchi this may take more or less mirin. Serve over rice, sprinkled with spring onion. Bryan Martin is the winemaker at Clonakilla and Ravensworth.

By Seyhmus Cakan 
 
DIYARBAKIR , Turkey (Reuters) – Rising violence in southeast Turkey following the collapse of a ceasefire between the government and Kurdish insurgents will make it difficult to hold an election due on Nov. 1, the head of the pro-Kurdish opposition said on Wednesday. 
 
Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast has seen almost daily clashes between militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) and security forces since July. A bomb attack the same month, blamed on Islamic State militants, killed 30 people. 
 
The conflict with the PKK has shattered a peace process started by President Tayyip Erdogan in 2012 to end an insurgency that has killed more than 40,000 people over three decades. 
 
The fighting has intensified in the run-up to the parliamentary election that the ruling AK Party hopes will restore its single-party majority. 
 
On Tuesday, nationalist crowds attacked the office of a newspaper in Istanbul and the Ankara headquarters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party ( HDP ). 
 
A video released by the HDP showed its offices in the Mediterranean town of Alanya ablaze. 
 
“It is becoming impossible to hold an election given the security situation in the region,” Selahattin Demirtas, the head of the HDP , told a news conference in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir. 
 
“We want an election to be held and we are not saying an election can’t be held, but we want the conditions in the region to be improved for an election.” 
 
Already this week more than 40 Turkish warplanes have hit PKK targets in northern Iraq, where the group has bases, in response to Sunday’s killing of 16 soldiers near the Iraqi border, the deadliest PKK attack since the ceasefire collapsed. 
 
More than 100 members of Turkish security forces have been killed since the conflict resumed in July, based on information from government officials and security sources. Some 2,000 PKK militants have been killed, Erdogan has said. 
 
The PKK , designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and European Union, launched its separatist insurgency in 1984. 
 
93 DETAINED IN ISTANBUL 
 
In Istanbul, 93 people were detained over damage to property during nationalist protests on Tuesday night. Among buildings attacked were the headquarters of the mass-circulation Hurriyet newspaper. 
 
An AKP deputy was among the protesters outside the Hurriyet building at an initial protest on Sunday night and U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said he was concerned by reports that AKP members had encouraged protests. 
 
“Elected officials must be careful not to appear to encourage violence against media outlets,” he said. 
 
Intercity bus journeys from Diyarbakir to western Turkey were cancelled on Wednesday after buses came under attack from protesters who smashed windows with sticks and stones. 
 
Dogan news agency said many business in southern Turkey’s Manavgat district, within the Mediterranean tourism hub of Antalya, were attacked by protesters with sticks and stones for not hanging Turkish flags outside. 
 
Finance Minister Mehment Simsek said political instability posed the biggest risk to the economy, a rare admission by the AKP that politics could further hamper Turkey’s once-stunning growth. 
 
“The most important risk to the Turkish economy is long-term political uncertainty,” Simsek said at a conference in Istanbul. “It would be a recipe for budget and current account deficits.” 
 
The lira currency has hit record lows this year on political worries. Investors fear the Nov. 1 election will offer little reprieve for the economy. 
 
“If current trends persist the risk is that balance sheet strains in the economy would intensify from an already worrying level and that the political uncertainty will fester,” said Manik Narain, a London-based strategist at UBS .

The Harden Hawks Rugby League Club 2015 season wound up on Saturday night as they held their presentation night at the Harden Country Club on Saturday night.

Much interest and intrigue surrounded which way the awards would go and a healthy spread of winners illustrated the quality and depth that both the Hawks and Hawkettes teams possessed this year.

Play-maker Luke Brown was declared the best and fairest for the men’s grade, whilst Luke Stanton came equal with Nick Fuller in taking out the second and third position respectively.

** Moody's Investors Service slashed Teck Resources Ltd's
 credit to junk status, citing weak commodity prices

metallurgical coal - have suffered from the steep drop in
prices. ( bit.ly/1QexQtb )

Buddy Franklin will be missing from the Swans line-up. 
 
“This has happened pretty quickly in my eyes”. Can’t wait for you all to see the stories we are filming’. 
 
“I’ve had people say they wish they had known because they could have helped and would have liked to have helped”. 
 
Earlier in the week, Jesinta’s manager Sharon Finnigan confirmed the stunning brunette will stay put in Japan , despite her Sydney Swans’ fiance’s revelations that he will miss this weekend’s qualifying AFL final match because of concerns for his health. Within hours of the Swans announcing Franklin’s health issue, one media organisation was running a story about him collapsing last Friday, forcing the club to subsequently reveal that he also suffers from mild epilepsy . 
 
He was subsequently hospitalised but the Swans said the two conditions weren’t related. 
 
He said the news had taken him by surprise. 
 
Despite Franklin’s indifferent form of late, the news comes as a major blow to the Swans, whose ranks are already depleted in the absence of injured key players Kieren Jack and Luke Parker. 
 
“It’s a serious condition, that he needs to spend some time away from the football club, and he certainly won’t be playing this week”, Longmire said at the SCG. 
 
“You don’t have to have a lot of outcome from it (the seizure) the next day but one that ends up in a hospital and an ambulance you would expect to have an outcome”, Larkins said. 
 
“Obviously our thoughts are with Lance and we hope that he’s going to be okay”. 
 
“Hopefully he gets better soon”. 
 
Longmire stressed that Franklin’s condition was common and he was confident that he would not be looking at retiring, as was the case with former Melbourne forward Mitch Clark, who temporarily did so a year ago after he was diagnosed with clinical depression. 
 
“It’s important that, after their initial outpouring of support, we do not forget to check in with them”. 
 
The pair will fight it out for the Swans best and fairest and could well do the same on Brownlow medal night, and Kennedy believes Hannebery is a major reason behind his brilliant second half of the season. 
 
“It’s a shock to a lot of the boys”. 
 
“But I think for us and for Adam it’s just about trying to get the job done and if we can win that’s going to be the best thing we can do for him and the footy club”. 
 
“Footy is the last thing on our minds in regards to his health and all the players have spoken about it and we’re fully behind him”.

The pair will fight it out for the Swans best and fairest and could well do the same on Brownlow medal night, and Kennedy believes Hannebery is a major reason behind his brilliant second half of the season. “It’s a shock to a lot of the boys”. “But I think for us and for Adam it’s just about trying to get the job done and if we can win that’s going to be the best thing we can do for him and the footy club”. “Footy is the last thing on our minds in regards to his health and all the players have spoken about it and we’re fully behind him”.

News of changes in the cabinet have begun to leak on Sunday, ahead of new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's announcement later in the day. 

The first casualty of the shuffle was secretary to the Environment Minister, NSW Liberal MP Bob Baldwin, who took to Twitter to announce his dumping.

Kevin Andrews has been the second to lose his position, being dumped from Defence Minister 

Later on Sunday Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is expected to at least double the number of women in federal cabinet when he announces the results of his re-organisation. 

The reshuffle is one of the new Prime Minister's first major challenges, as he attempts to smooth over any rifts caused by last week's leadership spill and create a strong team. 

It was understood that although there were many considerations to take on board during the reshuffle, Mr Turnbull had prioritised the promotion of women, the Sydney Morning Herald  reported.

Despite promotions for women, Joe Hockey will lose out. 

Social Services Minister Scott Morrison has been confirmed to replace Mr Hockey as treasurer by the Herald Sun .   

Human Services Minister Marise Payne and Assistant Immigration Minister Michaelia Cash were both expected to be elevated from the outer ministry and into cabinet, it was reported. 

Also being considered for a promotion were Turnbull's supporter Kelly O'Dwyer and the conservative Concetta Fierravanti-Wells.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is expected to retain her portfolio.  

However, both are currently parliamentary secretaries and are expected to go to the outer ministry, rather than directly into cabinet. 

Previous Prime Minister Tony Abbott had been criticised for his lack of women in Cabinet, and Mr Turnbull may be seeking to use his Cabinet appointments to demonstrate his differences with the ousted leader.  
  
Treasurer Joe Hockey (left) is expected to be replaced by Social Services Minister Scott Morrison (right) when the new Cabinet is announced tomorrow 

And other former Howard government ministers such as Kevin Andrews, Ian Macfarlane, and Eric Abetz are expected to be dumped,  according to key government figures.  

The new ministry will be sworn in on Monday morning - hours before the results of the  Canning by-election are announced. 

Education Minister Christopher Pyne has been tipped  to replace Kevin Andrews as defence minister - ensuring the navy's new submarines will be built in his home state - South Australia. 
 
But Mr Andrews revealed that he wants to stay in his current position, pointing to significant upcoming decisions including the release of the new Defence White Paper.  

If he is dumped from his post,  his replacement will be the third coalition defence minister in two years. 

Attorney-General George Brandis said there is an expectation and an acceptance among ministers that there will be a cabinet reshuffle. 

But he said  he would like to stay on as the nation's top law officer. 

'I'd be happy to but of course that's entirely a matter for the prime minister,' Mr Brandis told ABC television.

Michaelia Cash has been named in ABC reports as a possible contender as Minister for Border Protection and Immigration. 

And Karen Andrews,  the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Industry and Science, told ABC Brisbane that she would like to join the cabinet on Wednesday. 

Mr Turnbull said he was 'committed' to seeing more women in positions of power and influence in parliament. 

He said: 'There is no greater enthusiast than me for seeing more women in positions of power and influence in parliament, in ministries right across the country.  

'I can assure you that I am very committed to that. I am not going to say any more about the new ministerial arrangements. You don't have long to wait.' 

He was  recently forced to brush off a  leak which shows he is the Government's worst performer in terms of Cabinet-level appointments of women to boards. 

More polls to be published early next week are tipped to return a strong result for the coalition, which has trailed Labor for the past 16 months under Mr Abbott. 

The first conducted following the rise of Mr Turnbull showed a bounce of almost three per cent. 

An expected win by the Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie in Western Australia's Canning by-election on Saturday will further boost the government. 

Labor leader Bill Shorten told reporters in Canning the one 'big loser' out of the by-election was Mr Abbott.

In 2013 the orthopaedic team conducted an audit of all deaths within 30 days and a comprehensive review of the Hip Fracture Pathway. 
 
The team then introduced a dedicated hip fracture unit to reduce the admission time from A&E to treatment, different forms of anaesthesia, a new cancellation policy to improve appointment scheduling. 
 
In addition, the team have brought in outreach support out of hours to support post op patients, a dedicated nurse specialist to help patients from admission to discharge and better access to intensive treatment unit beds. 
 
Mortality rates in the subsequent years has shown a reduction from 12 per cent in 2012/13 to 8.9 per cent in 2013/14 to 5.4 per cent in 2014/15.

 What are you sipping? 

 


Moscato. 

 If you could cherry-pick any professional hat, besides that of recording artiste, what would you be doing this very minute? 

 


Definitely something in the field of psychology. A S H I E LD agent, perhaps? I have a knack for correctly analysing people and situations. I also have a passion for helping others. It's definitely the Pisces in me! 

 What is the most surprising thing someone would discover about you? 

 


The most surprising thing? Hmm... that would have to be that I prefer a pool or river to the beach. I really don't like the feel of sand on my skin. 

 You are a new ambassador for ATL Automotive and its VW Tiguan auto. What do you love most about the ride? 

 


The question should really be what don't I love?! I named my Tiguan Tigger. He is a dream. From his panoramic sunroof, to those LED lights that greet me every single time I unlock him, it's like he's my person! I get to use Bluetooth connectivity whenever I have to use my phone so I don't get distracted and, of course, have you seen the guy, himself? He is classic, sleek, sexy and sporty all at the same time, so we make the perfect pair. 

 The way to a woman's heart is... 

 


... through time, consistency, loyalty, and diamonds. 

 If you were to make an album of duets, who would be your top-five dream collaborations? 

 


Wow! Let a girl just have a moment to dream, for sure! It would be Drake, Michael Jackson,  Kanye West, Toni Braxton, and Wiz Khalifa. 

 Who does your hair? 

 


I'm pretty OCD about people touching my hair so, if I don't do it myself, my for sure go-tos are: OXX Systems, Delsha's Hair, and Marsha Robinson's Beauty. 

 Who does your nails? 

 


Bella's Beautique, of course, for when I want the most epic nail art, which is almost always, and Martina's Nails Place, for when I'm feeling simple and classic. 

 What perfumes are you spraying? 

 


Jimmy Choo Exotic and Calvin Klein Euphoria. 

 What is your idea of the perfect man? 

 


I don't believe in perfection,  so my idea of an amazing man is an honest and ambitious one who allows me the capacity to be myself whilst becoming his queen. 

 What is your idea of the perfect date? 

 


Dinner and Moscato, or a good movie and some popcorn. 

 Taylor Swift recently restricted Apple Music from streaming her catalogue of music as she said artistes would not be compensated during the three-month trial listening period. How do you feel about independent versus corporate labels and the creative freedom the former engenders? 

 


Independent is definitely a good way to go. However, corporate labels offer the capital and capacity to do more within a shorter time frame. It all depends on your goals, what you want and how you've laid-out or visualised your journey. 

 What inspires you? 

 


Life and all its variables inspire me. I learn and grow with each new day. Just waking up means I'm given yet another chance at life, and that is inspiration enough. 

 The Jamaica Observer will celebrate its annual Take Style Out islandwide retail therapy event this Thursday, October 1. Where are your must-shop destinations? 

 


Sabritru, for sure. They literally have everything, to suit any style. If not there, then it's online for me. 

 You launched your WETswim swimwear line two years ago. What is its current status? 

 


WET, exclusive and soaring to new heights. It's doing pretty well; we still have a long way to go before I'll be comfortable, but we're on the way, and that makes me both proud and happy. 

 How would you describe your personal style? 

 


Moody. One moment I'll feel classic, and in another, sexy or edgy. One thing for sure, they almost always interwine. 

 Where and when last did you feel most fulfilled? 

 


Wow, this was just yesterday, actually. I have moments where I sit by myself and reflect. Sometimes, I give myself little pep talks, and just look back at how far I've come, how far I have left to go, how much I've learned, matured, accomplished, and how many lives I may have affected. 

 Here's a Catch-22: You've made the invitation list for the Grammy Awards but you must choose to be either a live stage performer for the night, or sit in the audience largely unnoticed as a nominee but win an award. Which of the two would you opt for and why? 

 


Anything I do in life is never for validation or accolades. I already know who I am at this point and I've always known the type of woman I wanted to be. So I don't need titles, attention or material things to validate me. The awards will come; that I am sure of. I love to sing, and performing at the Grammys would be such a huge achievement, just knowing that more people would get to see me do what  I love doing. 

 Where do you see yourself in five years? 

 


In a mystical land, far, far away, from everything negative, cooking breakfast for my husband, singing to my baby, in our dream home, with trap music blasting in the background. Cue Fetty Wap -- Come My Way.

Haddin was a peripheral figure in the recently-completed Investec Series, making the last of his 66 Test appearances at Cardiff before being acrimoniously left out of the team for the remaining three matches after missing the second game at Lord's for personal reasons, as Australia surrendered the urn following a 3-2 defeat. 
  Brad Haddin played 66 Tests, 126 one-dayers and 34 Twenty20 internationals for Australia   
The 37-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman, who retired from one-day internationals earlier this year after helping Australia to World Cup glory, has decided against attempting to earn back his Test spot and joins batsmen Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers in bowing out of the international arena following the Ashes loss. 

			 
All-rounder Shane Watson has retired from Test duty but remains available in the limited-overs formats, while paceman Ryan Harris quit the game shortly before the Investec Series got under way due to his chronic knee problem. 



 
Haddin amassed 3,266 runs in Tests, with four centuries - three of which came against England - and 18 fifties at an average of 32.98. 

His 270 dismissals behind the stumps place him behind only Adam Gilchrist, Ian Healy and Rod Marsh for Australia, all of whom played more Tests than Haddin, who was appointed vice-captain of his country in 2013. 

Australia coach Darren Lehmann led the tributes, saying: ""It's a sad day for Australian cricket, because he was a fantastic player, a fantastic mentor for a lot of young players. A great mentor for me as coach. 

""He's a fantastic human being and he'll be welcome in our change-rooms all the time, because he's an absolute superstar. 

			 
""He's done a great job for Australia and he should be extremely proud of what he's achieved on and off the cricket field."" 

Haddin had to wait until the age of 30 to make his Test debut in 2008, having been the long-term understudy to Adam Gilchrist. 

His greatest accomplishment was arguably his star turn in the 2013/14 Ashes, when he contributed 493 runs at 61.62 as Australia regained the urn with an emphatic 5-0 whitewash. 

But his form had nose-dived by the time Michael Clarke's side arrived on these shores earlier this summer and although he retained his spot for the first Test, his drop of Joe Root on nought proved a pivotal moment, with the Yorkshireman going on to make a vital century in England's win. 

			 
Haddin sat out the second Test at Lord's to be with his ill daughter but was omitted from the XI, with Peter Nevill preferred, for the final three matches, which Lehmann later said was ""the hardest decision I've had to make as a coach, or even as a player"". 

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland was also effusive in his praise of Haddin. 

""Brad was a vital player during an important period in Australian cricket,"" he said. 

""His tenacity with bat and gloves was matched with an unflinching will to win which made him the foundation of a changing team. 

""Brad's strong performances and positive influence on the team were all the more remarkable given he was dealing with the serious illness suffered by his daughter Mia. 

			 
""He showed true leadership at the most difficult of times and proved a loyal deputy to Michael Clarke when appointed vice-captain from the 2013 Ashes series. 

""Brad can be enormously proud of his contribution to Australian cricket on and off the field."" 

Haddin  has also opted to retire from first-class cricket but will be available to play in the Big Bash League for the Sydney Sixers.

Rajai Davis hit his second home run of the day with one out in the seventh inning to break a 4-4 tie as the Detroit Tigers went on to beat the Rays, 5-4, this afternoon at Comerica Park. 

It was the second time career multi-home run game for Davis and his first since May 18, 2012. 

Rays lefty Drew Smyly, an ex-Tiger, allowed four runs on seven hits and one walk over five innings. He struck out three. 

Smyly lasted a little longer than Tigers starter Randy Wolf, who gave up four runs over 4 1/3 innings for the Tigers. 

Wolf gave up four consecutive hits with one out in the fifth as the Rays came back to tie the game, 4-4. 

J.P. Arencibia hit a solo home run, his third of the season. Brandon Guyer hit a double to right and scored to tie the game on Mikie Mahtook's line drive single to center. 

Evan Longoria, who had a single in the first and a two-run home run in the fourth, singled in the fifth to end Wolf's day. 

Wolf gave up eight hits and no walks with three strikeouts. He was replaced by Drew VerHagen, who allowed two hits over 1 2/3 scoreless innings. 

Al Alburquerque pitched one inning of relief and didn't allow a baserunner for the Tigers. 

Alex Wilson gave up one hit and had one strikeout in 2/3 of an inning. Lefty Blaine Hardy replaced Wilson and struck out pinch-hitter Tim Beckham in the eighth. Hardy returned in the ninth to get left-handed hitter Kevin Kiermaier to ground out to second. 

Bruce Rondon took over and loaded the bases before Logan Forsythe hit into a fielder's choice to end the game. 

Rondon gave up a walk to pinch hitter John Jaso, before pinch hitter Daniel Nava flied out to left. Grady Sizemore singled to center and Rondon gave up a walk to Longoria to load the bases. 

The Tigers and Rays traded two-run home runs in the third and fourth innings. 

The Tigers opened the scoring in the third on Davis' fifth home run of the season. Davis had a stomach issue in the first inning, which led to a visit from athletic trainer Kevin Rand. 

Davis remained in the game and followed a bloop double to left by Anthony Gose with his first home run of the day, a two-run shot to left off Smyly. 

The Rays came back to tie the game on a two-run home run by Longoria in the top of the fourth. Wolf gave up a double to Mahtook, then Longoria's 19th home run of the season. 

The Tigers responded with a two-run home run by James McCann in the bottom of the inning to regain their two-run lead. Nick Castellanos led off with a double and McCann followed with a home run to left. It was McCann's seventh home run of the season. 

Ian Kinsler had a single and double and and is two hits shy of 1,500 career hits. Kinsler has 54 multi-hit games for the Tigers this season, which leads the majors.

769301,727961b0-0a71-43e5-951b-a8fbfda8beb6,EPA Launching Changes to Diesel Emissions Testing,WCAV - HomePage - Headlines,"More StoriesLocal Reaction to Volkswagen RecallTests Find VW Thwarted Pollution Standards for YearsVirginia Joins Multi-State Investigation into VW EmissionsWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that it will launch sweeping changes to the way it tests for diesel emissions after getting duped by clandestine software in Volkswagen cars for seven years.In a letter to car manufacturers, the EPA said it will add on-road testing to its regimen, ""using driving cycles and conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device"" similar to the one used by Volkswagen.The testing would be in addition to the standard emissions test cycles already in place, the EPA said.VW's sophisticated software allowed its cars to pass tests in the lab and then spew pollution into the atmosphere while on the highway. The changes announced Friday are designed to detect software and other methods automakers might use to rig a test.""We're actually making sure that this is a one-off,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Friday.The agency is going to ""look at all of the other models aggressively and do the testing we need to make sure there aren't any hidden software devices or other ways they could defeat the emission system,"" McCarthy said.The revelations about VW led to unwanted scrutiny for the EPA. Its testing procedures have been criticized for being predictable and outdated, making it relatively easy for VW to cheat.EPA did not initially uncover the problem; researchers at West Virginia University did, using on-road testing that EPA did not.Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said he was frustrated that regulatory agencies such as the EPA are failing to protect the public. ""Seven years is way too long a time that the EPA has been asleep at the switch,"" he said.The VW case has similarities to those involving General Motors ' defective ignition switches and Takata Corp.'s exploding air bag inflators, where it also took years before those problems were disclosed to consumers, Nelson said.""When there is this kind of deception, we've got to get these agencies to be able to cut through it and catch it,"" he said.Chris Grundler, head of the EPA's office of transportation and air quality, defended the agency's testing procedures, noting that passenger vehicles with diesel engines account for far less than 1 percent of overall vehicle emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants.""It's not a question of equipment or technology or capability. It's a question of where we deploy those resources,"" Grundler told reporters Friday.The EPA has conducted on-road testing on heavy duty trucks, rather than passenger cars, ""because that's where the emissions are,"" he said. The additional testing announced Friday is part of a ""continuous evolution of our oversight"" of new and used cars and trucks, Grundler said.VW has admitted to installing so-called defeat devices on Volkswagen and Audi cars with four-cylinder diesel engines. The devices switch on pollution controls when the cars are being tested, but turn off the controls when the software determines that the cars are back on real roads. The EPA says about 500,000 U.S. cars including the Jetta, Golf, Beetle, Passat and Audi A3 have the cheating software, and VW says a total of 11 million cars have it worldwide.VW was able to fool the EPA because the agency only tested the cars on treadmill-like devices called dynamometers and didn't use portable test equipment on real roads. The software in the cars' engine-control computers checked the speed, steering wheel position, air pressure and other factors to determine when dynamometer tests were under way. It then turned on pollution controls that reduced the output of nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog and other pollution, the EPA has said.VW started the scheme with the 2009 model year, and may not have been caught without testing performed at West Virginia University on behalf of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit group that advises governments on regulations. EPA and California regulators confronted VW with those findings to VW in May 2014. The automaker eventually did a recall late last year, without much improvement, the EPA says.Only when the EPA and the California Air Resources Board refused to approve VW's 2016 diesel models for sale did the company admit earlier this month what it had done.The EPA said the cars are safe to drive but VW will have to pay to recall and fix them. VW also faces billions in fines.The European Union became aware in 2010 that lab testing was not as accurate as on-road tests might be. In the case of carbon dioxide emissions tests - not nitrogen oxide - the discrepancy was as much as 20 percent.The EU will introduce new tests from next year, with on-road testing complementing the laboratory work that is currently being done.

The testing would be in addition to the standard emissions test cycles already in place, the EPA said. VW's sophisticated software allowed its cars to pass tests in the lab and then spew pollution into the atmosphere while on the highway. The changes announced Friday are designed to detect software and other methods automakers might use to rig a test. ""We're actually making sure that this is a one-off,"" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Friday. The agency is going to ""look at all of the other models aggressively and do the testing we need to make sure there aren't any hidden software devices or other ways they could defeat the emission system,"" McCarthy said. The revelations about VW led to unwanted scrutiny for the EPA. Its testing procedures have been criticized for being predictable and outdated, making it relatively easy for VW to cheat. EPA did not initially uncover the problem; researchers at West Virginia University did, using on-road testing that EPA did not. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said he was frustrated that regulatory agencies such as the EPA are failing to protect the public. ""Seven years is way too long a time that the EPA has been asleep at the switch,"" he said. The VW case has similarities to those involving General Motors ' defective ignition switches and Takata Corp.'s exploding air bag inflators, where it also took years before those problems were disclosed to consumers, Nelson said. ""When there is this kind of deception, we've got to get these agencies to be able to cut through it and catch it,"" he said. Chris Grundler, head of the EPA's office of transportation and air quality, defended the agency's testing procedures, noting that passenger vehicles with diesel engines account for far less than 1 percent of overall vehicle emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. ""It's not a question of equipment or technology or capability. It's a question of where we deploy those resources,"" Grundler told reporters Friday. The EPA has conducted on-road testing on heavy duty trucks, rather than passenger cars, ""because that's where the emissions are,"" he said. The additional testing announced Friday is part of a ""continuous evolution of our oversight"" of new and used cars and trucks, Grundler said. VW has admitted to installing so-called defeat devices on Volkswagen and Audi cars with four-cylinder diesel engines. The devices switch on pollution controls when the cars are being tested, but turn off the controls when the software determines that the cars are back on real roads. The EPA says about 500,000 U.S. cars including the Jetta, Golf, Beetle, Passat and Audi A3 have the cheating software, and VW says a total of 11 million cars have it worldwide. VW was able to fool the EPA because the agency only tested the cars on treadmill-like devices called dynamometers and didn't use portable test equipment on real roads. The software in the cars' engine-control computers checked the speed, steering wheel position, air pressure and other factors to determine when dynamometer tests were under way. It then turned on pollution controls that reduced the output of nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog and other pollution, the EPA has said. VW started the scheme with the 2009 model year, and may not have been caught without testing performed at West Virginia University on behalf of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a nonprofit group that advises governments on regulations. EPA and California regulators confronted VW with those findings to VW in May 2014. The automaker eventually did a recall late last year, without much improvement, the EPA says. Only when the EPA and the California Air Resources Board refused to approve VW's 2016 diesel models for sale did the company admit earlier this month what it had done. The EPA said the cars are safe to drive but VW will have to pay to recall and fix them. VW also faces billions in fines. The European Union became aware in 2010 that lab testing was not as accurate as on-road tests might be. In the case of carbon dioxide emissions tests - not nitrogen oxide - the discrepancy was as much as 20 percent. The EU will introduce new tests from next year, with on-road testing complementing the laboratory work that is currently being done. Lab tests will also be refined to try to reduce the margin of error. It's not the first time the EPA has had to change testing to make sure automakers are playing by the rules. Earlier this year the agency updated gas mileage tests after some automakers were caught with inflated window sticker estimates.

About ITCA 650

ITCA 650 (a once or twice-yearly continuous subcutaneous delivery of exenatide) is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The investigational therapy employs Intarcia's proprietary technology platform involving a matchstick-size, miniature osmotic pump that is placed sub-dermally to provide continuous and consistent drug therapy, and the company's proprietary formulation technology, which maintains stability of therapeutic proteins and peptides at human body temperatures for extended periods of time. Exenatide, the active agent in ITCA 650, is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist currently marketed globally as twice-daily and once-weekly self-injection therapies for type 2 diabetes. Upon approval, ITCA 650 would represent the first injection-free GLP-1 therapy that can deliver up to a full year of treatment from a single placement. ITCA 650 is currently in a global Phase 3 clinical trial program called FREEDOM.

By enabling collaboration across audio, video and web conferencing, BT's solution speeds up decision making and will increase the productivity of Nutreco employees. The global scale of the solution will help the company achieve its growth ambitions in markets like Latin America 

The new solution, based on BT One Cloud Microsoft, is also expected to deliver significant cost savings by routing international calls over BT's global network and reducing the volume of email and voicemail as employees collaborate in real time.

The new infrastructure will be underpinned by BT's One Voice SIP trunking service. The SIP protocol enables cost-effective call-routing, helps reduce costs by simplifying the core infrastructure and eliminates the need for investment into hardware.

""BT is one of the very few providers capable of delivering global collaboration solutions based on Microsoft's Skype for Business, a well-known solution, appreciated by our users,"" said Henry van de Ven BT's technology vision: the Cloud of Clouds

The cloud is creating choices that never existed before. Through understanding those choices comes the confidence and the ability to harness change and do things that matter: get to market and innovate faster, keep costs down, and keep customers happy. 

BT's Cloud of Clouds vision is about allowing customers to connect easily and securely to the applications and data they need, regardless of where they're hosted and where they are based. 

As a cloud service integrator, we help customers move confidently and successfully along their cloud journey whilst minimizing the complexity, risk and cost; to give them a choice of roadmaps that work for their organization, in a way that will deliver the results they need.

We manage the whole process from network to cloud, we deal with third parties, deliver performance and security and simplify pricing, all under a single Service Level Agreement.
