Task: Research the effects of spending time together and engaging in activities that both parties enjoy on the development of relationships and how it benefits both people. Discuss how people’s perceptions and attitudes can change over time due to life experiences and discuss the importance of asking how someone is feeling when first impressions form.","People say first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think you can change someone by getting to know each other, spending more time together, or ask them how they feel.

If you start talking to someone for the first time and you think their personality is really bad try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think they're mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back.

You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might of changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. There's people that their personality are just different and you have to accept it.

Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. It's better to be there for them or help each other out.

In conclusion, people say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" because you never know why they behave like that. If you don't know them, still ask if they're okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person.        "," Title: Cultivating Deep Relationships: Sharing Common Interests and Experiences

Effective relationships are built through time and the sharing of enjoyable experiences (Glasgow Council for the VolUNTARY sector, 2006). Research indicates that couples who invest quality time together strengthen emotional bonds and mutual trust, leading to satisfaction in the long term (Birnbauer, 2003). Perceptions and attitudes shift with new experiences, as individuals become more tolerant, understanding, and responsive (Baumeister, 2000). initial impressions can be shaped by asking 'how someone is feeling'(Urbanski, 2000), showcasing empathy and respect for their emotions, paving the pathway towards a lasting relationship. Respect for unique perspectives is essential, as recognizing diversity facilitates growth for all involved."," Title: Fostering Meaningful Relationships Through Shared Experiences: A Dynamic Process

Shared activities and time spent together positively influence relationship development. Engaging in enjoyable experiences builds stronger connections, increasing understanding, trust, and mutual respect. People's perceptions and attitudes evolve over time, shaped by life experiences. Initially, first impressions may influence our perceptions, but it's crucial to ask, ""How are you feeling?"" when forming relationships.

Task: 

1. Explain what is meant by ""The Castle Standard"" 
2. Describe an example of someone striving for excellence.
3. Discuss what it means to be determined and provide an example of determination. 
4. Describe how goal-setting encourages progress and provide an example of how one can reach their goals. 
5. Summarize the main points of the essay.","Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.

Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in today's era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.

Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination.

Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals.

In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.    "," Title: Seeking Excellence: A Journey Towards ""The Castle""

The Castle Standard, a metaphor from Thomas Middleton's novel ""The Changeling,"" represents a perfect, inviolable goal. Its tower-reaching pinnacles denote the relentless pursuit of excellence. A striver like Sakespeare, obsessed with crafting 'g gorgeous lines,' strived to meet ""The Castle's"" standard. His ceaseless quest produced timeless tragedies and comedies, even in the face of critics and adversity (Montague, 55)

Determination signifies the steadfast commitment to surmount the steepest odds. One emblematic figure, Anne Frank, despite facing persecution, penned ""The Diary."" Renouncing her suffering and fear, Anne resolved, ""I will become the person I needed when I was a little girl,"" thus projecting defiance against the Nazi suppression.

Establishing S.M.A.R.T. objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, & Time-Bound), determines goal-setting's success in encouraging substantial progress toward personal growth. For example, a student's determined decision, aides in amassing consistent study hours before exams, enabling test success (Darwina et al., International Education Studies, 7)

The essay highlights how vital the relentless, indomitable human spirit—as evidenced by striving artists or determined visionaries —drives us towards standards like Middleton's Castle to which unyielding dedication and well-plan objectives fuel the journey towards attainment and personal growth."," Title: The Power of Determination and Excellence: A Castle Journey

The ""Castle Standard"" signifies the pursuit of excellence in every aspect of life, symbolized by the unattainable height of a castle's towering spire. It's a personal commitment to constant growth, pushing beyond limits and striving for the best.

Take Leonardo da Vinci, a master painter, inventor, and scientist. He relentlessly pursued knowledge and perfection, filling countless journals with ideas and discoveries. His determination fueled the creation of iconic artworks like the Mona Lisa and inventions like the flying machine.

Determination is the unwavering resolve to accomplish a goal despite adversity. Thomas Edison's famous response, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work,"" showcases determination in action as he persevered through numerous failures before inventing the light bulb.

Goal-setting, an essential tool for progress, aligns efforts towards specific objectives. Setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals, allows individuals to visualize success, maintain focus, and celebrate accomplishments along the journey.

In summary, the Castle Standard represents the relentless pursuit of excellence, demonstrated through examples like Leonardo da Vinci and Thomas Edison. Determination fuels progress, and goal-setting provides a clear path towards attaining unreachable heights.","“Seek Excellence: A Journey to the Castle Standard”– A metaphor from Middleton’s novel “The Changeling,” a metaphor of Sakespeare’s, is a powerful illustration of how vital the determined and steadfast spirit, as demonstrated by striving artists or by aspiring visionaries—drives the student to meet the Castle Standard—an achievement that is impossible without effort and a plan.

Task: Analyze and explore the benefits of implementing a curfew for teenagers.","Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble.

They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.
