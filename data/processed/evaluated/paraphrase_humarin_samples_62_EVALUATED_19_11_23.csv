Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III was inactive, just like last week, but the difference is that he was coming off a concussion for the opener, while he's healthy enough to play against the Rams. 

He lost his starting job to Kirk Cousins during the preseason; now he is down to No. 3 on the depth chart, behind backup Colt McCoy. 

Rams rookie running back Todd Gurley, coming off left knee surgery, practiced this week and was thought to have a chance to make his NFL debut on Sunday, but he was inactive.

11:55 a.m 

Wide receiver Dwayne Bowe will make his Cleveland Browns debut against the Titans. 

Bowe, who missed last week's game with a hamstring injury, should be one of the top targets for Johnny Manziel. 

Cleveland signed Bowe, formerly in Kansas City, to a 2-year, $12.5 million contract — $9 million guaranteed — in the offseason. 

—Tom Withers reporting from Cleveland 

11:50 a.m. 

Bills running back LeSean McCoy will play against the New England Patriots despite aggravating an injury to left hamstring in practice this week. 

McCoy had been listed as questionable. He's been bothered by the injury and missed the Bills final three preseason games after being hurt during a joint practice with the Cleveland Browns on Aug. 18. McCoy complained of being rusty after managing just 41 yards on 17 carries in Buffalo's 27-14 season-opening win over Indianapolis last week. He also had three catches for 46 yards. 

The Bills still managed a combined 147 yards rushing against Indianapolis — Buffalo's best total since gaining 193 at Chicago in last year's season opener.

That all changed on May 11 when Kapinus and his father, who owns K.A.P. Excavating in Eynon, were working in a Luzerne County cemetery. They were having trouble with the transmission on a small dump truck. Mike Kapinus was under the truck when it started to move. His son grabbed onto the passenger-side mirror and slowed it enough so, his father said, ""I was able to get out of harm's way. He saved my life."" Mike Kapinus suffered head injuries and a broken arm. His son was not as fortunate. When the truck hit a tree and spun around, a front wheel pinned him against the tree. His right leg was so badly injured it had to be amputated. While that ended his playing career, it has not stopped Kapinus from being part of the Lycoming football team. He received a prosthetic leg Aug. 10, and within days was out on the practice field with the aid of a cane as a student assistant coach. ""He loves Lycoming,"" his father said. ""This program means a lot me,"" Kapinus said in explaining why he came back. With friends on the team and the coaches, ""I couldn't imagine not being here."" The 21-year-old business management major with a minor in corporate communications works mainly with fullbacks, especially the younger kids, by giving them pointers. ""They've learned a lot,"" he said. ""He's a great resource for the fullbacks,"" Clark said. He helps with drills and ""more importantly sees the fullbacks while I'm watching the tailbacks. It is another set of eyes."" He uses his knowledge of the Warriors offense to correct the fullbacks or reinforce what they are doing is right, the coach said. Kapinus is on sidelines during games, working with Clark to make running back adjustments between offensive series. ""He made up his mind he was coming back,"" Clark said. ""I just marvel at his attitude every day. ""A lot of people in situations not nearly as challenging as this don't handle it anywhere close as he is handling it. It's amazing."" It was his goal was to get back to school and back to the football team, his father said. ""He's a hard worker,"" he said. ""He is just a good kid. He's always polite. He was a good team player."" Although he saw action in 15 games for Lycoming the past two years, Kapinus never carried the ball. The Warriors use fullbacks primarily as blocking backs.       Bouncing back from the devastating injury does not surprise his father. ""He's never been negative,"" he said. Kapinus was a member of the 2011 District 2 championship Valley View football team, where he played fullback and linebacker. He averaged about 7 yards a carry. He was first team all-Lackawanna League fullback and a second-team linebacker. Despite weighing 200 pounds, he also ran track. His father said he used to tell him when comparing him with runners 40 pounds lighter ""you're the fastest truck."" Kapinus also won awards for weightlifting in high school and said he continues to lift.

Cheerios is one of the many popular breakfast cereals regularly consumed by many Americans, including diabetics. These breakfast cereals are low in fat, low in sugar and contain a type of fiber called soluble fiber, which has been shown to help lower LDL cholesterol levels. However, like all breakfast cereals, Cheerios contain carbohydrates, a nutrient that needs to be controlled in order to keep your blood sugar levels within the recommended target of 70 to 130 mg/dL before your meals and no more than 180 mg/dL two hours after the start of your meals. 

Carbohydrates and Diabetes 

Carbohydrates are found in sugar, starchy vegetables, fruits, milk, yogurt as well as in grains such as breakfast cereals. Whenever you consume carbohydrates at a meal or at a snack, these carbohydrates are converted to small molecule of sugar, or glucose, during the digestion process. The glucose resulting from the digestion of the carbohydrates then enters your bloodstream to rise your blood sugar levels. Usually, people without diabetes are able to control the rise in their blood sugar levels by producing the right amount of insulin to counteract the glucose in the blood. In diabetics, however, eating too many carbohydrates at once can result in high blood sugar levels, either because of a lack of insulin, as in Type 1 diabetes, or because of a resistance of the body cells to adequately respond to insulin, as in Type 2 diabetes.

Cheerios Nutrition Facts 

Although 1 cup of Cheerios only contains 1 gram of sugar per serving, it also contains 20 grams of total carbohydrates, including 3 grams of fiber. Because fiber does not rise your blood sugar levels, you can subtract them from the total carbohydrates, which already include the amount of sugar. In this case, 1 cup of Cheerios therefore contains 17 grams of available carbohydrates. The apple and cinnamon Cheerios contains 24 grams of carbohydrates and 2 grams of fiber per three-fourth cup, which corresponds to 22 grams of available carbs for a smaller portion, as do the banana nut Cheerios. 

Eating Too Much Cheerios 

For most diabetics, a meal should not contain more than 60 grams of carbohydrates, according to the American Diabetes Association. Some diabetics also need to further restrict their carbohydrate intake lower than these general recommendations to have good control of their blood sugar levels. If your morning bowl of cereals include 2 cups of regular Cheerios, a cup of milk and a whole sliced banana, your available carbohydrate content would reach 76 grams of carbohydrates, which could result in high blood sugar levels. This could make your blood sugar levels climb above the recommended range. 

Cheerios at Your Breakfast 

If you enjoy eating Cheerios for breakfast, you can include them in your diabetes diet in a controlled amount. For example, you could have a cup of regular Cheerios with milk and half of a banana for 41 grams of available carbohydrates. If you choose the flavored varieties of Cheerios, that same breakfast would contain 53 grams of available carbohydrates. You could also have a cup of regular Cheerios mixed with cup of plain yogurt and half a cup blueberries or a cup of strawberries for 40 grams of available carbohydrates. If you need to keep your carbohydrates lower to control your blood sugar levels, cut your serving of Cheerios in half and complete your meal with more protein from eggs, almonds or peanut butter.

Portcullis provides cybersecurity services to enterprise and the government sector clients, mostly in Europe. Cisco said the acquisition will help accelerate its own security services business and expand its security consulting services outside of North America. 

Cisco said it will also complement last year’s acquisition of Neohapsis , a security consulting firm that evaluates corporate security, risk and compliance, including payment card industry, HIPAA and HITECH compliance, security assessment, penetration testing, incident response and risk management. 

Portcullis’ security consulting services include assessments to identify vulnerabilities, forensic testing, first responder training to prepare for attacks, policy review and creation, security awareness training, and overall security posture audits. Cisco says this portfolio will help it offer a range of security, risk and compliance services to help clients overcome operational and technical security challenges, and anticipate and respond to new threats.

Small wonder, he asked his fellow travellers in one of his to walk at a more brisk pace as the revolution lay just ahead (Ektu Pa Chaliye Bhai, Biplab Asche). It was a clear departure from the earlier Kallolgeneration of poets; and Mukhopadhya’s distinctive, direct voice, allied with his technical skill and radical world-view, gained him great popularity. In his poetry, he delved deep into the massive upheavals of that era which ruptured Bengali society. 
 
The 1940s were marked by world war, famine, Partition, communal riots and mass emigration in Bengal. His writings broke away from the traditional moorings of the establishment poets. His works addressed the despair and disillusion felt by the common people. 
 
A lifelong advocate of the indivisibility of the Bengali people and Bengali culture, his radical activism continued unabated. Later in the 1970s, his poetry took a turn toward the narrative and the allegorical. But he never lost his technical facility nor his unique voice. Besides verse, Subhash also wrote works of prose including novels, essays and travelogues. He was active in journalism too, having served on the editorial staff of daily and weekly newspapers. 
 
He was an editor of the leading Bengali literary journal Parichay. He was also an accomplished and popular writer for children. He edited the Bengali children’s periodical Sandesh jointly with Satyajit Ray for a few years in the early sixties.

The Liberal Party's star candidate in the Canning byelection, Andrew Hastie, has ruled out a discussion of his religious beliefs while campaigning with former prime minister John Howard. In a forthright statement at the start of a campaign appearance, the former SAS captain hinted that questions of his theology were being pushed by his political opponents.

Mr Hastie's father is a Presbyterian minister who it is understood believes in creationism.

Asked about his own beliefs and the possibility he shared his father's creationist views Mr Hastie declared it was off limits.

""I won't go into what people have asked me about him because frankly it's not relevant,"" Mr Hastie said.

""His views are his views and as an Australian in this democracy he is entitled to those views.

""I'm proud to have served alongside Australians who have been atheist, Christian, Catholic, Anglican, Buddhist, Hindu, Mormon, whatever, it doesn't matter.""

The remarks were made at a sometimes bizarre campaign appearance beside a shopping centre car park, which included a heckler calling out during the press conference to challenge Mr Howard about the Abbott government's asylum seeker policies.

The 32-year-old Mr Hastie also declared he was opposed to same-sex marriage.

""On the question of gay marriage that's been put to me, I am personally opposed to same-sex marriage but I am very much in favour of the Australian people having a popular vote to decide this crucial issue,"" he said.

""It is a foundational issue to Australian society and therefore it should be decided by Australian people and not the political elite.""

That response was given as part of an answer to a question about a blog post his wife Ruth had uploaded while she was working as a receptionist at a church in Perth.

""Her responsibilities were that of an office receptionist and in those duties she uploaded blogs as published by the pastoral staff,"" Mr Hastie said.

""A blog was published in relation to the issue of homosexuality and Ruth was responsible for posting that.

""She was not the author of it. Questions have been raised about that.""

Mr Hastie said it was ""totally unacceptable"" for questions to be asked about his wife and father and said he was not interested in ""question of theology or anything else because it doesn't relate to this campaign"".

""I have no problem with people coming after me, but just make sure you come after me and not my family,"" he said.

Tensions flared between contestants as The X Factor's super-sized boot camp got under way at a country house location in Hertfordshire. For the last three years, this stage of the ITV singing competition has put auditionees through the dreaded Six Chair Challenge held at Wembley in order to cut down the numbers.

However, boot camp has previously been notorious for hopefuls getting up to all kinds of antics in the country, including partying and fighting.

The move back to a more rural setting is seen as a ploy to increase ratings, and it has apparently paid off as the stress of impressing judges Simon Cowell, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Nick Grimshaw and Rita Ora sparked tears, arguments and drinking.

In tonight's episode, viewers will see 25-year-old Monica Michael clash with fellow hopeful Princess Diamond.

The contestants had to split into groups comprised of the four categories: Groups, Overs, Boys and Girls before choosing a song to perform to the panel.

""You all got together, any arguments?"" Cowell asked the ladies before him.

Princess Diamond surprised everyone when she immediately complained about the youth worker. ""Monica came to me all up in my face for no reason,"" she said.

Michael hit back: ""We're rehearsing and there's gaps because we're waiting for her. Obviously, it's a team effort right now so we're running around trying to babysit her and it's just frustrating.""

The row between the two women is then detailed in a flashback sequence which ends with Princess Diamond walking off on her own after accusing Michael of having ""too much attitude"".

The girls try to put their differences aside when they perform Blank Space by Taylor Swift for the judging panel.

Elsewhere, Blackpool's Ryan Ruckledge, who had previously auditioned for The X Factor in 2013, threw a hissy fit over the song choice of Anything Can Happen by Ellie Goulding.

He annoyed the other people in his group with his prima donna behaviour.

""I don't hate the competition. I just hate the song,"" the 22-year-old said before heading to the free bar and asking for the strongest vodka and orange. 

""I am feeling double-stressed. I'm having to have a bottle of wine and a beer and some doubles,"" he said. Later on, he jumped into a pool to sober up. 

Boot camp is taking place over five Sundays to avoid the Rugby World Cup and this first instalment will also focus on church singer Jennifer Phillips and Tina Tuner sound-alike Bupsi from the Overs; London Community Choir members Bekln and Silver Tone from the Groups; Stephanie Beeby and dentist receptionist Lauren Murray from the Girls and charismatic Australian Sean Miley Moore and 21-year-old Mason Noise from the Boys.

But even after this country house stage, boot camp is not over as the acts will then face the emotionally-gruelling Six Chair Challenge to win a place at Judges' Houses.

                            ""It's shocking they passed us over,"" said Ken Stone, chair of the Community Coalition against Racism. ""In our city, three to four times more black people are stopped than white people and 1.5 times as many aboriginals as white people."" 
 

                            A street check, or ""carding,"" is a general term for a type of questioning the police use to engage and record interactions with citizens whose location, time or behaviour seem out of the ordinary.  
 

                            According to police records, Hamilton officers have conducted more than 9,000 street checks since 2010. The information requested from citizens is written into a detailed two-page form kept indefinitely by the police. 
 

                            Despite evidence showing that carding has impacted minorities the most, police Chief Glenn De Caire, said his officers ""do not activate any of their policing authorities based on race."" 
 

                            Opponents of street checks say abolishment is the only option, because carding is unconstitutional and has never been proven to work. 
 

                            ""It hasn't been proven to be evidence-based policing,"" said Green, adding that when police presented their data in July, they struggled to show it had produced results. 
 

                            Although Green supports abolishment, if regulation of carding were the only option, he said there should be a few important requirements, such as informing citizens that they do not have to answer questions, and providing citizens with carbon copy receipts. 
 

                            Brent Ross, a spokesperson for the province, said although Hamilton wasn't chosen as a venue, the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services encourages ""community groups and other organizations to hold their own meetings throughout the province and to present the ministry with their feedback."" 
 

                            Ismael Traore, co-founder of Black, Brown, Red Lives Matter, said it might be beneficial that Hamilton was holding its own meeting since the province was confining the conversation to regulation. 
 

                            ""We can do this at a municipal level, and show all the other communities in Ontario that Hamilton is for total abolition of carding,"" he said.

Faculties will be selected on all India level selection system which means that the proposed hospital will have the best services available. Actually, in the beginning, the proposal was of opening a cancer hospital but later on it was changed and s super specialist hospital was contemplated. The Board does not stop there but plans to incept a Medical College and also a College for Nursing once the contemplated hospital is established and begins to function normally. Permission for establishing these colleges will be sought  from proper authorities in due course of time and it is hoped that there will be no hitch to obtaining permission because the Board intends to complete all requisite formalities in this connection. 
This is a very laudable mission undertaken by the Shrine Board. For quite some time, the Board has been holding consultations with Narayana Hrudayalaya, Bangalore, which would run the hospital in joint venture with the Shrine Board. They will have management control and bear the running expenditure. Hopefully the hospital will provide high quality treat 
Jammu civil society has been noting with great satisfaction that Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board has immensely contributed to social development in almost all spheres and has become a model institute for the rest of the country. In the first place is the development of infrastructure of the Shrine to which lakhs of people come for pilgrimage. Maximum facilities of travel, stay, uphill hike, transport and board and lodging have been provided. Now under contemplation is the project of ropeway between Bhawan and Bhairon Ghati, and in all probability, a Swiss company will cooperate with a local firm in the construction of the ropeway? Additionally, the Shrine Board is likely to commission alternate track from Katra to Adh Kunwari by the end of this year. All these developmental works are making pilgrimage to the holy shrine more attractive for the people in the country. Incidentally, the Railway Minister has announced that at least 12 more trains will be extended from Jammu to Katra enabling pilgrims from all parts of the country an easy access to the last railway station to the Shrine. Thus the once obscure and nondescript hamlet of Katra has emerged as one of the country’s most visited town as the starting point for hike to the holy shrine.

( NYSE: CLR ) (Continental or the Company) today announced plans to spend approximately $300 to $350 million less than its previously approved capital budget for 2015 to better align spending with cash flow at current commodity prices. The Company plans to defer well completion activity, except for where it has contractual considerations or it accomplishes specific strategic objectives. Continental is also reducing its operated rig count in the Bakken from 10 to eight rigs by the end of the month. 

Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120327/DA76602LOGO  
   
""While we do not believe today's low commodity prices are sustainable long term, we are committed to living within cash flow until they recover,"" said Harold Hamm , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We are reducing capital expenditures to protect our balance sheet and to preserve the value of our world-class assets until commodity prices improve."" 

The Company's 2015 guidance remains unchanged.  Continental continues to expect production growth of 19% to 23% for the year, compared with 2014, but now expects to exit the year with production in a range of approximately 200,000 to 215,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) per day. The bottom end of the range is 10,000 Boe per day below its previously stated outlook, reflecting an increase of inventory from the previously expected 100 gross operated wells that are drilled but not yet completed at year-end 2015 to the current estimate of 160 gross wells drilled but not yet completed at year-end 2015.  Maintenance capital to maintain 2016 production at the 2015 exit rate is now projected to be $1.6 to $2.0 billion . 

In its August 5, 2015 earnings press release and on its August 6 earnings conference call, the Company noted actual capital spending was trending below its $2.7 billion non-acquisition capital expenditures budget and further noted that, if weak oil prices persisted, the Company would take additional measures to balance capital expenditures with reduced cash flow. 

""We continue to focus on achieving cash flow neutrality in the current environment,"" said John Hart , Chief Financial Officer. ""We believe it is in the interest of shareholders to defer new production growth until we see stronger commodity prices. We can achieve this objective due to our focus on costs, operating efficiencies and having a large portion of our high-potential leasehold already held by production,"" he said. 

""We are pleased with our results year-to-date, and operating performance versus guidance remains strong, especially in terms of production growth and cost controls. Annual production growth is expected to be toward the top end of our guidance range, even with deferred completions,"" he said. ""Production expense per Boe and general and administrative expense per Boe are also trending positively toward the low end of guidance. Lower capex spending and excellent operating performance should position us to be cash flow neutral for the remainder of 2015 in an environment of approximately $50 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate. In a $40 per barrel WTI environment, our updated spending outlook would result in capital expenditures being approximately $150 million over cash flow.  We continue to have ample liquidity with approximately $1.3 billion available under our credit facility at August 31, 2015 , basically in line with our June 30, 2015 balance.""

Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions about future events and currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. Although the Company believes these assumptions and expectations are reasonable, they are inherently subject to numerous business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. No assurance can be given that such expectations will be correct or achieved or that the assumptions are accurate. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, commodity price volatility; the geographic concentration of our operations; financial market and economic volatility; the inability to access needed capital; the risks and potential liabilities inherent in crude oil and natural gas exploration, drilling and production and the availability of insurance to cover any losses resulting therefrom; difficulties in estimating proved reserves and other reserves-based measures; declines in the values of our crude oil and natural gas properties resulting in impairment charges; our ability to replace proved reserves and sustain production; the availability or cost of equipment and oilfield services; leasehold terms expiring on undeveloped acreage before production can be established; our ability to project future production, achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations and predict the amount and timing of development expenditures; the availability and cost of transportation, processing and refining facilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our business, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing; increased market and industry competition, including from alternative fuels and other energy sources; and the other risks described under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 , registration statements and other reports filed from time to time with the SEC, and other announcements the Company makes from time to time. 

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which such statement is made. Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this press release occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.

Except as expressly stated above or otherwise required by applicable law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or circumstances after the date of this report, or otherwise. 

Readers are cautioned that initial production rates are subject to decline over time and should not be regarded as reflective of sustained production levels.  In particular, production from horizontal drilling in shale oil and natural gas resource plays and tight natural gas plays that are stimulated with extensive pressure fracturing are typically characterized by significant early declines in production rates. 

We use the term ""EUR"" or ""estimated ultimate recovery"" to describe potentially recoverable oil and natural gas hydrocarbon quantities.  We include these estimates to demonstrate what we believe to be the potential for future drilling and production on our properties.  These estimates are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and require substantial capital spending to implement recovery.  Actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially.  EUR data included herein remain subject to change as more well data is analyzed.

1ac81e93-03a3-4ab5-8181-95732822cb4c,"Nebraska avoids another heartbreak, survives late scare against Southern Miss",News,ESPN.com,"Southern Miss nearly flipped the script on Nebraska. 

One week after storming back from 23 points down the fourth quarter to force overtime in a loss at Miami, the Huskers surrendered three late touchdowns in less than seven minutes, holding on for a 36-28 win Saturday over the Golden Eagles at Memorial Stadium. 

Nebraska (2-2) jumped to a 22-0 halftime lead on five field goals by Drew Brown and a defensive effort that held Southern Miss to minus-14 rushing yards in the opening two quarters. But Nick Mullens threw for for 331 yards in the second half, finishing with 447 against a maligned Nebraska secondary to keep the outcome in doubt until the final second. 

After Brown missed a 24-yard field goal with 29 seconds to play, Mullens hit Casey Martin for gains of 19 and 21 yards to reach the Nebraska 40-yard line. Defensive end Freedom Akinmoladun then sacked Mullens. The clock expired before Southern Miss could attempt a Hail Mary. 

What the win means for Nebraska: More stress. The Huskers escaped against an inferior opponent, getting 368 yards on 23-of-35 passing from Tommy Armstrong Jr. On one hand, the Huskers aren’t far from 4-0, losing on the final play against BYU and Miami. Conversely, Nebraska enters Big Ten play next week at Illinois with a secondary in something close to disarray, threatening to derail progress made in other areas under first-year coach Mike Riley. 

What the loss means for Southern Miss: The Golden Eagles failed to duplicate their 2004 victory in Lincoln, but the effort in coming back confirms the continued progress under third-year coach Todd Monken. Southern Miss enters play in Conference USA at 2-2 with competitive showings against Nebraska and Mississippi State to buoy confidence. 

Unsung hero: Nebraska fullback Andy Janovich rushed five times for 68 yards and caught one pass for 53. Prior to Saturday, the senior from Gretna, Nebraska, had rushed three times in his career for 6 yards. Janovich, a special teams star, did everything Saturday but score. Actually, he did reach the end zone on a 15-yard run in the fourth quarter, but it was called back for a holding penalty on receiver Alonzo Moore. The Huskers need a physical presence in their run game. And while Janovich likely won’t get as much work as Saturday on a regular basis, he adds an nice element to the offense. 

Uh, what? Nebraska cornerback Joshua Kalu was flagged for pass interference on fourth-and-13 throw by Mullens to Martin with seven minutes to play in the fourth quarter. The Golden Eagles got a nice acting performance from Martin, who flopped to the ground after minimal contact as Kalu intercepted the pass near the goal line. Kalu was also flagged for a personal foul after he spiked the football, giving Southern Miss a first down at the 1. It scored on the next play, cutting Nebraska’s lead to the final margin of eight points.",488,"Southern Miss nearly flipped the script on Nebraska.

By Ada Colau Ballano, mayor of Barcelona, Spain


The day before yesterday 50 people died by suffocation in the hold of a ship. Yesterday more than 70 people were found dead inside a lorry. Today we wake up with two shipwrecks: perhaps more than a hundred dead. We have a sea full of dead people. Borders full of wires, spikes, blades… and dead people.

Men, women, boys and girls, dead.

And a part of Europe weeps, cries out, a part wishes them to be saved, to not die but… but does not want them to come over. They should go away, they should disappear, they shouldn’t exist and we shouldn’t have to see them on TV, let alone on our streets, with their blankets, in the subway or on the steps of our homes.

Some irresponsibly promote fear of “the other”, “the illegal”, “those who come to sell without a permit”, “to use our healthcare”, “to take our school places”, “to scrounge”, “to beg”, “to commit crime”…

But fear is just that: fear. Our fear to live in a bit worse conditions against their fear to not be able to survive. Our fear of having to share a small part of our welfare against their fear of hunger and death, which is so acute that it gave them the strength to risk it all in order to come over without any baggage other than their own fear.

Fear against fear. And theirs is stronger. So, Europe, Europeans: open your eyes. There will not be enough walls and wires nor teargas nor rubber bullets to stop this. We either approach a human tragedy starting from our ability to love that makes us human or we are all going to end up dehumanized. And there will be more deaths, many more. This is not a struggle to protect us from “the others”. Right now it is a war against life.

Governments have to stop threatening with the “call effect”. What Europe urgently needs is an “affect call”, a call for empathy. They could be our children, our sisters or mothers. It could be us, just like many of our grandparents were forced into exile.

Even though it is a matter of State and European competence, from Barcelona we will do all we can to participate in a network of refugee-cities. We want cities that are committed to human rights and to life, cities of which we can be proud.

a14db9b7-bdbf-4eb9-a4ec-c45b4b61b654,'Vaccination Against Rabies Is Free' [interview],News,Individual.com,"Dr. Laura Besong, Sub-Director In charge of Food Safety and Veterinary Public Health, Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries. 

How should people take care of their pets daily? 

Having a pet is like someone having a baby. The animal needs to be fed, treated taken care of properly. It has to be washed regularly to prevent smells and infestation by worms and other parasites that can be detrimental to its health. I will like to call on pet owners to have a responsible behaviour towards their animals. The animals should not be left to go out and fend for themselves because many people have pets but these animals go to the dustbin and feed. It is very dangerous because when an animal gets infested outside, it comes back to the house and plays with children and with the owners. This is very dangerous because it can transmit rabies to the members of the family and even to the neighbours around. 

The animals have a right to treatment which includes vaccination. 

What should an individual do when bitten by a pet? 

When someone is bitten by a pet or scratched by a cat, this person should wash the wound with a lot of water and soap. That will reduce the viruses that were deposited on the wound and by so doing, reduce the risks of being contaminated and infected with rabies then he should go to a health centre to be administered an anti tetanus injection, as well as the human treatment for rabies which is usually called the post-treatment. 

What is the government doing to fight stray animals that are a danger to the population? 

Fighting against stray animals is the responsibility of the Council. The Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industry has given funds to some urban councils to tackle this public health issue. The Council, for example organises the killing or elimination of stray dogs on public roads. This is done in collaboration with the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation which issues an order instructing that this activity be carried out with MINEPIA staff. Conventions have been signed with laboratories like Centre Pasteur for diagnosis, surveillance and training of its personnel as well as vaccination of personnel who are exposed. The main way of preventing rabies is through the vaccination of dogs and eliminating it from the animal population. 

Can you tell us about this campaign that begins today and targets about 8000 pets? 

When we evaluate the annual vaccination campaign, we understand that most people cannot really afford to pay for this vaccine even though it is subsidised. So the Minister has decided to put in place 8,000 vaccines to fight rabies through this campaign.",451,"Dr. Laura Besong, Sub-Director In charge of Food Safety and Veterinary Public Health, Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries.

051252c0-a2e2-4a63-97af-5987dbedfb0d,When Cup fever runneth over,News,New Zealand Herald,"A hidden force is threatening to compromise the All Blacks at the World Cup and it's one they have little means of controlling. 

It's not public expectation that has the power to derail them - it's the sense of entitlement that is growing, with an ever-greater number of people feeling they have a valid ownership stake in the All Blacks. 

Success has fuelled public interest in the All Blacks - gained them popularity beyond the usual confines of the rugby-obsessed and in Richie McCaw they have a leader who unites the nation. They haven't gone out of their way to cultivate a higher profile, but they have consciously shaped their image and been careful to project themselves in a way that befits their values. 

This is an All Black side with an appreciation of their ability to influence the nation and they are selective and deliberate about what they endorse as a group; about the style and tone of their public events. 

Their perception of legacy extends beyond results - they want to be judged holistically; for their standing off the field to be as prevalent and recognisable as their achievements on it. How they behave, what they support and with whom they engage are all important factors in that. 

The difficulty they face around the World Cup is being able to be what they want to be: preserve their right to be masters of their own agenda. This is the thing about World Cups, suddenly everyone is interested in rugby and everyone wants a piece of the All Blacks. 

It becomes decidedly hard for them to be at ease with life - as was evidenced with the official squad announcement. If it had been up to the players to choose the venue, Parliament would have been nowhere near the shortlist. 

But it wasn't up to the players. New Zealand Rugby Union chief executive Steve Tew made the decision to announce the squad in Wellington. 

The fit was all wrong. Politics is a divisive subject - a source of tension and conflict in many communities. This idea - as pushed by the Minister for Sport and Recreation, Dr Jonathan Coleman - that the Beehive was the perfect venue given it is the place where all of New Zealand is represented, was flimsy, lazy spin that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

Without putting too fine a point on it, no one particularly likes politicians. Who doesn't troop to the voting booth with a heavy heart, trying to determine of all the options on the ballot paper, which can be ticked with the least damage to the soul? 

When the All Blacks connect with the people, they don't want politicians to be the conduit. Besides, if the point of the exercise last Sunday was to connect with the people, why hold the announcement in New Zealand's highest-security building, with a vetted and tightly controlled guest list? And why broadcast it exclusively on a pay-per-view channel - denying at least half of New Zealand the chance to consume the news live? 

Sunday night wasn't about the people. It was about the politicians who could see they were being thrown a no-risk, win-win scenario. What value to the National Party that picture of Dr Coleman and John Key, grinning inanely in the front row of the official team shot? 

They can ride the wave of public interest knowing that if the All Blacks win the World Cup, they have publicity gold. And if they don't, Key and Coleman can quietly distance themselves when the team returns. 

The indisputable proof the whole evening wasn't about the All Blacks came when leader of the Opposition, Andrew Little, could no longer contain himself. After the cameras snapped a handful of shots with Key and Coleman, he strode across the floor, shoulder slightly dipped, looking to force his way into the frame. 

He managed it but what he and his peers probably failed to notice was that when it was time to mix and mingle, the All Black players, almost to a man, headed straight for the pitiful number of schoolkids who had been invited. 

That was the moment that said it all: the All Blacks weren't there by choice but their professionalism enabled them to smile and small-talk their way through it without fuss. Left to their own devices, the players gravitated towards the respective captains of the various Wellington Schools First XVs who were there. They shook hands; offered advice and looked, for the only time in the whole evening, to be at ease. 

But of course the cameras weren't on for that bit. The archives will paint an altogether different picture of a glitzy do at the seat of power. 

History can be unforgiving and a squad announcement at Parliament will look awfully like hubris if the World Cup campaign doesn't go as planned. Which brings things back to the point at hand - if it had been up to the players, they wouldn't have been at Parliament.

The team of authors is composed of Hemispherx staff, consultants and leading independent clinical experts in CFS/ME in the United States. 

Data from a previous Phase III clinical trial of Ampligen in patients with CFS/ME were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether baseline exercise tolerance (ET) could be used to predict responses to Ampligen (rintatolimod) vs. placebo. A modified Bruce ET treadmill test was used because of the severe physical exercise intolerance of CFS patients. A continuous responder analysis provided further support for a significant clinical enhancement in the ET effect in the Ampligen(R) cohorts as compared to placebo. Taken in context with the recent peer reviewed publication pointing to reduced NK function in CFS/ME patients, (entitled ""Low NK Cell Activity in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Relationship to Symptom Severity"" in which 17 studies were reviewed that evaluated NK cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) data and the relationship to different CFS case definitions and CFS disease severity, Journal of Clinical and Cellular Immunology (Strayer D, et al, J Clin Cell Immunol 2015;6:4 http://doi.org/10.4172/2155-9899.1000348), a new set of evidence based criteria have now been identified which may assist in selection of CFS/ME patients who may derive significant benefit clinically from therapeutic intervention with selective TLR-3-dsRNA activators. ""In context, this clear statistical improvement corroborates our independent clinical experts, who indicate that they have also identified criteria predictive of responsiveness to our experimental drug Ampligen(R)"", states Tom Equels, President of Hemispherx. 

About Hemispherx Biopharma Hemispherx Biopharma, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and engaged in the clinical development of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based disorders. Hemispherx's flagship products include Alferon N Injection(R) and the experimental therapeutics Ampligen(R) and Alferon(R) LDO. Ampligen(R) is an experimental RNA nucleic acid being developed for globally important debilitating diseases and disorders of the immune system, including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Hemispherx's platform technology includes components for potential treatment of various severely debilitating and life threatening diseases including cancers. Because both Ampligen(R) and Alferon(R) LDO are experimental in nature, they are not designated safe and effective by a regulatory authority for general use and are legally available only through clinical trials. Hemispherx has patents comprising its core intellectual property estate and a fully commercialized product (Alferon N Injection(R)), approved for sale in the U.S. and Argentina. The FDA approval of Alferon N Injection(R) is limited to the treatment of refractory or recurrent external genital warts in patients 18 years of age or older. The Company's Alferon N Injection(R) approval in Argentina includes the use of Alferon N Injection(R) (under the brand name ""Naturaferon"") for use in any patients who fail, or become intolerant to recombinant interferon, including patients with chronic active hepatitis C infection. The Company wholly owns and exclusively operates a GMP certified manufacturing facility in the United States for commercial products. For more information please visit www.hemispherx.net. 

Disclosure Notice 

The information in this press release includes certain ""forward-looking"" statements including without limitation statements about additional steps which the FDA may require and Hemispherx may take in continuing to seek commercial approval of the Ampligen(R) NDA for the treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in the United States. The production of new Alferon(R) API inventory will not commence until the capital improvement and validation phases are complete. While the facility is approved by FDA under the Biological License Application (""BLA"") for Alferon(R), this status will need to be reaffirmed upon the completion of the facility's enhancements prior to commercial sale of newly produced inventory product. If and when we obtain a reaffirmation of FDA BLA status and have begun production of new Alferon(R) API, we will need FDA approval as to the quality and stability of the final product to allow commercial sales to resume. The final results of these and other ongoing activities could vary materially from Hemispherx's expectations and could adversely affect the chances for approval of the Ampligen(R) NDA in the United States and other countries. Any failure to satisfy the FDA regulatory requirements or the requirements of other countries could significantly delay, or preclude outright, approval of the Ampligen(R) NDA in the United States and other countries. The re-launch of Alferon(R) N as a commercial product cannot commence until all regulatory approvals have been obtained.

Labor Day 2015 is behind us, and the attention of the Philadelphia sports fan has now turned to the Eagles . A few years ago, though, this would also be the time to watch the Phillies make a run at the playoffs. From 2001 to 2006, the Phillies were generally pretty close. From 2007 to 2011, they made five consecutive trips to the postseason. 
 
In 2015, the Phillies are trying to avoid losses in the triple digits. And fans are clearly focused on other subjects: 15,125 attended last night’s 7-2 loss to the Braves, the smallest crowd in Citizens Bank Park history. 
 
The Phillies now have two dozen games left in the season. They are 53-85. They need to go 10-14 to avoid losing 100 games. That .417 winning percentage is better than the team’s current .384, so they need to actually pick things up a bit. 
 
There’s no extra penalty for losing more than 100 games, but the Phillies — who have a whopping 14 100-loss seasons in their history — haven’t had a triple-digit loss season since 1961! That’s a long stretch for a team so steeped in awful history. 
 
But don’t go rooting for them to win just yet. The Phillies are also in a race (“race”) for the first overall pick in next year’s MLB draft. This once seemed secure. Their hot stretch after the All-Star break , however, has complicated things. The Braves were once 42-42; they’ve gone 13-41 since. After last night’s win, the Braves are two games ahead of the Phils in the standings. 
 
As a fan, you’d like the Phillies to avoid losing 100 games — but don’t want them to lose the first overall pick in the draft. Being a Phillies fan right now is like rooting for the Sixers! 
 
You’ll have another chance to experience those complicated rooting feelings tonight when the Phillies host the Braves again at 7:05 p.m.

The papal seal will also be affixed to the side of the aircraft, the only major modification that's planned. However, the flight number will be blocked per a Secret Service request, so the public won't be able to track its progress.

Air traffic control officials will use the name ""Shepherd One"" when speaking to the American Airlines captain flying the plane. 

It's become customary for the Pope to fly on and return home from official visits on the flag carrier of the country he has toured. 

The Pope's aircraft, chartered by the U.S. Conference of Bishops, will fly Francis from Andrews to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and then to Philadelphia International Airport before carrying the pope back to Rome at the end of his first U.S. visit. 

American Airlines and TWA -- which have merged -- have a long history of carrying the Pope during visits to the United States. This trip will be the seventh time TWA and American Airlines have flown the Pope around the United States.

ea5e5e46-2329-4bf6-a792-5178a057610c,"High school girls volleyball: Woodland saves 4 match points, beats Inderkum, 3-2",News,Woodland Daily Democrat,"There were few if any illusions for the Woodland High School girls volleyball team as they headed to Inderkum Wednesday night. 

“(Wednesday) I know going to Sacramento would be a difficult task,” Wolves head coach Idelle Nicdao said. “I know their players are tall and very, very physical. Most of their front row players are about 6-feet tall and very, very physical and very athletic ladies.” 

So it was no surprise when the Wolves ended up playing their second-straight, five-set match. It was the way they outlasted the Tigers for the 25-19, 19-25, 23-25, 27-25, 15-9 Tri-County Conference victory that was special. 
  
Woodland (4-1, 2-0 TCC) trailed Inderkum two sets to one and 24-20 in the fourth set, but rallied behind two kills from outside hitter Jessica Baker and a key tip and block from middle blocker Liz Luchessi to win the set. 

Baker (26 kills, six digs) and Killion Newsom (14 kills) controlled the final set for the Wolves, who have taken the early TCC lead as the only school without a league loss. 

Inderkum, which owns tournament wins over Davis and Pioneer, fell to 1-2 in the TCC. 

“Our gameplan was to minimize their middle attack,” Nicdao said. “We were very successful in the first set and in the second set they made a good adjustment.” 
  
Ultimately X’s and O’s were less important for the Wolves than was their inner fortitude. 

“(Before the fourth set) I told the girls to play smarter and we need to bring our mental toughness on every attack and every reception and minimize our errors,” Nicdao said. 

Luchessi finished with 10 kills and five solo blocks. Setter Cassidy Schreiner, one match after setting a school record with 52 assists, had 48 assists, six service points and an ace against the Tigers. 

Natalie Butterfield had 15 digs, two aces and eight service points, Sam Ibbetson had five blocks and four kills and both Shaye conley and Tori Maichel were 14 for 15 serving.

4a8ef36c-4e71-49f9-a34d-5689285c4d3c,"Coldwell Banker Commercial Affiliates Survey Reveals Consumer Expectations for Same-Day Delivery, Use of Mobile Wallet Shaping Retail Experience",News,Vision Monday,"MADISON, N.J. , Sept. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- As mobile wallets and same-day online delivery become a cornerstone in the modern shopping experience, commercial real estate is quickly adapting to meet the warehousing and retail needs expected from consumers. A  Coldwell Banker Commercial Affiliates survey, conducted by Harris Poll and released today, explores how retail expectations and habits have recently changed and how Millennials (ages 18-34), Gen Xers (ages 35-49) and Baby Boomers (ages 50-69) prefer to shop online and in stores. 

The survey of over 2,000 U.S. adults found that the in-store and online shopping experience is evolving with the emergence of mobile wallet platforms and the availability of same-day delivery. Millennials lead the trend and are most likely to expect these conveniences when shopping, validating the importance of an omni-channel option for retailers. Though convenient e-commerce options are expanding, the data also reflected a continued affinity towards the traditional in-store shopping experience, especially from Millennials. 
   
""Retailers are moving closer to consumers, and the supply chain is rapidly evolving to accommodate this,"" Fred Schmidt, president and chief operating officer of Coldwell Banker Commercial Affiliates, said. ""Shoppers still value the traditional in-person experience but expect efficiency and expediency. These generational trends help paint a clearer picture for commercial real estate of where warehousing and inventory space may be headed, as well as how traditional retail space is evolving."" 

U.S. Consumers Expect Convenience When Shopping Online and Experience When Shopping in a Store 

Same-day delivery options, as well as delivery convenience options such as Amazon Dash push-to-buy buttons, are transforming online shopping habits and engraining the expectation of retail convenience. Half (50 percent) of U.S. adults are more likely to make a purchase online if there is a same-day delivery option, and 40 percent expect this option to be available when shopping online. Overall, the option of same day delivery is more likely to drive the purchasing decisions of Millennials and parents with children under 18 living in their household (hereafter referred to as ""parents"") than other generations and segments of the population. 
Millennials are more likely to make a purchase online if there is a same-day delivery option (64 percent) compared to other generations (56 percent for Gen Xers and 40 percent for Baby Boomers). Same-day delivery is significantly more likely to make parents make a purchase online (63 percent) than nonparents (46 percent). 50 percent of parents expect the option of same day delivery when making a purchase online, compared to just 36 percent of nonparents. 
This is not to say that the in-store experience is obsolete. Overall, 69 percent of U.S. adults prefer to make their purchases in a store, and it's the experience that keeps them coming back. 
72 percent of Millennials say they prefer shopping in a store, compared to 65 percent of Gen Xers and 68 percent of Boomers. In addition, Millennials are much more likely (73 percent) than other generations to enjoy the experience of being in a store or mall, compared to 58 percent of Gen Xers and just 48 percent of Boomers. 
The trend towards same-day delivery is already shifting suppliers' inventory needs. As same-day delivery pilot programs begin to surface in urban areas, retailers are quickly acquiring warehouse space immediately outside large urban areas to meet the burgeoning demand. As these same-day delivery programs become national, the demand for these warehouses is likely to continue in both urban and suburban areas. 

U.S. Consumers Are Growing Fond of Mobile Wallet Technologies 

While the concept of mobile wallets is still somewhat of a novelty, Millennials and parents of young children are more open to embracing this type of technology. 
One in three (33 percent) Millennials agree that making purchases with a mobile wallet (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Visa PayWave) is important to them, compared to only 21 percent of the total survey population. Similarly, parents are nearly twice as likely to feel that making purchases with a mobile wallet is important, 33 percent of parents compared to just 17 percent of nonparents. 
""As mobile payment systems evolve, physical retail space will continue to adapt,"" added Schmidt. ""Technology provides new opportunities to improve the overall in-store and checkout experience for retailers and consumers alike."" 

As Millennials and parents, who may be shopping with their hands full, push demand for the simplicity and speed of mobile payments, brick and mortar retailers can redefine the space and experience of their stores by moving -- or even removing -- cash registers, shortening check-out lines and satisfying this shift in demand. 

""The advances in retail technology and the conveniences associated with them are driving our commercial real estate needs,"" continued Schmidt. ""Commercial real estate professionals should pay attention to how these tools and trends develop and continue to think about how they will revolutionize the consumer experience."" 

Full survey findings are available on the Coldwell Banker Commercial website. 

Methodology 
This survey was conducted online within the United States from July 28-30, 2015 among 2,045 adults ages 18 and older, by Harris Poll on behalf of Coldwell Banker Commercial Affiliates via its Quick Query omnibus product. Figures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. Propensity score weighting was used to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online. 

All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments. Therefore, Harris Poll avoids the words ""margin of error"" as they are misleading. All that can be calculated are different possible sampling errors with different probabilities for pure, unweighted, random samples with 100% response rates. These are only theoretical because no published polls come close to this ideal. 

Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in Harris Poll surveys. The data have been weighted to reflect the composition of the adult population. Because the sample is based on those who agreed to participate in the Harris Poll panel, no estimates of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.

""I'm like, 'Oh, OK,'"" Konta recalled thinking. ""We've been here for a while.""

The longest women's match in US Open history consumed three hours, 23 minutes on court 17, where Konta, a 24-year-old Briton, nibbled on bananas. She recalled the teachings of Juan Coto, her mental coach. And she ultimately persevered through the conditions to oust ninth-seeded Muguruza, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (7-4), 6-2.

""I left everything out there,"" said Konta, ranked No.97 in the world.

The loss was another recent disappointment for Muguruza, who has won only one match in three tournaments since reaching the final at Wimbledon.

""I think I am very tough on myself sometimes,"" said Muguruza, who committed 59 unforced errors. ""It's hard when you lose. It's always been like this.""

Muguruza said she could sense early in the match that Konta believed in herself, perhaps for good reason. In June, at a tune-up for Wimbledon, Konta defeated Muguruza in three sets. Konta later had the misfortune of facing Maria Sharapova in the first round at Wimbledon (Sharapova won easily), but Konta's confidence was growing. She has not lost since.

Her latest victory improved her winning streak to 15, although she has not faced a ton of top-notch competition. Ahead of the Open, she won two second-tier tournaments in Canada, where just two of her 10 opponents ranked among the top 100. At the Open, she won three matches in qualifying before defeating Louisa Chirico in the first round of the main draw.

""Every opponent is a new opponent,"" Konta said when asked about her winning streak, noting that none of them care how many matches she has won.

She added, ""You know, I am going to lose sooner or later. I'm not invincible. I'm no Serena Williams.""

Against Muguruza, Konta survived plenty of stressful situations (15 games went to deuce) and some adversity at the end of the second set. Trailing in the tiebreaker, 5-3, Konta was serving when Muguruza's return was called long. The ruling was overturned after a successful challenge by Muguruza. But rather than have the two players replay the point, the chair umpire awarded it to Muguruza, saying that the original out call had been late enough that Konta - who had missed her next shot - should not have been impaired by it.

Konta was upset, but her protests were pointless. Muguruza quickly closed out the tiebreaker to send the match to a third set.

""Obviously, I had my own opinion of it,"" Konta said, ""but you're always going to have tense moments and tense times of the match.""

Given the circumstances and the heat, Konta could have folded like a souffle. Instead, she broke Muguruza's serve to start the third set and then broke her again to race out to a 4-0 lead, which proved insurmountable. After Muguruza's forehand sailed long on match point, Konta braced the top of her head with her hand, as if she were afraid she would float away.

""This is what we train for,"" said Konta, a baseliner who leans on her fitness. ""This is why we put the hours in that we do. This is not my first rodeo with a 3 1/2-hour match.""

The victory was, without question, the most significant of her career. In the third round, she is scheduled to face No. 18 Andrea Petkovic.

3f1bee63-4006-48bc-9087-844e3c8e6a17,CTC Media Enters Into Definitive Agreement to Sell a 75% Interest in Its Operating Businesses to UTH Russia for $200 Million,News,Reuters,"MOSCOW, Sept.  25, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CTC Media, Inc. (""CTC Media"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:CTCM), Russia's leading independent media company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell a 75% interest in its operating businesses to UTV-Management LLC, an affiliate of UTH Russia (""UTH""), a leading private commercial television broadcaster in Russia, for $200 million in cash, subject to adjustment as described below. The transaction is being undertaken to ensure compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by Russia’s new Mass Media Law, while maximizing the potential return to the Company's stockholders. The Company had previously announced its receipt of a formal, non-binding offer from UTH on July 6, 2015. 


The Board of Directors of CTC Media will recommend that the Company’s stockholders approve the transaction at a special meeting to be convened as soon as possible. The transaction is expected to close in late December 2015. MTG Russia, the Company’s largest stockholder, holding approximately 38% of the Company’s common stock, has indicated that it is prepared to support the transaction based on the terms of the agreement with UTH and the ability of the Company to return value to stockholders, all as described below. 

Werner Klatten, an independent member of the Board of Directors of CTC Media and Chairman of the Special Committee of the Board, commented: ""We are pleased to have reached agreement with UTH on the proposed sale of a controlling interest in our operating businesses. This agreement represents a significant achievement in light of the extremely challenging environment in which the Company is operating in Russia and the pending effectiveness of the Mass Media Law. Although it is unfortunate that Russian law will require that we effect a sale of the operating businesses, we believe that UTH will be a good new owner of the business and will be well positioned to build on the historical success of CTC Media as the first and leading commercial broadcasting network in Russia."" 

Yuliana Slashcheva, Chief Executive Officer of CTC Media , noted: ""The sale agreement will enable the management team to focus on the business, with the issue of compliance with the Mass Media Law resolved. We operate in a very challenging market environment, but I am confident that as part of UTH our operating businesses will remain strongly positioned to build on our historical achievements as we continue to set new standards in media entertainment across Russia and Kazakhstan."" 

Return of Value to Stockholders 

Following the closing of the sale of the 75% interest to UTH, the Board intends to return value in cash to the Company’s stockholders (other than Telcrest, for so long as it remains subject to sanctions). The Board is finalizing its plans in this regard, and expects to seek approval of a further transaction to effect such return of value in a proxy statement to be provided to stockholders in connection with the special meeting. Depending on the amount of consideration actually received in the transaction, which will reflect the operating performance of the business in the remainder of 2015 and other factors described below, the Board currently anticipates that the amount that will be available to stockholders (other than Telcrest, for so long as it remains subject to sanctions) would represent a low double-digit premium to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market on September 24, 2015, which was $1.89. The Board currently anticipates that a transaction to effect the return of value to Company stockholders will be completed in the first quarter of 2016. 

Terms of the Transaction 

Pursuant to the purchase agreement, CTC Media has agreed to sell a 75% interest in CTC Investments LLC (""CTC Investments""), the Company’s wholly-owned Russian subsidiary, which in turn directly or indirectly owns the group’s operating subsidiaries in Russia and Kazakhstan. In addition, the Company has agreed to approve the issuance by CTC Investments to UTH of an additional, new participation interest in CTC Investments following the closing of the transaction, resulting in UTH holding 80% of CTC Investments. Such additional interest would be issued to UTH by CTC Investments in consideration of a promissory note, and is intended to ensure that the ownership structure of the operating business fully meets the 80% ownership requirement of the Mass Media Law by the stated deadlines. 

The ultimate purchase price will be net of any shortfall in cash flow from operating and investing activities during the second half of 2015 compared with the Company’s forecast for this period, and is subject to adjustment in connection with certain defined indemnification obligations. In addition, prior to closing the Company will receive all existing cash in the operating businesses, in excess of $15 million agreed to be retained for working capital post-closing. The Company currently expects that the amount of available cash from the operating businesses will be $55 million. 

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the approval of the Company’s stockholders by a simple majority of the outstanding shares of common stock at a special meeting. The shares of the Company common stock held by Telcrest Investments, the holder of 25% of the Company’s common stock, are currently blocked pursuant to U.S. economic sanctions and as such Telcrest would not be permitted to vote at the special meeting. The Board intends to issue a proxy statement in respect of the special meeting as soon as possible. 

Background 

The Board of Directors of CTC Media has decided to approve and recommend the UTH transaction in the context of the pending effectiveness of amendments to the Russian law ""On Mass Media"". This law will, among other things, impose a requirement that at least 80% of the ownership interest in registered mass media in Russia, including television broadcasters, be beneficially owned and controlled by Russian persons or entities, effective January 1, 2016. The current ownership of the CTC group by CTC Media, a Delaware corporation that is now majority-owned by non-Russian entities, would not comply with the requirements of this new law. 

As previously announced, the Board of Directors has undertaken an exhaustive process since the introduction of the Mass Media Law in the second half of 2014 to identify alternatives that would allow the Company to achieve compliance with the law while best safeguarding the interests of the Company’s stockholders. The Board has concluded that the only viable option is a divestment transaction. The Company and its financial advisors undertook a comprehensive formal auction process and subsequent one-on-one discussions with potentially interested buyers. The only viable offer received to date has been from UTH.

3470b5d3-1c93-4227-bdce-a13c891e100c,SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Reminds Shareholders With Losses on Their Investment in CaesarStone Sdot-Yam Ltd. of Class Action Lawsuit and Upcoming Deadline – CSTE,News,Benzinga.com,"NEW YORK, Sept. 11, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against CaesarStone Sdot-Yam Ltd. (""Caesarstone"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: CSTE) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and docketed under 15-cv-06726, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased CaesarStone securities between March 25, 2013 and August 18, 2015 inclusive (the ""Class Period""). This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ""Exchange Act""). 

If you are a shareholder who purchased CaesarStone securities during the Class Period, you have until October 26, 2015 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.

CaesarStone manufactures and sells engineered quartz surfaces under the CaesarStone brand in the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Europe, and internationally. The Company's products are engineered quartz slabs, which are used as kitchen countertops in the renovation and remodeling, and residential construction end markets, as well as other applications, including vanity tops, wall panels, back splashes, floor tiles, stair, and other interior surfaces that are used in various residential and non-residential applications. It sells its products directly to fabricators, sub-distributors, and resellers; and indirectly through a network of independent distributors.

The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) that the cost of quartz rose substantially by approximately 20% in 2014 while the Company claimed in SEC filings the impact of the price increase was just 4%; (ii) independent lab tests demonstrate that CaesarStone's samples contained less quartz than advertised; (iii) CaesarStone's reported consolidated margins, gross margins, and EBITDA were overstated; (iv) the extent of and risk posed by a growing number of lawsuits for approximately 60 silicosis-related injuries or deaths suffered by workers and fabricators of its product in Israel was understated; vi) the impact recent OSHA warnings regarding silicosis would have on the opening of a new U.S. facility and associated costs; (vii) recent inspection reports revealed audit deficiencies related to revenue and inventory controls; and (viii) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' statements about CaesarStone's business, operations, and prospects were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

On August 19, 2015, analyst firm Spruce Point Capital Management published a report on CaesarStone describing the aforementioned false and misleading statements and failures of disclosure. On this adverse news, CaesarStone ADRs fell $3.68, or 7.6%, to close at $44.61 on August 19, 2015.

68d9e6f7-5dc2-48f8-91eb-3bc38b504c7e,"Rangers pound A's, 10-3",News,Marin Independent Journal,"OAKLAND -- The A's aren't providing much spoiler resistance to the Texas Rangers' ongoing September surge toward the American League West title. 
  
After a loss a day earlier, Oakland took its usual submissive approach against veteran Rangers right-hander Colby Lewis in a 10-3 beating Tuesday night before 16,445 at the Coliseum. 
  
The Rangers now have a season-best three-game lead in the A.L. West with 11 games to go after being eight games out of the division lead as late as Aug. 1. Just as important, Texas is building a cushion going into a three-game weekend series at Houston. 
  
The A's are the flip side of the record. With a fourth straight loss that dropped them to 64-88, they're steaming their way toward locking up the A.L.'s worst record and their first 90-loss season in 17 years -- or the duration of the Billy Beane Era as general manager. 
 
 
  
As has been the case in so many games with Oakland since Beane gutted the roster before the trade deadline -- the A's have only won 13 of their last 39 contests -- this was a grim affair. 
  
Josh Reddick hit his 20th homer but committed two errors in right field, a rarity for the former Gold Glove winner. Billy Burns hit a fifth-inning triple that set an Oakland club record (41), but in an apropos statement about this season, Burns didn't wind up scoring. Eric Sogard hit his first homer of the year, but it was a solo shot and came too late to have much impact. 
  
Then there was starter Felix Doubront. The left-hander came into the game with gory career numbers against Texas -- 0-5 with a 12.68 ERA and a .427 opponents' batting average, but that ERA actually went up to 12.82 after Doubront was pounded for seven runs in 42/3 innings, including three-run home runs to Elvis Andrus in the fourth and Adrian Beltre in the fifth. 
  
Doubront (3-3) allowed just a hit and a walk over his first three innings. But after Oakland gave him a 1-0 lead on a Carson Blair RBI single in the bottom of the third, he caved in the top of the fourth. After striking out Shin-Soo Choo to start the inning, he surrendered consecutive singles to Beltre, Prince Fielder and Mitch Moreland, Moreland's hit tying the score at 1-1. 
  
Andrus then launched his seventh homer of the season -- and the first three-run homer of his career -- over the 388-foot sign in left-center field, and it was 4-1 Rangers. 
  
That probably would have sufficed for Lewis (17-8), who is 3-0 against the A's this year and 11-4 lifetime. But it turned out to be a breeze when the Rangers tacked on three more runs in the top of the fifth. Doubront allowed a leadoff double to Delino DeShields, walked Choo and then served up Beltre's 16th homer, a line shot to left. 
  
Lewis pitched six innings and allowed two runs, walking two and striking out three before giving way to Texas' deep bullpen. Sogard greeted Lewis' replacement, Sam Freeman, with a second-pitch homer to right in the bottom of the seventh. The blast ended a 457 at-bat, 141-game homerless streak for the veteran Oakland infielder. 
  
Texas scored two runs in the ninth, one on Rougned Odor's 15th homer. 
  
""I don't wish that on my worst enemy,"" Vogt said. ""It was the worst 10 days of my life, and I don't ever want to go through it again."" 
  
Vogt has been catching bullpens, and all he's waiting for is clearance from the training staff. He wants to get behind the plate as often as possible the rest of the way. 
  
""Obviously, I'd like to catch one more time at home,"" he said. ""It would mean a lot to me personally. Get the flinching and the nervousness out of the way, so I'm going into the winter thinking, 'OK, I got back in there, I'm fine.' For me, it's a hurdle I'd like to get over sooner than later."" 
  
Stewart will be on hand to present Vogt with the community service award before Thursday night's game.",685,"OAKLAND -- The A's aren't providing much spoiler resistance to the Texas Rangers' ongoing September surge toward the American League West title.

2e1da685-2f11-48de-8b09-e393763c4ca3,Friday’s Red Sox-Blue Jays matchups: Rick Porcello vs. Marcus Stroman,News,WEEI 93.7 FM,"Rick Porcello 
 
The Red Sox head to Toronto on Friday for a matchup with the AL East-leading Blue Jays, and they’ll send Rick Porcello to the mound opposite Marcus Stroman in the opener of a three-game series. 
 
Porcello (8-12, 5.06 ERA) is 3-1 with a 2.15 ERA in four starts since returning from a stint on the disabled list (strained right triceps). In his last outing on Saturday against the Rays — best known as the night David Ortiz hit his 500th home run — Porcello pitched seven innings, allowing three runs on five hits and three walks with eight strikeouts. 
 
Porcello last faced the Jays on Sept. 7 and picked up the win after allowing four runs (three earned) on eight hits and two walks in 7 1/3 innings as the Sox rolled to an 11-4 victory. In his last start in Toronto on July 1, an 11-2 Red Sox loss, Porcello allowed seven runs in two innings on seven hits and a hit batsman. In four career starts north of the border, Porcello is 1-3 with a 7.65 ERA. 
 

 
Marcus Stroman 
 
Stroman (2-0, 5.40 ERA) will be making just his second start of the season. The 24-year-old right-hander tore his left ACL during a spring training fielding drill in March and only returned last weekend. In a Saturday start against the Yankees , Stroman pitched four no-hit innings before giving up a three-run home run in the fifth, his final inning of work. He picked up the win after allowing four hits, two walks and one hit batsman while striking out two. 
 
“Unbelievable. Complete team effort on both ends,” Stroman said after the 10-7 victory. “The vibes, the camaraderie in the clubhouse couldn’t be any better.” 
 
As a rookie last year Stroman went 11-6 with a 3.65 ERA, making 20 starts and six relief appearances. In three starts against the Red Sox he went 3-0 with a 1.25 ERA. 
 
Stroman, the 22nd overall pick in the 2012 draft out of Duke, is especially tough at home, going 7-2 with a 1.98 ERA and .196 opponents’ batting average in 11 starts. Add to that the fact that the Blue Jays are 19-5 at home since July 29, and the Red Sox have their work cut out for them. However, Boston has had some success in Toronto, winning three of four games during a series from June 29-July 2.

""This is the kind of stuff that happens to the visiting team in Gillette Stadium all the time. From the start of the game through the opening 14 minutes of the first quarter, the Steelers’ coaches’ headsets were receiving the Patriots Radio Network broadcast of the game. The broadcast was so loud that the Steelers coaches were unable to communicate, and the NFL rule is that if one team’s headsets are not working the other team is supposed to be forced to take their headsets off. It’s what the NFL calls the Equity Rule,"" wrote Bob Labriola of steelers.com before dropping more. 

""Strangely enough, whenever an NFL representative proceeded to the New England sideline to shut down their headsets, the Steelers headsets cleared. Then as the representative walked away from the New England sideline, the Steelers’ headsets again started to receive the Patriots game broadcast."" 

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin was clearly peeved after the game saying communication outages at Gillette are ""always the case."" 

According to a Yahoo! report , the Steelers plan to file a complaint with the NFL for the failure of the headsets and for the league's failure to turn off New England's communications while Pittsburgh was experiencing its intermittent outages.

50c91984-778c-4ecd-a9e8-4cb151cc5614,The Martian: Matt Damon's new space film started as a self-published e-book,News,Gloucester Advocate,"Matt Damon's new outerspace romp The Martian may look like a blockbuster dreamt up by a Hollywood studio, but the film actually started as a self-published e-book. Matt Damon's new outerspace romp The Martian may look like a blockbuster dreamt up by a Hollywood studio, but the film began as an e-book published by a self-confessed ""dork"".

The new Ridley Scott action flick - out November - features Damon as a NASA astronaut stranded on Mars after he is presumed dead by his crew mates following a severe storm on the small planet.

The epic tale of survival had humble beginnings in 2009 as a self-published e-book written by San Francisco computer programmer, Andy Weir.

Weir's obsession with problem-solving inspired him to plan the logistics of a mission to Mars - just for fun.

After researching what a human would need to do to survive on the red planet, Weir came up with the story of Mark Watney, a stranded astronaut using all his scientific knowledge to survive.

The computer programmer began posting the story on his website, chapter by chapter, when it gained a cult following.

""I wasn't writing for a mainstream audience,"" Weir . ""I was writing for this core group of extremely technical, science-minded dorks like me. I'm one of those guys that'll nitpick every little physics problem in a movie. I absolutely am.

""I had chemists, electrical engineers emailing me, and a reactor tech on a US nuclear submarine, just telling me how this stuff works.

""It was really nice because I didn't have any contacts in aerospace at the time. I didn't know anyone in NASA, so all my research was on Google.""

In 2012, he posted the novel, called The Martian, on Amazon's Kindle site after receiving several requests from fans.

Eighteen months later, Weir was negotiating both a publishing deal with Random House and film rights with Fox.

""At this point I'm still sitting in my cubicle at work, fixing bugs,"" he said, ""Then wandering off to take a call about my movie or book deals.""

When Alien and Gladiator director Ridley Scott and Damon signed-on to the project, the programmer couldn't believe it.

""I just felt disbelief, really. There must be a moment when people who've won the lottery stare at the ticket for a minute and go, 'No, I must be misreading this',"" he said.

Perhaps the funniest part of this story is that Weir himself has an intense fear of flying, and while consulting on the film, never met his publisher, his agent, or anyone from the film company.

After becoming a New York Times bestselling author, he resigned from his job as a computer programmer, and is working on a new book and developing a TV series.

In April, NASA invited Weir to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and after overcoming his fear of flying, described the trip as the best week of his life.

""Other kids fantasise about being astronauts, I fantasised about being a mission controller,"" he said.

A recent flurry of cancelled appointments at the clinic had sparked fears amongst patients that the service would close, according to Helensburgh and Lomond MSP Jackie Baillie. 
 
The Labour politician has written to NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to demand clarity over the future of the specialist clinic after receiving a number of calls and emails from patients whose appointments have been cancelled. It is understood that there are now no appointments at the Vale in October. 
 
The consultant who supported the blood clinic at the Vale of Leven Hospital has transferred to the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow and staff have not yet been told what will happen to local patients previously seen at the Vale. 
 
In her letter Ms Baillie has asked health board chief Robert Calderwood to put an end to the uncertainty and announce whether the clinic will remain open after this month. 
 
Ms Baillie said: “The provision of clinics was a key promise in the Vision for the Vale so I was hugely concerned when numerous patients got in touch with me to say that their appointments at the blood clinic have been cancelled. It is simply unacceptable that staff and patients have been kept in the dark about the health board’s plans for the future of the clinic following the transfer of a consultant to the new Queen Elizabeth hospital. 
 
“I have written to Robert Calderwood, chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, to ask why the October appointments have been cancelled and will oppose any attempts to remove the blood pressure clinic from the Vale. I will continue to fight for the North of the River health service that local people deserve and that means more clinics and appointments being delivered at the Vale of Leven Hospital.” 
 
A spokeswoman for NHSGGC said: “A specialist cardio vascular service, which is provided jointly with the University of Glasgow, has been established at the new Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) to provide patients with modern healthcare and treatment. 
 
“We are reviewing the care of patients who have been attending the Vale of Leven blood pressure clinic, which affects approximately two patients a week, for a number of years. 
 
“If their condition is stable they will be discharged back to their GP to have their blood pressure checked regularly at their local surgery.  However if their condition requires further specialist treatment they will be referred to the new cardio vascular service at the QEUH.” 
 
When asked by the Advertiser if the clinic was to close, the NHSGGC spokeswoman added: “Patients are being reviewed and once this is complete the need for a local clinic will have gone.”",460,"The Vale of Leven Hospital’s blood pressure clinic services are to close as soon as next month.

The Federal Government had nine years ago requested the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the environmental and public health impacts of oil contamination in Ogoniland, Rivers State, together with options for remediation.

Last month, President Muhammadu Buhari approved actions to fast-track the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report on clean-up of Ogoniland.

The approval was based on recommendations by the Executive Director of UNEP, the programme's Special Representative for Ogoniland, Permanent Secretaries of the Federal Ministries of Environment and Petroleum Resources, and other stakeholders.

He said $10 million would be made available by stakeholders within 30 days of the appointment of members of the Board of Trustees for the Trust Fund who will be responsible for collecting and managing funds from contributors and donors.

But speaking at a press conference at the weekend in Lagos, Weli said security should be given utmost reflection, adding that while efforts have been on to remedy the situation some unwholesome activities are still ongoing.

He told newsmen the company has tried as much as possible to comply with the recommendation of the UNEP though overall action ought to be driven by government.

20d24229-6d25-4a0a-9b2c-0c9956d1801a,A Chinese view on fixing the Japan relationship,Blog,East Asia Forum,"Author: Zha Daojiong, Peking University 
 
Evidence of a strain in the diplomatic relationship between China and Japan over the past few years has been most apparent in the absence of summits between top government leaders, which has in turn affected routine meetings at the ministerial level. It seems that Beijing still has not overcome its diplomatic ‘Noda shock’. What hope, then, is there for an improvement in this relationship? 
 

 
In September 2012, the very day after his meeting with then Chinese president Hu Jintao on the sidelines of APEC in Vladivostok, then Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda announced the nationalisation of some of the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. For many in China, it was an unfathomable shock that a Japanese leader was so ready to disregard a Chinese leader’s domestic political circumstances or, seen another way, to mount such an outright challenge to his authority at home. Since then, high-level meetings have ground to a halt, the brief and visibly uncomfortable meeting between President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Abe on the side of APEC 2014 in Beijing notwithstanding. 
 
To resume such meetings, bilaterally, trilaterally (China–Japan–South Korea) or on the side of multilateral forums, is of course in China’s interest in pursuit of a less tense external environment. But the true test is how to effectively signal their utility to respective domestic constituencies. For Beijing, Tokyo and indeed Seoul, several years of domestic acrimony on such sensitive issues as territorial sovereignty and wartime history has been such that it has put all countries’ leaders between a rock and a hard place. A prudent act of leadership now would be to gear domestic attitudes on such delicate issues towards strategic patience. This is not an easy task, yet it is essential for even a photo-op meeting to be worthwhile at all. 
 
The history issue is often said, by those in both China and Japan tasked to find ways out of the continuing impasse, to be the key roadblock to progress. Over time, hope for government-sponsored joint versions of the history of World War II has faded to the point where there ought to be consideration of even dropping the entire project. 
 
China, ideally, should come up with the intellectual fortitude to publicise domestically Japan’s post-war contributions towards China’s pursuit of modernisation. In the 1950s, while locked in Cold War hostility towards the Chinese government, the Japanese government allowed limited trade activities to proceed when the former was under broad Western isolation in the wake of the Korean War. Official development assistance from Japan played a powerfully supportive role in China’s re-linking with the rest of the world economy, and not only in a material sense. Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, the fact that China and Japan were able to work cooperatively in trade and investment relations was seen as a vote of confidence in China by other industrialised nations. 
 
China could not have succeeded in improving its relative economic position, were it not for the foundation laid in these early years. Sure, China did pay back its yen loans, but this history of economic aid still merits recognition. 
 
To do this is, fundamentally speaking, in the interest of the Chinese polity itself. Indeed, for the past two years the phenomenon of increasing numbers of Chinese tourists travelling to Japan even against the backdrop of difficult government-to-government diplomacy can and should serve as a reminder: government-sanctioned versions of Japan are being tested. As is true in other societies, for the average citizen, while remembering an intolerable past is important, it can hardly be the only dimension of a relationship with another society. The Chinese nation-building project could benefit immensely from narrowing the unspoken gaps between accounts of pre-1945 Japanese atrocities in China and present-day sentiments about Japan that its citizens gather through personal observation and interactions. 
 
Likewise, Japan needs to demonstrate political courage and argue that the time has come for its government to finally stay clear of efforts to whitewash what the country did in China and the Korean peninsula during the war. Yes, the Japanese political system is far more pluralistic. But how the Japanese polity projects the country’s past to its own citizenry has been, is and will be taken into account by other countries, especially those that once suffered. Japan should beware of the future costs that the ongoing diplomatic tensions carry. A truly wise approach would be to re-orient domestic conversations about the past and their present-day relevance for the nation itself. 
 
With China’s formal celebration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II behind us, Beijing and Tokyo should proceed by making progress on economic cooperation initiatives that have stalled in recent years. Reinvigorated negotiations toward a China–Japan–Korea free trade agreement give rise to hope that this useful addition will eventuate. In many ways it would be a natural follow-on to the trilateral investment treaty signed in 2012. It would signal that the Chinese and Japanese leaderships are indeed committed to being future-oriented in their handling of the relationship. 
 
The past few years have also witnessed both Beijing and Tokyo testing their separate capacities in building up respective coalitions of the willing in the East Asian region and even beyond, over issues ranging from investment to maritime order. Factors feeding into this race include changes in United States policy as well as campaigns by some Southeast Asian governments, those of the Philippines and Vietnam in particular. For China, Japan and indeed the United States, it is becoming more and more obvious that no party can prevail in attempting to re-engineer the regional security and economic order as textbook geostrategic and geoeconomic mapping would suggest. 
 
One suggestion is for China and Japan is to take a page out of Australia’s book in its handling of its security relationships. By conducting joint exercises, however low-level, with the US and Chinese militaries, Australia has demonstrated that the principle of inclusivity can play a role in handling the mixture of strategic competition and cooperation in the region. The Australian approach amounts to a separation of military affairs from economic ones. China and Japan should explore similar projects involving Southeast Asian countries. 
 
Above all, positive synergy is what really matters in rescuing government-to-government interaction between China and Japan from its present downward spiral. Achieving this requires boldness, wisdom and the utmost care when making every move. After a four-decade long history of uninterrupted economic and societal interactions between China, Japan and other countries across the Asia Pacific region, there has to be ample political will to take the relationship between Beijing and Tokyo on to a more positive path.

In this home designed for his family, architect Jake Edgley of Edgley Design decided to preserve and valorise the century-old tree, the last survivor of an orchard from the Victorian Age, and transformed it into the cornerstone of the whole project.
The ground floor was therefore designed as a path / walkway between indoors and outdoors. To save the pear tree, the home was divided into two volumes linked by a covered glass walkway. The tree is a living sculpture that is the natural protagonist of the inner courtyard, which brings air and light to the central spaces of the home.
The ground floor is in exposed concrete and its pale colour contrasts with the volume of the first floor that houses the bedrooms and is covered with dark wood panels that highlight its vertical nature. Using different vertical elements, as architect Jake Edgley explains, aims to re-evoke the memory of looking through the trees, like in an orchard.(Agnese Bifulco)

The Masters and US Open champion has the chance to cap his unforgettable year on Sunday with another prized trophy, which with it would bring a bonus of 10 million US dollars. 
  Jordan Spieth leads the Tour Championship   
And he put himself in the leading position by crafting and grafting his way to a two-under 68, his putter becoming hot at the end of the round, helping Spieth out of trouble and ahead of long-time leader Henrik Stenson. 

			 
The pair will duel for glory over the closing 18 holes, with Spieth beginning the final round on eight under par and Stenson one back. 



 
Stenson began the day nine under, and at the turn he was on the same mark, but a shaky second nine holes played in two over par saw the 39-year-old Swede open the door for Spieth. 

A terrific escape from trouble at the 16th hole, after a birdie at the previous hole, was the trigger moment for Spieth's surge from second place, two shots back, to his one-shot overnight lead. 

The 22-year-old American  went horribly right off the tee at 16 and knew he was in trouble.  He punched the ball out of immediate trouble to gain a sight of the flag, then with a pitch that was no more than adequate gave himself a 22-foot chance of par. 

Spieth drained the putt into the heart of the hole, and an impressive two-putt for par from long range at 17, bogeyed by Stenson who found sand, set him up for a crack at the lead at the short last. 

			 
From 20 feet, Spieth nailed another pressure putt for birdie, with Stenson only able to make par. 

What Rory McIlroy would have given for birdie, or even par, at the last. 

Having played well to reach two under through 17 holes, and five under for the tournament, McIlroy butchered the par-three 18th, taking three shots to find the putting surface and then missing from close range for bogey. 

A par round of 70 left the Northern Irishman three under, n eeding something spectacular over the closing 18 holes. 

			 
Rickie Fowler's three-under 67, that lifted him to a tie for third with Paul Casey on four under, was the lowest anyone managed on Saturday. 

A rain warning prompted tournament organisers to bring forward tee times by over two hours. The wet weather  materialised and made conditions difficult, particularly around the rough, with Englishman Casey saying the course had become ""monstrously long"". 

Stenson's two-over 72 was unlike him on a course he loves. Two years ago the 39-year-old Swede led from start to finish to win the tournament and FedEx Cup title, with its 10million US dollars bonus, and there could still be a repeat on Sunday. 

The same money is on offer to the player who tops this year's FedEx Cup standings, with current race leader Jason Day only even par for this week's tournament and seemingly out of contention for either prize on offer. 

Spieth or Stenson would take the bumper reward should they win, with Fowler and McIlroy just about still in contention. 

			 
Barring an astounding turn of events, Casey cannot get into the frame for the eight-figure pay-out. 

Casey said of the course after his one-over 71: "" It was very, very difficult and it shows how good guys are playing this year that people are still shooting under par."" 

Speaking on Sky Sports, Casey added:  ""I'm playing for a Tour Championship and a five-year exemption, and a lot of money, whereas they're playing for an awful lot of money. 

""I don't see any way I can win a FedEx Cup tomorrow. It's not going to happen. But I've got my own competition I'm playing and I'd love to stir the pot by getting up there and winning it.""

LOS ANGELES –   Victoria Justice is one of the best known young actresses in Hollywood after starring turns on two Nickelodeon shows and scores of film roles. But Justice said she hasn't let the fame get to her head. 
 
“At the end of the day, I’m really focused on my work and what I do and that’s what’s really important to me, and I’m also not the type of person who is going to be out every night in the club, I’m not really party of that scene,” she told FOX411. “I would much rather stay at home and watch a documentary with my dog and family and friends.” 
 
She also praised her parents, saying Hollywood doesn't affect them. 
 
“I also live a pretty balanced grounded life and my parents are really involved in my life as well,"" she said. ""They are normal humble people who are not affected by this industry at all, which keeps me really grounded as well. My mom tells it like it is which is great!” 
 
Justice's next big project is the movie “Naomi & Ely’s No Kiss List,"" a coming-of-age story about two friends who’s bond is put to the test when they both fall for the same guy. Justice opened up about what it was like to play Naomi. 
 
“Naomi is definitely at a point in her life with a lot of change happening. She’s a freshman in college, she has a job to support herself and her mom, and she’s kinda losing one of her best friends, and I can relate to that vulnerability and everyone goes through changes,"" She said. ""And I can definitely relate to that aspect of becoming more independent within yourself and kinda taking charge of your life more.” 
 
The 22-year-old is also committed to giving back. 

“Ever since I was little both of my parents have always taught me to treat others the way you want to be treated,” she said. “Also the idea of being kind to others. I feel like especially with the position I am in and the fact that I have some people that look up to me and the social media presence it's really cool to give back in that way and reply to people and make them feel better about themselves.”

Alongside opening film Suffragette, which stars Oscar-winner Meryl Streep as Emeline Pankhurst, and American Express gala Carol, featuring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as lesbian lovers, there are other films showing women in front on screen and behind the cameras. 
 Carey Mulligan in Suffragette (Pathe/20th Century Fox) 
“It’s a strong year for strong roles for women across our headline galas. We have the great opportunity by opening with a stunning film like Suffragette to amplify the focus on what is happening for roles for women and girls, in terms of their representation in front of the camera,” she said. 
 
“Also, to look at the question of how women directors are currently faring as well. So we’ve chosen that as our focal point of our discussion in a year where we have a huge array of films on offer as ever.” 
 
With more than 235 films being shown at this year’s event, and 45 films directed by female filmmakers, it can be hard to narrow down which ones to watch. 
 
Here are Clare’s top film recommendations for this year. 
   Promoted stories   Suffragette  [embedded content] 
Suffragette, starring Meryl Streep, Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter, will kick off the opening night of the 2015 LFF with a star-studded premiere. 
 
“Suffragette is an urgent and compelling film – made by British women, about British women who changed the course of history and it is, quite simply, a film that everyone must see,” Clare said. 
 
The film, which is directed by Sarah Gavron and written by The Iron Lady’s Abi Morgan, opens in cinemas on October 12. 
 Carol  [embedded content] 
Directed by Todd Haynes, Carol – starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as two women who fall in love in 1950s New York – will have its UK premiere on October 14. 
 
Clare said: “Carol is a deeply romantic, emotionally honest love story and is also cinema at its most intoxicating and immaculate. It’s Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara falling in love.” 
 
The film will open in cinemas on November 27. 
 Trumbo  [embedded content] 
Jay Roach’s biopic about blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo is played out on the big screen here, with Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston as the titular character. 
 
He is supported by Dame Helen Mirren as US gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and Diane Lane as Trumbo’s wife Cleo Fincher. 
 
“Diane Lane and Helen Mirren – one holding, the other attacking the fort – in our Accenture gala Trumbo. Diane plays the character who really holds the fort while Trumbo’s in the firing line and Helen plays a character who’s very much attacking Trumbo,” Clare said. 
 
The film opens in cinemas on January 22, 2016. 
 Brooklyn  [embedded content] 
Saoirse Ronan takes the lead in John Crowley’s period drama, which has been written by Nick Hornby. The Irish star plays young Irish immigrant Eilis Lacey, who swaps her homegrown comforts for the intoxicating excitement of 1950s Brooklyn. 
 
Clare said: “Saiorse Ronan gives such an extraordinary performance in the heart-wrenching film Brooklyn, which is based on the Colm Toibin novel.” 
 
Brooklyn, which also stars Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Julie Walters, opens nationwide on November 6. 
 The Lady In The Van  [embedded content] 
Dame Maggie Smith portrays an eccentric homeless woman who parked her battered Bedford van in playwright Alan Bennett’s driveway – and then remained there for 15 years in the big-screen adaptation of his play. 
 Dame Maggie Smith in The Lady In The Van (Sony Pictures) 
Clare explained: “Maggie Smith is the irascible Miss Shepherd in The Lady In The Van, this woman of an indeterminate age who parks her van in Alan Bennett’s driveway and stays there for 15 years.” 
 
The film, which also stars Alex Jennings and appearances by Dominic Cooper, James Corden and Jim Broadbent, opens in cinemas on November 13. 
 Steve Jobs  [embedded content] 
Michael Fassbender may play the late Apple co-founder, with Seth Rogen as his partner Steve Wozniak, in Danny Boyle’s biopic, but it is Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman, a member of the original Mac team and the NeXT team, who steals the spotlight. 
 
Clare said: “Kate Winslet plays Joanna Hoffman in the Steve Jobs biopic, which is the closing film for the festival. This is a really stunning performance – she is the person who can hold her own against that iconoclastic leader (Jobs).” 
 
Steve Jobs, which closes the festival on October 28, will open nationwide on November 13. 
 He Named Me Malala  [embedded content] 
There is no one quite as extraordinary as Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani activist and Nobel-prize laureate. 
 
Davis Guggenheim’s documentary about the 18-year-old, who was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen after speaking for the girls’ education in her region of Swat Valley in Pakistan. 
 
The film opens nationwide on November 6. 
 Room  [embedded content] 
“Lenny Abrahamson’s amazing Room is based on the story by Emma Donoghue, who also wrote the script,” Clare explained. 
 
“It’s an extraordinary performance by Brie Larson as a woman who’s been living in captivity and bringing up her child, who was birthed by her kidnapper,” Clare explained. 
 
The big-screen adaptation, starring Jacob Tremblay as the young child Jacob, opens in cinemas nationwide on January 29, 2016.

617ae16f-9b9f-431c-b903-cca9e1bbcd0c,What it’s like to talk and play with the new Apple TV,News,Waterloo Region Record,"Apple's first update to its television set-top box in years, didn't get much attention Wednesday amid all the other shiny objects — the new iPhone, iPad Pro — on display. 
 

                            But the introduction of its sophisticated $200 set-top box may have been the most significant of the day, giving us a peek into the way Apple wants to interact with it customers in the future. 
 

                            I had the opportunity to play around with the Apple TV a little bit after the company's news conference, in a hands-on area at the auditorium in San Francisco. One thing is clear from those demos: Apple wants to be at the centre of your living room, perhaps giving back a little of the family time that we've lost while getting buried in our smartphone and tablet screens. Every part of the Apple TV has been designed to be shared, from its streamlined search features to its nascent gaming capabilities. 
 

                            The TV's redesigned remote makes navigating through your options very easy, whether you're sliding along the menus or using the dedicated Siri button to talk to Apple's voice assistant. 
 

                            Search is smooth, and complete — something that we quite frankly need as we pile on video subscription services and never quite know what's in any of them. You can ask questions that build on each other: one of the demonstrators showing the device in my demo asked Siri to ""Show me popular comedies,"" then followed up with ""Only ones with Zach Galifianakis."" (Siri actually got a little flummoxed by that request at first but — to be fair — the speaker did stumble a bit over his words. Galifianakis is not an easy name to say.) 
 

                            Siri's good on the Apple TV, but users should know that it's not totally the same program that you may have gotten used to on your mobile device. The searches here are limited to the Apple TV world — queries about entertainment content, the weather, etc. This Siri, at least for now, isn't going to know your schedule, or entertain you with snarky comebacks. It's all business here, though the program has learned a few new tricks. You can ask Siri to skip ahead or back in programs, or for sports scores and weather forecasts that show up in the bottom third of your video. 
 

                            Apple's also using the device as a way to approach the gaming world. As it stands, the TV will probably never be a gamer's console, but nice for families that want to drop a little bit of extra fun into the time they spend in their living rooms. The ability to play multiplayer games with people in the room, via the TV remote, iPhones or iPads is key — you could easily see an impromptu gaming tournament slipping into a family movie night. The TV will also let you hand off games between the iPhone, iPad and TV. 
 

                            It's a little unfair to compare this to the Xbox or the PlayStation. The Wii U, which is under far more threat from Apple given the apparent target market here, has a more advanced gameplay experience. That said, as game consoles move more toward providing entertainment options, it's possible that families with more casual gamers will face a choice between grabbing Apple's device or a game console. 
 

                            One feature that did not get mentioned at all in Wednesday's announcement was how much Apple TV would support Apple's HomeKit, the company's smart home platform. That would add yet another layer of usefulness to the little box. 
 

                            Right now, the biggest obstacle that Apple TV faces is content. While the firm locked up some good deals with Showtime and MLB.tv as well as with game studios such as Disney and Activision, it doesn't have anything that screams ""must-have"" quite yet. For now, Apple TV is a device without a partner — but that could all change if Apple launches its long-rumored streaming video service.",656,"Apple's first update to its television set-top box in years, didn't get much attention Wednesday amid all the other shiny objects — the new iPhone, iPad Pro — on display.

18bce9c3-b907-4aea-83c9-21bf0e69d5c2,Twin Atlantic announced as final Stand For Something Tour headliner,News,DIY Magazine,"It may be almost time for the first show of this year’s Dr. Martens Stand For Something Tour, in association with DIY but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still a few surprises in store. 

Already, this year’s edition of the tour is set to be a memorable one thanks to the likes of Dutch Uncles, Palma Violets, Lonely The Brave, The Wytches and Bury Tomorrow. There is, however, one final headliner left to be announced. 

Fresh from selling out the huge SSE Hydro Arena back in May, Glasgow’s Twin Atlantic will be returning to the, ahem, rather more intimate confines of Leeds’ Brudenell Social Club this October. That’s right: Twin Atantic will playing the tiny venue in Leeds, and it’s going to be incredible. 

“We’ve never played at that venue before,” admits the band’s Sam McTrusty ahead of their show, “so we’re looking forward to something new. We’ve played Leeds many many times and in fact it was one of the first cities in England that really gave us a fanbase outside Scotland and for that reason it will always feel special playing there. I also remember one of the first times we had a big crowd chanting “Yorkshire” over and over… I thought they were saying “you’re shit”. Good times!” 
    
What do you stand for, Twin Atlantic? 
           
“I stand for art and freedom in art. Using the boundaries as guidelines instead of limitations.” 
 
Sam McTrusty 
     
It’s not just the final headliner that we’re now revealing: there’s a whole supporting cast of bands to be announced too. First up, appearing alongside Dutch Uncles on the opening date of the tour are hometown boys, United Fruit, who’re already looking forward to performing for a Glaswegian crowd. 

“Playing your own town is always great,” the band’s Stuart Galbraith assures. “When we started we used to play shows in Glasgow all the time but when you start playing elsewhere you can’t really do as many so it’s cool when we play there now. Hopefully it’ll be “taps aff”!” 
    
What do you stand for, United Fruit? 
           
“Because sitting down all day gets boring.” 
 
Stuart Galbraith 
     
Next up, Best Friends will be joining forces with Palma Violets to take on Norwich - “Believe it or not, Lewis and I actually grew up near Norwich,” Tom Roper says, “so we have a lot of fond memories of the ‘Wales of the East’”) - before Roadrunner-signed punk rockers Creeper open up for Twin Atlantic in Leeds. “We’re very excited indeed!” enthuses frontman Will Gould. “It’s another thing we’re doing that’s completely blown our minds. It’s going to be amazing to play to that crowd and then to watch Twin Atlantic after with everyone else too!” 
    
What do you stand for, Best Friends? 
           
“Treating others as one would like others to treat oneself.” 
 
Tom Roper 
     
What do you stand for, Creeper? 
           
“We stand for all sorts of things, but mainly we stand for the people who don’t fit in anywhere else.” 
 
Will Gould 
     
By the time November rolls around, the tour will have hit the halfway mark, with Dublin-based Only Rivals poised to join in the fun in Belfast with Lonely The Brave - “We’re all massive fans of Lonely The Brave,” says Steve Arkins, “so it’s an honour to be sharing a stage with them, we’ve been wanting to play a show with those guys for a long time.” - while the grungy Demob Happy will be accompanying the sheer loudness of The Wytches in Sheffield. “Quandaries aside, they rock hard,” Matt Marcantonio says simply of the headliners, “so it’ll be guitars at dawn.” 
    
What do you stand for, Only Rivals? 
           
“Being true to ourselves and trying to be the best band we can possibly be. Also, burritos. We stand for burritos.” 
 
Steve Arkins 
     
What do you stand for, Demob Happy? 
           
“‘Cus otherwise we’d fall down.” 
 
Matt Marcantonio 
     
Finally, as the tour draws to a close in the country’s capital, Camden’s Our Black Heart will play host to both Bury Tomorrow and Heck, who were previously known as those chaotic noise merchants Baby Godzilla. “The Black Heart is pretty much as up close and personal as it can get!” laughs Heck’s Matt Reynolds. “The last time we were let loose in the place was for our four day residency there a couple of years ago and it was like a fucking massacre. This time I hear the place is already sold out. Expect war.” 
    
What do you stand for, Heck? 
           
“No compromise.” 
 
Matt Reynolds

c373a3df-6c99-439c-be14-acf2af7b8e22,Arsene Wenger anger at Diego Costa's 'unacceptable behaviour',News,Ripley and Heanor News,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger launched a scathing attack on the dirty tactics of Chelsea striker Diego Costa and labelled referee Mike Dean naive after losing 2-0 at Chelsea, where his side finished with only nine men. 
 
		 
The Gunners saw centre-half Gabriel sent off just before half-time following a series of altercations with  Costa after he had man-handled Laurent Koscielny. 
  Diego Costa, left, and Gabriel confront each other at Stamford Bridge   
Chelsea went on to win at home for the first time in the Barclays Premier League this season as Kurt Zouma headed in a free-kick from one-time Arsenal skipper Cesc Fabregas. 

			 
Any hopes of an Arsenal comeback had ended when Santi Cazorla collected a second yellow card with 11 minutes left before Eden Hazard's late shot ricocheted  off Calum Chambers past Petr Cech, returning to face his old club. 



 
While Wenger accepted Gabriel had been guilty for not controlling himself, flicking out a backheel at Chelsea forward Costa as they returned to the halfway line having both been cautioned, there was no doubt of the main culprit. 

""He can do what he wants, he stays on and everybody else who responds to him has to be sent off. I think it is unacceptable his behaviour,"" said Wenger, who had earlier shaken hands with bitter rival Mourinho ahead of kick-off. 

""If you look well at the pictures what he does to Koscielny before he pushes him down he hits him in the face and the throat, he always gets away with it. 

""It is surprising and I don't understand Mike Dean's decision at all, not on the sending-off - why does Diego Costa stay on the pitch and Gabriel sent off? 

			 
"" Okay I accept he has not to react at all. Gabriel is guilty for getting involved of course, he should not have responded at all, but Koscielny had no choice. 

Wenger added: ""We expect that kind of game and were not surprised, but you expect the referee to make the right decision. 

""I don't deny Gabriel is sent off, he deserves it, but he (Costa) goes down well."" 

Asked if he felt retrospective action from the Football Association was called for, Wenger replied: ""That is the least they could do, but he will do the same again next week and the week after and he always gets away with it. 

			 
""For me, it is always in provocation and he uses well the naivety of Mike Dean today. 

""Look at the pictures, it tells you a lot on slow motion. Before the cross comes in he hits him. 

""The fact is surprising that Diego Costa got away with what he did, that we go into half-time with a red card and he stays on the pitch. 

""They (referees) are professional people, and they have to make the right decision."" 

Unsurprisingly, Mourinho backed Costa, declaring his striker was ""man of the match"". 

			 
The Portuguese coach said: ""Of course not (a red card). The referee was there, it was the same referee that made every decision of the game, was the same referee that didn't give two penalties, clear, for us. It's also the rules of the game. 

""What Gabriel Paulista did to Eden Hazard is something that is allowed in rugby and not in football, and in the box it's a penalty. 

""And in the second half, I don't know which player it was (Bellerin) but he did the same on Diego Costa. In rugby it's fantastic, in football it's a penalty."" 

Mourinho continued: ""If you want to speak about Diego Costa with me, it's just to say he played like he has to play. 

""That is why you have full stadiums, you sell to televisions around the world for millions and millions because the game has to be played like that. Okay? 

""And that's why tomorrow for what I consider comparable in terms of dedication and passion, I go to New Zealand against Argentina (in the Rugby World Cup). I go tomorrow because I love it. Fantastic, Diego."" 

Asked if he was concerned over potential retrospective action, Mourinho said: ""Look, I think he said before the game that I have to cope with my defeats. Tonight he has to cope with his defeat."" 

Chelsea started with captain John Terry on the bench but Mourinho again played down any rift. 

He said: ""John Terry doesn't need me to speak with him because he knows what I feel, what I think. 

""He knows that if I have to choose one out of 25 to be my man he is the first. He knows that I care about him, as a person, as a player. He knows that nothing is at risk. 

""If you want to paint a dark picture, I ask you please don't do it because it's not the reality.  He's in great condition and in a great situation with the manager and with the club."" 

The Football Association is likely to await Dean's match report before deciding whether or not Costa has a case to answer. 

The fact he was booked in the original incident could indicate the referee saw it, but whether he saw it in its entirety could be key. 

Dean's report is likely to be submitted on Monday.
