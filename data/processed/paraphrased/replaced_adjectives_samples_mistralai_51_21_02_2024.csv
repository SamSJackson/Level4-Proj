    Task: Write an essay discussing the argument that first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed. Consider evidence from personal experiences or other evidence that shows this statement is true.","It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions."," Title: The Fallacy of First Impressions: A Change Can Happen

The notion that first impressions are inaccurate and susceptible to change pervades various aspects of modern life. In my experience, a friend judged another acquaintance unfavorably upon their initial meeting, attributing arrogance to the latter's poised demeanor. Yet, over time and numerous encounters, the truth unfolded – the individual exhibited humility, compassion, and depth exceeding any expectations (Lee, 2006). Research indicates that people's first impressions can differ significantly after subsequent interactions. For instance, a scientific journal published by Taylor & Fiske revealed findings of numerous studies demonstrating that both physical appearance ratings and personality assessments change as relationships develop, debunking the belief in the infallibility of first impressions. In conclusion, the complex process of human judgment makes the accuracy of first impressions questionable while emphasizing the importance of ongoing interactions."," Title: The Fallibility of First Impressions: An Enduring Illusion of Reality

Task: Research how important professionalism, effort, and dedication are in succeeding in life. Analyze the stories of Cristiano Ronaldo and yourself to compare. Find other examples and relate them to the importance of mastering skills in life. Evaluate the role of money and success in achieving goals.","Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful.

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow.                                                      "," Professionalism, effort, and dedication play crucial roles in shaping individual success in life. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo's rise to football excellence can attest to this. Started as a humble sports scholar, he practiced diligently, upping his skill level, and maintaining an exemplary work ethic. Yet, the path to success wasn't solely reliant on his abilities. A constant focus on self-improvement propelled him forward in the ultracompetitive football realm, leading to vast success.

    Task: Write an essay exploring the situations where students might not have the time or energy to stay for two extra hours in school and how this can affect them.","Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep."," Title: The Burden of Preferred after Hours: A Students' Dilemma

Task: 

1. Research recent studies/statistics on the effects of a four-day work week for businesses. 
2. Analyze how the implementation of a four-day school week would impact student academic performance and wellbeing.
3. Consider the role of technology in the learning environment of students.
4. Examine the potential outcomes if schools adopt a four-day school week.
5. Compare the pros and cons of a five-day school week","Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. "," title: Redesigning the Educational Calendar: A Four-Day School Week

 recent research on four-day workweek's benefits reveals increased employee morale and productivity, reduced stress, and higher work-life balance (Harvard Business Review, 2021).

Task: Research the common stereotypes associated with various ethnicities and the current state of bias in order to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of making assumptions based on first impressions. Discuss how our perception of people can change when we gain familiarity with a person. Look into how a preconceived notion of an object can sway our opinion of it and how researching the background story can alter our initial reaction.","Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out you'r pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again.

If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.

If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm.

Task: 

Investigate how people in the past have contributed to society by providing a tangible example of their accomplishments and compare them to the current accomplishments. Evaluate how inactivity also affects the way society is and how it would have been different if those in the past were inactive. Discuss what can be done in the present in order to shape a better future for the generations to come.","Many people say how wonderful it is that much can be done if we are always doing something. But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then would've never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we would've never had what we have now.

Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people would've been inactive. Everything that we built and invented would'nt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably would've been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there would'nt be any people working or there would'nt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We would've been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future.

We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose."," title: Innovations Past and Present: A Comparative Study of Societal Impacts and the Consequences of Inactivity

Task: Research the pros and cons of requiring students to take music, drama, art, or other elective classes in order to graduate high school. Compose an essay outlining the benefits and drawbacks of such a policy.","Students chould not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate.

If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world.

Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

2. Compile examples of how knowledge can be more efficient than imagination and vice-versa.
3. Analyze how both imagination and knowledge can be useful when constructing something.
4. Consider the implications of trusting solely on imagination or knowledge.
5. Examine the power and potential of a child's imagination.
6. Investigate the effects of frightening a child's imagination","I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun."," title: Imagination and Knowledge: A Perfect Blend in Innovation by Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein believed both imagination and knowledge are integral to advancement, as they fuel the human ability to innovate [1]. Imagination provides the initial idea [2], while knowledge validates and makes the imagery concrete [3].

Knowledge can sometimes be more efficient than pure imagination when constructing something. For instance, a blueprint, a well-researched plan with information and knowledge, is necessary to manifest physical creations. On the contrary, imagination is essential for problem solving when faced with unprecedented challenges since it can extend beyond existing information and knowledge [4-5].

The risks in solely relying on imagination or knowledge are visible, as an excessive amount of either might obstruct growth: A disproportionate bias for imagination ignores facts, leading to the creation of far-fetched fantasies, whereas complete reliance on knowledge without imagination slows down growth from fresh ideas [5].

A child's imagination is incredibly powerful and has no physical boundaries, inspiring endless possibilities and unbridled curiosity in daydreams, storytelling [6]. Frightening a child's imagination might obstruct creativity: Instead of discouragement, we should provide experiences where their imagination is stimulated to help them explore and understand complex, often abstract concepts [6,7].

```"," Albert Einstein, a pioneering physicist, held imagination and knowledge in equal regard, viewing them as interconnected pillars of discovery. Imagination ignites creativity, allowing us to envision new possibilities (Einstein, 1954). Knowledge, on the other hand, provides a solid foundation, grounding our ideas in reality (Feinberg, 1992).

Imagination can surpass knowledge when exploring uncharted territories, leading to groundbreaking theories. Conversely, knowledge can be more efficient than imagination, as it eliminates incorrect assumptions and narrows down possibilities (Duarte, 2015).

Both are essential when constructing something new. Imagination sparks ideas, while knowledge ensures their feasibility and practical application. However, relying solely on either can result in limitations. A balanced approach grants the most substantial progress.

Children's imaginations hold immense power, shaping their perspectives and influencing their future pursuits. Frightening a child's imagination, though, can hinder their creativity and stifle their intellectual growth (Kolhapur & Kulkarni, 2014). Thus, it is vital to nurture their imagination in a supportive and safe environment.","title: imaginativeness and knowledge: A Perfect portmanteau word in Innovation by Albert Albert Einstein Albert Francis Charles Augustus Emmanuel Albert Einstein believe both imaginativeness and knowledge embody integral to promotion, as they fuel the human ability to introduce[ 1]. imaging provide the initial thought[ 2], while noesis validate and make the imaging concrete[ 3]. knowledge can sometimes equal more efficient than pure vision when construct something.

Task: Research the availability of opportunities to explore occupations in proposed field of study through internships and shadowing opportunities at schools in the local area. Compile the data and create a list of the different companies and organizations that offer these possibilities. Assess the pros and cons of each option and make a conclusion about which one would be the most ideal for someone interested in this field.","Many schools have partnerships with companies that allows students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment.

To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it.

Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didn't continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didn't find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal.

We can't improve our skills until we don't try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we don't we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with

IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. It's all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday.

In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.

Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved."," Title: Revising First Impressions: A Delicate Interplay of Past and Present

To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

You will see your life in a different perspective, than people with negative attitudes. They doubt them selfs threw life and never reach there goal's because they dont have a positive attitude.

Having a positive attitude will also make you a good person. You'll show yourself and others how to change there attitude towards life. As you are accumplishing your own goal's in life, you could be helping others do the same. So by helping people out with the way you see your life, you could help others reach the same goal on positive attitude with there lives. life its self, is the biggest challenge anyone can go threw. Where put threw challenges everyday with out even knowing, and get threw them no matter how hard it may be. By helping others it could make' not just you seced in life but others as well.

Even my family and I have been threw the worse. From living in room's, basement's, and being envicted from apartment's because my parents would'nt make enough money to keep us in one place. They were losing alot of hope with life and from ever being stable for there family, but me as the only boy in the family I had to keep my positive attitude in life for our family goal in reaching stablebility for my older and younger sibling and I. I would wake up on top of some folded blankets the hard wooden floor with my mom and dad aside me but I would'nt care cause as long as I knew my little siblings were on the bed comfortbly sleeping it would make me feel good because I knew one day it was all going to change.

Keeping my positive attitude with my life really helped me alot, because once I turned 16. I started to work at Mcdonald's everday after school from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for five days a week. Everytime I got payed I would save up my checks because I knew my parents never had good cars. We would always buy junky cars off the road, because we could never afford new cars. So I set my self a goal on buying my parents a new car, because I knew it could help them out. By not spending on old cars, I also knew they could never save up from all the stuff they had to pay and such. There were many days at work where I wanted to quit, but I would always look on how my family and I lived. Also on how much my parents struggled just to give us hot food on the table. So I always kept my positive attitude with me for my family.

The day came after 1 year of working I had saved up over 10k for a new car for my parents and the family. My mom and my dad where so proud of me and told me they could never thank me enough for all the hard work I had put in everyday at work for the family. Me and my family started to gain hope on our family after they saw what a big change I had made to the family just by having a positive attitude. So my two oldest sister's and I where starting to save up for a home for the family and that too, we had accomplished. Now we have a home that we have been living in for 5 years now, everyone has there room I bought my self a car too. Life is good and I feel super successful with my life already. So yes, I do believe having a positive attitude is the key to a successful life. "," title: The Power of Positivity: A Pathway to Success

A positive attitude is a vital determinant of achievements in life. Researches indicate that individuals with a positive attitude reap abundant benefits such as better resilience to failures, increased motivation, and more robust problem-solving abilities than their negative counterparts (Groesbeck & Hardy, 2006).

Case in point, Leonardo da Vinci, with a seemingly unquenchable thirst for knowledge, discovered numerous innovative concepts, like helicopters and flying machines – centuries ahead of his era. His sheer persistence in the face of numerous failures underpinned an exponentially increasing success (Lodge, 2005). Conversely, a negative attitude harbors adversity, fueling an array of self-destructive consequences ranging from low productivity, poor physical health, and unhealthy relationships.

The ability to identify, focus on, and adopt strategies and solutions based on optimism despite facing grave adversity is what distinguishes a positive attitude from sheer, uncanny good fortune or the absence of negative circumstances. For instance, J.K Rowling, a struggling, divorced woman with a disabled child and crippling social anxieties, became an archetypal success after she put quill to the page out of sheer boredom when her younger child fell gravely ill, leading to the creation of her worldwide sensation, the Harry Potter series, despite facing innumerable publishing rejects at first, symbolizing the invaluable, indomitable triumph of positivity (Birchinger, 2000)"," Title: The Power of Positivity: A Catalyst for Success

One notable example is J.K. Rowling, who faced numerous rejections in her pursuit of publishing her Harry Potter series. However, undeterred by negative feedback, she remained confident in her work and persisted. Eventually, her positive outlook led to her immense success as a bestselling author.

In contrast, a negative attitude can hinder progress, leading to stagnation and frustration. The mental energy spent on negative thoughts can distract from the tasks essential for achieving goals.

The benefits of a positive attitude extend far beyond individual success. A positive outlook fosters strong relationships, improves overall well-being, and enriches our daily experiences.

Task: 

Research the advantages and disadvantages of enforcing a curfew for teens in cities. Analyze the effects of a curfew on public safety, wellbeing, and productivity. Describe how developing a personal curfew could benefit citizens in the city.","Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe.

City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be.

Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why.

If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story. You can set a curfew for yourself to be safer and more energized for the next day because the early bird gets the worm.

Having a curfew isnt a bad thing. Its an mandatory rule that will helps u live longer, be healthy and keeps u awake for the next day. The earlier you go to bed the more awake you'll feel in the morning since u set a curfew for yourself. I personally set one for myself so I could can be ready to take a test and do my assignments as Im up and at em. The council is a genius for coming up with the idea of a curfew and I am proud to accept and support the idea."," title: A Double-Edged Sword: Teen Curfaws and City Safety

Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they don't do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you don't want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you don't go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing.

Those kind of people don't want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and don't tell any body because you don't know what others want for you. It's better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesn't have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they can't do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you don't do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they don't want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it.

When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they don't care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that don't like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to don't have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you don't want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you don't have those good grades and you just are copying others and when it's test time you don't know what to do because you didn't do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. It's better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they haven't go through things like; one of your friends don't like you and they don't want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and don't tell everyone because you don't know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they don't care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they don't want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you don't stay in front of them as a looser because you didn't they don't know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. That's why people don't trust each others.

It's better to do things that no body know because if you felt or don't get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didn't get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you can't do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice. You want to do things because you want to be proud of yourself and that is the only thing it counts."," Title: Embracing Growth: A Holistic New Year's Resolution Blueprint

Task:

1. Research productive people, such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and discuss how they achieved success.
2. Analyze how getting enough sleep, responsibility, and working hard is vital in achieving success.
3. Explore how inactivity can be detrimental to achieving success.
4. Discuss how even small steps can lead to bigger accomplishments.
5. Compose an essay providing an opinion on how accomplishing more is possible with effort.","We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school wont be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyone's responsible.

There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. as an example I'm going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. no one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it weren't for them, no one would have these useful items: IPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard.

Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that they're not pushing themselves is because they don't have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive.

In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. you cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplismnet. If you want to be sucessful, you always have to do something, Even though it's little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes.

Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying.

When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day.

Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much you'll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything you've been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because I've been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home I'd play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life.

Some people don't like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts.

In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that you'll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``"," I am most passionate about painting and see it as a transformative outlet that expresses emotions and creativity.

Task: Research the pros and cons of requiring an arts class or making it an elective for students. Evaluate which option would be better for graduating and for society. Argument for an opinion on whether students should be required to take an arts class or make it an elective.","A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective.

There are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful.

Students should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didn't like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they don't participate,or turn in assignments. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected.

In addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate.

As you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy.

Task: Evaluate the role of failure in people's lives in order to achieve success. Consider how failure can be beneficial in showing maturity and helping with enthusiasm. Provide examples to support your argument.","The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although many people believes that Churchill's statement is wrong, I believe in the important role that failure plays in people's lives to be successful in the future. In fact of the society, failure is a bad experience, however, I believe that failure is a way to help people to grow in personally, to be more successfully, and teaches you how to be mannerly.

Every single day, we are exposed to a reality that can be favorable or unfortunate. Where people need to learned about their failures, and grow personally from their new experiences. They made you more mature. That can be the example of my aunt, a nice woman who had an accident in the past. She was traumatized after that accident, but that never stop her to receive professional help with enthusiasm and do what she likes to do, helps others. My aunt understood that everything is possible if we do not loss our enthusiasm, and our pleasure to be success.

Life treat of deal with all unexpected situations. Failures that people never thought that could happen to them. However, everything depends on your enthusiasm, if you want to stay in the same place or learned about your failure and keep going until you accomplish your dreams. Generic_Name, a friend, is an example of the statement just mentioned. Generic_Name wanted to pass his classes in order to graduate. Generic_Name's teachers always told him that he was wasting his time if he was planning to go to the university, but Generic_Name never loss his hopes. Generic_Name became more expert in every subject, he graduated. Moreover, he demonstrated that everybody could be successful, if they try their best.

Everything has two faces, like a coin. As failures can be bad experiences, they can also be helpful if we look at them with good eyes, and if we receive them with good manners. People need to realize that the way in which a thing is happening is not bad at all. Things happens to foment our self and made us more mature. An example of this can be all of us.

Task: Analyze why it is important to be aware of your actions when it comes to items found on the ground. Create an argument or opinion on why people should not take something that is not theirs.","Have you ever found something on the ground and picked it up and pretended that is was yours.

That right there is called a lie and its really bad because you dont know if that money you found or that toy you found was somebod's when they come back to look for it its gone because somebody else just walked away with there stuff that they spent there money on. When I was a kid I would always see this stuff, people would drop there stuff and I would pick it up and give it back to them or tell them they dropped it and hand it over to them. Usually when people find stuff just laying around the first thing to come to mind is take it but that isnt very smart because you never know whos it is or where it came from, and taking if its not your is stealing. Many people say leave it where you found it because people will comeback looking for there stuff, because nobody leaves there stuff somewhere and then just walks away with out knowing or caring. I know many schools teach this because when I was at my elementary school there would always be signs all over the place talking about leave it where you found it and dont take whats not yours, many kids listened to that in my school but sometimes people just dont care and thats not okay because they might not even need it and just want it. Needing it is like you have to have something or its really important to you and if you dont have it you would have to struggle to find, but if you really need something then I am pretty sure you can buy it from any nearby stores. Wanting something is like you dont have to have it but you just want it to brag or to have fun with it or you just dont really care and dont need it but just want to take something that you can buy, even though your not struggling or going through any trouble you just felt like doing the action you did and dont really care.

If you find something dont take it

If you see somebody drop something give it back to them

Be aware of your actions

Dont listen to pear pressure

Be helpful

Be kind

This lesson is very important because many people now dont do this stuff and just take and many parent dont really care anymore so thats when the school has to step in and teach the young kids whats wrong and whats right. When somebody drops something always hand it back why you say, because if you drop something and you think you lost it and it was your favorite toy or a toy that you spent your money on and really liked it, what if somebody just saw it and took it how would you feel, probably mad, sad,upset, you would be very upset because your favorite toy is gone and you cant get it back because the person that took it does not really care and didnt need it but just wanted it or took it because there was nobody there. Now imagine you drop your favorite toy and somebody saw you drop it and ran up to you to give it back to you how would you feel, probably happy, proud, delighted, because that person gave it back and didnt have any intentions with it or didnt think about even taking it they just wanted to give it back because they are not the owners of the item that was found on the ground but the owner that dropped it is right in front of them, the owner of the item could of just walked away and never realized they dropped it until they needed to use it for something. I lost my iPad years ago because the person that saw it took it and didnt really care do I know who it is no because I never payed attention to who took it I just was really happy and didnt realize what they were gonna do, and didnt think of this stuff happening to me when it did happen I was very upset and had to use my moms phone until my dad would buy me a phone. Thats why this lesson is very important to show kids that taking something that isnt yours is not smart or needed, many people dont care but when it happens to them they care and ask there self why did this happen to me is because you didnt leave what you took where it was found so the person that saw the item you own they did the same thing you just did, they took it and you will probably never see it again. Many items are very expensive like phones people love there phones and can never get off it and when somebody cracks there phone they go nuts and get mad because that crack can make your phone glitch or tweak, but if somebody lost there phone I already know that they would be so mad because nowadays phones are over $1,000 and they can be more expensive then that so when they lose there phone and find out somebody took it they wouldnt be very happy and probably go every where to look for it and would do anything to get it back, because phones are so important to people and sometimes they need it for calling somebody to pick them up or they would be stuck at a place for a long time or to call for help if somebody needs it. If somebody stole my phone I would get very angry and sad because the item I just lost and somebody picked it up or stole it is very expensive and isnt easy to buy because new phones are like the cost of a used car that you can buy from the internet."," title: mindful discovery: theethics andimportance of respectingfinds

Task: Write an essay about the importance of challenging yourself and practical examples on how it is useful.","Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered,

You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation

Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car,

Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back.

Task: Research and compare the benefits of distance learning for students versus traditional classroom learning. Discuss how different students may benefit from one or the other.","Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference.

Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it.

Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you.

Task: Write an essay exploring why it is important for high school students to start thinking about their future career.","Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school."," title: Preparing for the Future: The Importance of Career Planning for High School Students

Use this data to propose a",Some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. If they don't know how to somethings in school or out side of school. Or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. For older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. And can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. Challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. School program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. Might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. And have good jobs later in there lives and I think that more kids should have this. Chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. Because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they can't that why there are the older student. That can them help he or she with the home work or projects.

Analyse the implications of people not being accepted for who they truly are, with regard to interpersonal relations and professional success. Consider evidence from your own experience, and the views expressed by Ralph Waldo Emerson.","I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because people in this world want you to be another person that yourself. I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often."," Title: The Hollow Mask: Consequences of Unacceptance in Personal Relations and Professional Success
