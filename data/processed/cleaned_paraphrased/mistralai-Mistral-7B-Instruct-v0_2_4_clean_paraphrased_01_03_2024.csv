Task: Write an essay discussing how technology has had a negative impact on people's lives and has caused people to lose the ability to think for themselves.","Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. "," Title: The Perils of Technology: A Threat to Self-Thinking

The advent of technology has significantly altered the human landscape, bringing about unprecedented conveniences.However, the excessive reliance on technology may pose detrimental risks. One major concern is the gradual erosion of self-thinking abilities. Technologically advanced tools such as search engines, artificial intelligence, and predefined algorithms have made it convenient for many individuals to seek ""answers"" rather than think independently and solve complex problems. While technology might simplify tasks, over-reliance on it could stem mental agility, impair creativity, and weaken problem-solving abilities. Encouraging healthy and balanced use is essential as technology alone cannot cater to the complex aspects of human growth that require self-reliance, ingenuity, and original thought."," Title: Technology's Negative Impact: The Loss of Independent Thinking

Technology, once regarded as a tool to enhance productivity, has evolved into a double-edged sword. Its pervasive use has led to a rise in information availability but at the cost of independent thinking. People increasingly rely on search engines for answers, rather than using their cognitive abilities to reason and problem-solve. Moreover, technological distractions, such as social media, often hinder deep concentration, further diminishing the capacity for independent thought. As we become overly dependent on technology, we risk losing the valuable skill of critical thinking. It is essential to strike a balance between leveraging technology and preserving our ability to think independently.","The advent of technology has significantly altered the human world, bringing unprecedented conveniences. However, the excessive reliance on technology has its pitfalls. One of these pitfalls is the gradual deterioration of the mind. The development of technology has greatly altered the way people think.

Task: Analyze the pros and cons of having a 4-day school week with ten hours of school each day.","Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? on my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home.

Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students,specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college. on my opinion the best thing to do is to keep the regular five days at school, and to keep working at least six hours a day.

Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home and they will do their homework or study, but what they dont think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a students used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from it

People wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they dont think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day.

For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school everyday, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students dont understand that and they will not do it at home."," title: A Four-Day School Week With Longer Hours: A Double-Edged Sword

A four-day school week with ten hours each day presents an engaging dilemma of effective learning versus work-life balance. Its benefits lie in reduced commuting time and increased focus per day, enabling teachers and students to delve deeper into subjects (prod: depth of learning). On the contrary, a long day may result in fatigue and adversely affect student's focus and motivation. Additionally, working parents' struggle to juggle their personal, employment and home duties might escalate, creating unnecessary stress.

On the positive side, students would have three additional days for self-directed learning, leading to improved time management and deepened understanding of subjects. Teachers could have extra preparation time and potentially earn more, as their workload remains the same.

However, the cons include increased costs for families who require childcare for an extra day, as well as added pressure for students to perform optimally during longer school hours. Moreover, possible loss of extracurricular opportunities and reduced opportunities for social and emotional growth are negative implications.

Task: Analyze and explore the benefits of implementing a curfew for teenagers.","Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger.

They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules.
