MENLO PARK, Calif., Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- At a time when cybersecurity breaches are becoming more frequent and significant, organizations are continuing to place a high priority on improving their cybersecurity frameworks. However, despite improvement in many areas, one in three companies still lacks policies for its information security, data encryption and data classification, according to The Battle Continues - Working to Bridge the Data Security Chasm: Assessing the Results of Protiviti 2015 IT Security and Privacy Survey (www.protiviti.com/ITsecuritysurvey) from global consulting firm Protiviti.

""It's no stretch to state that the spectrum and sophistication of cyberattacks and the diversification of their origin will continue to increase,"" said Cal Slemp, a Protiviti managing director with the firm's global cybersecurity practice. ""Companies appear intent on addressing data security issues, but are these intentions translating into effective policies and actions to secure organizations' most valuable data? The results are mixed, at best, according to our 2015 survey. It's increasingly important for organizations to avoid complacency and consistently enhance their infrastructure, data frameworks and response plans to protect, mitigate and manage potential breaches.""

The IT security and privacy survey, which gathered insights from 708 Chief Information Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Technology Officers, IT vice presidents and directors and other IT management professionals, assesses security and privacy policies, data governance, data retention and storage, data destruction policies, and third-party vendors and access, among other topics that organizations need to manage and improve. Protiviti's report also includes recommended actions for IT leaders as well as trends to watch. Key findings from the 2015 survey include:

I’ve known it all along–but I failed to accept it as truth– Pushing on through may result in temporary success, but inevitably it makes things a whole lot worse. However, not one to be defeated, I have also accepted that a few adjustments may be necessary at times to achieve my goals. If you had spoken to me at the beginning of the year and told me I would need to rely on a wheelchair a couple of times I would have told you that you were crazy. No. Way. I was capable and I was managing. I was walking miles each day. I was doing it. The truth? My body was doing amazing things for me. Amazing things that it simply could not sustain. Eventually it would break down and say “no more.” The first time I used an electric scooter I was mortified. I was in California, at Disneyland, and even though I felt like hell I was determined I was going to do it all and enjoy it. By 11 a.m., a measly two hours in, I was dead on my feet and struggling to even walk. My husband, bless him, talked me round into hiring a scooter. We had only one day to enjoy both theme parks and the options were (1) go home or (2) hire a scooter. Like I said, I was mortified. That’s the plain truth. I didn’t feel like I justified the use of one. I mean, I am in my twenties and I. Don’t. Look. Sick. Surely they would think I was a fraud! And what would people think when they saw me? Well I’ll tell you something. As soon as I sat in that scooter all those worries dissipated. I had this huge smile on my face and I couldn’t stop giggling. It was simply the best decision I made that day. It was like a weight has been lifted and I instantly felt better and I had an amazing time. The staff at Disney are wonderful and, as for other people, I simply couldn’t care less. Yes people looked. I’m sure many thought, “I wonder what’s wrong with her?” or “she doesn’t look sick.” But you know what? I was oblivious the majority of the time. I was too busy enjoying myself. And any time I did notice I started singing “Ridin’” to my husband and we would be in stitches. “They see me rollin’, they hatin’, patrollin’, they tryin’ to catch me ridin’ dirty.” I have no prejudice against wheelchairs at all. I just did not see myself being in one. Since that day at Disney though, my whole perspective has shifted. You just have to adapt and do anything that will help you achieve what you want to do. I am capable of walking a lot on some days. On others I simply haven’t been capable. It’s just the nature of the illness. It doesn’t make me a fraud. My friends are amazing and were so supportive and totally understood the need for the chair. My husband wheeled me round the Enchanted Forest, another park, and I had my tripod and camera to take some photos without even leaving the chair. Without it, I simply would not have managed and would have been sat at home upset and frustrated at missing out. It was the start of me getting out and about again and then slowly getting back on my feet. I’ve come to accept that I need help and assistance at times. It might seem embarrassing at first but . . . please–embrace anything that will help you to get out and do the things you want to do. My life with fibromyalgia is a bit of a roller coaster. There’s some ups, some downs and some unexpected turns. Embrace the ride and do all you can to enjoy it. Donna lives in Scotland with her husband, Ross, and their dog, Oscar. She loves photography, writing, traveling–pretty much anything creative and the NFL.

In June, the developers of a proposed wind power project in Swanton gave formal notification of their plan to construct up to seven wind turbines. That plan has sparked protest by those opposed to the development. “It’s irresponsible for me not to do something like this,” said Travis Belisle, the developer who says he’s trying to cut down on fossil fuel dependence with his Swanton Wind project. The plan is to build seven wind turbines, up to 499 feet tall along a ridge line not far from Vermont Route 105. It’s also not far from a number of homes. “It’s our communities. All the villages in Vermont need to be on the same page, and I don’t think everybody’s getting that opportunity,” said Paula Pearsall who lives nearby. Protesters rallied outside Thursday night’s informational meeting, where the community got to speak with environmental, real estate, and sound experts commissioned by Swanton Wind LLC. It was a chance to learn more about the project that could start construction as soon as 2016. A frequent worry heard from residents is the impact construction will have on the water and wildlife. ”We live right on Fairfield Pond. How can this be good if it’s going to come downhill to the lake?” said Pearsall. “We will be meeting all the state regulations that are related to water quality for projects of this type and any type,” said Scott Homsted, a civil engineer working with the project. Along with water quality and land preservation, noise pollution is another concern for people living near the proposed wind farm. “This project proposes to put seven 500-foot towers 1,800 or 2,000 feet from Vermont families. I don’t support that,” said former Vermont Lt. Governor Brian Dubie, who lives near the project. This wouldn’t be the first wind turbine project in Vermont. One not too far away started running in Georgia in 2012. The Swanton turbines could not only be potentially 70 feet taller than those in Georgia, but also closer to homes. Danielle Garrant says she and her kids live less than half a mile away. So does Belisle. “It’s very scary to think of the possible impact that this is going to have on them,” said Garrant speaking of her young children. Belisle says when it comes to some of the concern people have expressed about the turbines, he gets it. ”As far as visual impacts, you know, they are what they are. That is the current technology we have to work with today we can’t get to the next level of technology without investing in what’s current,” said Belisle. Some residents think more time needs to be spent weighing the pros and cons. “Why don’t we take a step back and find out for sure. I’ll be open to that,” said Pearsall. The earliest the Belisle could submit an application for the project is Oct. 8. The plans are subject to review by Vermont’s Public Service Board. Correction: a previous edit said the Swanton turbines could be twice as tall as the Georgia turbines. They could be 70 feet taller.

 So let's take this one at face value here… It was Pride time for gay men everywhere! And just as important is seeing queer comedians again because it proves once more when you put their faces together there are no less than 28 straight actors coming out every year with little effort on our side either (that all counts – especially if they have other interests). Why go round proclaiming your love towards others? This episode focuses on why some big names made good money doing things around them instead [3]. So fuck off lesbian guys who haven't got anything better going :) You see what meh about 'gay porn stars?' That thing where each person thinks these dudes will make fun or sexy comments until someone gives him credit but takes pride not saying anyone else did something without even realizing otherwise which might be considered offensive behavior so can always ask his shit friend("," ratings are stable now because it was not reshuffled from its 2009 debut,"" NBC News recently reported.""In 2013 alone TWC completed more than 60 episodes showing African American lesbian couples dating each other despite efforts between networks such as Comedy Central Productions (now Warner Brothers) to turn those'reimagining.'

It'll seem shocking now then if something really happened during an episode such Asami did show off her bisexualness due toward queer fans after seeing some great pictures with them – because maybe you have actually watched gay men get flack from other same‐sex folks… Anyway all we can say
Possibly I know 'cause she never seemed particularly impressed.. Still…..it looks very clear why Pernix needs diversity….but wait he got away!! And what kind doesn't? Because fuck Hairy Titty Suckers!!!"

Day will go to sleep knowing that when he takes to the course the next morning, a neat wedge shot could align him with the select few to have shot 59. 

Six men have achieved the feat on the PGA Tour, including David Duval, Stuart Appleby and Jim Furyk. Annika Sorenstam in 2001 became the only woman to have achieved the mark, at an LPGA tournament in Arizona. Ryo Ishikawa once hit a 58 on the Japan Golf Tour.

Day admitted afterwards - with a four shot lead over second-placed Daniel Berger - that he didn't even realise he was closing in on the mark until told by world No.2 Jordan Spieth, who scored a highlight of his own with a hole in one. 

""To be honest, I thought it was par-72, so I'm sitting there going, 10-under, there's no chance at all I can get it,"" Day said.

303def8c-3d09-421e-bb89-288f680521a2,"Arsenic Found in Many U.S. Red Wines, but Health Risks Depend on Total Diet",News,HealthNewsDigest.com,"(HealthNewsDigest.com) - Newswise - A new University of Washington study that tested 65 wines from America's top four wine-producing states - California, Washington, New York and Oregon - found all but one have arsenic levels that exceed what's allowed in drinking water.  
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allows drinking water to contain no more than 10 parts per billion of arsenic. The wine samples ranged from 10 to 76 parts per billion, with an average of 24 parts per billion. 
 
But a companion study concluded that the likely health risks from that naturally-occurring toxic element depend on how many other foods and beverages known to be high in arsenic, such as apple juice, rice, or cereal bars, an individual person eats. The highest risks from arsenic exposure stem from certain types of infant formulas, the study estimated. 
 
The two studies from UW electrical engineering professor Denise Wilson appear on the cover of the October 2015 issue of the Journal of Environmental Health. 
 
""Unless you are a heavy drinker consuming wine with really high concentrations of arsenic, of which there are only a few, there's little health threat if that's the only source of arsenic in your diet,"" said Wilson. 
 
""But consumers need to look at their diets as a whole. If you are eating a lot of contaminated rice, organic brown rice syrup, seafood, wine, apple juice - all those heavy contributors to arsenic poisoning - you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids and the elderly."" 
 
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is toxic to humans in some forms, and can cause skin, lung and bladder cancers, and other diseases. As rain, rivers or wind erode rocks that contain arsenic, it leaches into water and soil. From there, the toxic metalloid can work its way into the food chain. 
 
The UW study is the first peer-reviewed research in decades to look at the arsenic content of American wines. As a group, they had higher arsenic levels than their European counterparts, likely due to the underlying geology of U.S. wine growing regions. 
 
The study looked at red wines, except from two areas in Washington where only white wines were produced, because they are made with the skin of grapes where arsenic that is absorbed from soil tends to concentrate. 
 
Wilson also tested for lead, which is a common co-contaminant. The study found lead in 58 percent of the samples, but only 5 percent - all from New York - exceeded drinking water standards. 
 
Washington wines had the highest arsenic concentrations, averaging 28 parts per billion, while Oregon's had the lowest, averaging 13 parts per billion.  
""There were no statistical differences among Washington, New York and California,"" she said. ""The only star in the story is Oregon, where arsenic concentrations were particularly low."" 
 
Where possible, the study also compared wines grown in ""new"" vineyards and those that had been converted from other agricultural uses like orchards, where farmers likely used arsenic-based pesticides that were popular in the early 20th century. It found some evidence that higher levels of arsenic in Washington red wines could be a result of pesticide residue. 
 
Because the average adult drinks far more water (between 1.7 and 3.2 cups per day) than even core or frequent wine drinkers (roughly a half cup per day on average), it's an imperfect comparison to gauge health risks based on the EPA drinking water standard of 10 parts per billion. That's why Wilson also evaluated how much arsenic individuals can safely consume from all the sources in their diet. 
 
In a companion study, she compiled consumption data for foods that have been shown to contain arsenic - juice, milk, bottled water, wine, cereal bars, infant formula, rice, salmon and tuna. 
 
From that, she was able to determine how much of an arsenic ""dose"" an average child or adult would get from each food source and how close it would come to risk thresholds set by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry for total arsenic consumption across a person's diet. 
 
For the core or frequent adult wine drinker, the arsenic consumed from that single source would only make up 10 to 12 percent of the total maximum recommended daily arsenic intake. But if that person also eats large quantities of contaminated rice, tuna or energy bars, for instance, that could push that individual's arsenic consumption beyond levels that are considered safe. 

A person who eats an average or large amount of contaminated rice would get between 41 and 101 percent of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that one source alone, the study found. A child who drinks apple juice could get a quarter of the maximum daily arsenic dose from that single source. 

The food that posed the largest risk of arsenic poisoning was infant formula made with organic brown rice syrup, an alternative to high-fructose corn syrup. Wilson estimated that some infants eating large amounts of certain formulas may be getting more than 10 times the daily maximum dose of arsenic. 

Based on recent studies that have found arsenic in numerous foods and beverages, Wilson recommends that U.S. wineries test for arsenic and lead in irrigation and processing water and take steps to remove those contaminants if levels are found to be high. 

But rather than litigate against vineyards - as some have done - she would encourage consumers to evaluate their diets more holistically and speak with a doctor if they have concerns. Tests are available that can detect high arsenic levels and tend to capture arsenic exposure over longer histories than other toxic chemicals. 

""The whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard,"" Wilson said. ""My goal is to get people away from asking the question ‘who do we blame?' and instead offer consumers a better understanding of what they're ingesting and how they can minimize health risks that emerge from their diets.""

About Strongbridge Biopharma 
 
Following the successful completion of its exchange offer to acquire the 
      issued ordinary shares of Cortendo AB, Strongbridge Biopharma is now the 
      new parent company of the Cortendo group. The groups strategic focus is 
      to build a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, 
      in-licensing, acquisition and eventual commercialization of 
      complementary product candidates across multiple franchises that target 
      rare diseases. The groups lead product candidate, COR-003 
      (levoketoconazole), is a cortisol inhibitor that is currently being 
      studied in the global Phase 3 trial for the treatment of endogenous 
      Cushings syndrome. COR- 003 has received orphan designation from both 
      the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
      The group recently expanded its rare endocrine disease franchise with 
      the completion of transactions for two Phase 2 product candidates: 
      COR-004, a novel second-generation antisense compound, which is in 
      clinical development for acromegaly and designed to block the synthesis 
      of growth hormone receptor (GHr) thereby reducing levels of insulin-like 
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the blood; and COR-005, a next-generation 
      somatostatin analog (SSA) with a unique receptor affinity profile, being 
      investigated for the treatment of acromegaly, with potential additional 
      applications in Cushings disease and neuroendocrine tumors. The group's 
      intent is to independently commercialize its rare endocrine assets in 
      key global markets.

In an interview with Russian media, he blamed Western support for what he called ‘terrorists’ for the exodus from Syria amid his country’s civil war. And he accused Europe of inconsistency. 
 
“How can you feel sad at a child’s death in the sea and not feel for the thousands of children who have been killed by the terrorists in Syria? 
And also for the elderly, for the woman and men? These European double standards are no longer acceptable,” Assad said. 
 
More than 240,000 people have died in four years of conflict between insurgents and Syria’s government which describes all armed groups fighting it as terrorists. The insurgents in Syria range from the hardline group calling itself Islamic State to nationalists viewed as moderate by the West. 
 
“The West is supporting terrorists since the beginning of this crisis when it said it was ‘a peaceful uprising’ – as they called it . 
 
“They said later, it is moderate opposition and now they say these (are) terrorists like al-Nusra and ISIS , but because of the Syrian state, or Syrian regime, or the Syrian president.” 
 
Countries including the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia want to see Assad leave power and have supported opposition to his rule, including some of the armed groups fighting him. 
 
Assad said Turkish support had been crucial to the growth of two of the biggest insurgent groups in Syria, ISIS and the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that aerial bombing by a US-led coalition has failed to stop ISIS . Turkey denies the accusation. 
 
Assad has been buoyed in recent weeks by signs of increased military support from his ally Russia.

In an attempt to raise national awareness of pediatric cancer, one Boston-based mother has shared a touching tribute video on  Facebook  that provides a brief glimpse into the life of her son Mason, who died last year of pediatric cancer. 

Mason Nicholas Silva was diagnosed at just five and a half months old, and passed away on April 28th, 2014 just a few weeks after his first birthday, after succumbing to myelodysplastic syndrome -which is part of a group of disorders related to abnormal blood cells in the bone marrow  -  and leukemia. 

Despite her grief, his mother Alissa Silva, 35, was determined to spread the word about September being National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month - and now her powerful video, which shows her revealing a series of notecards set to Rachel Platten's Fight Song - has been viewed more than 39 million times. 
   
Little angel: Alissa Silva's one-year-old son Mason passed away last year following a battle with childhood leukemia  
  
Viral video: Mrs Silva holds up a series of cards throughout the video which tell the story of her son Mason's (right) battle with cancer 

'Hi, my name is Alissa and I am the mother of two children,' reads the first card that Mrs Silva holds up. She then introduces Mason, holding up an image of a smiling tot, before revealing that Mason has a younger sister, Alexis Mayse. 

She then holds up another card which reads: 'I will never have a picture of them together because they've never met... Because Mason lives in heaven now along with half of my heart.' 

Fighting back visible emotion, she reveals that Mason was diagnosed with cancer at just five and a half months and 'fought hard' for seven more months.  

Tragically, he then relapsed on the night of his first birthday and died in his mother's arms 23 days later. 

The heartbreaking clip continues to explain Mason's disease along with some shocking facts surrounding childhood cancer. 
   
Surprise: The video sees Mrs Silva urging other parents to learn more about pediatric cancer, explaining on one of her cards that the disease 'spares no ethnic group, socioeconomic class or geographic region' 
   
Smiling sister: In her video, Mrs Silva explains that she welcomed a little girl, Alexis, earlier this year 
   
Proud parents: Mrs Silva's heartbreaking videos have been viewed more than 39 million times on her Facebook page Baby Mason Updates  

On another card, Mrs Silva explains that AML (Acute Myeloid) Leukemia is 'not that rare', and adds that 'every school day 46 children are diagnosed, and one in 330 children will have the disease by age 20'. 

Yet, Mrs Silva claims on another card, of the total federal funding for cancer research,  'only four per cent of federal government funding goes to our kids'. 

According to the American Cancer Society , leukemia is the most common cancer in children in teens, accounting for nearly one in every three cases.   

The mother later introduces people to childhood cancer charity St. Baldrick's Foundation, which funds cancer research. Though the video is incredibly emotional, it leaves us on a hopeful note. 

'I promised Mason that I would bring as much awareness to this as I could,' Silva's notecard reads, before calling on people to take action.   
   
Brave battle: Mason was diagnosed with ALS leukemia at five and a half months, and passed away seven months later 
  
Loving care: Mrs Silva says that she is sad Mason has never met his sister Alexis Mayse because he is in heaven  
   
Doting dad: In one clip posted to the couple's Facebook page, Mason's father Kevin can be seen decorating the nursery to prepare for his birth  

'This is ""My Fight Song"" and I will continue to fight until our kids get the funding they deserve.'  

And this is not the only fight that Mrs Silva has had to face. 

On a fundraising page set up when Mason was battling the disease, it is revealed that the mother-of-two 'fell from a loft' and broke her spine, which left her paralyzed from the waist down.  

But still she refused to let it stop her, the website explains: 'Alissa adapted to her life changes and lived her life. She found Kevin and she became Alissa Collins Silva, a beautiful bride.  

'Alissa thought her life was complete. That is until her baby boy Mason was born. 

Mrs Silva's latest video joins several others that document baby Mason's journey on the Baby Mason Updates Facebook page, which his mother Alissa, and her husband Kevin, set up while he was battling cancer.  

Through the page, Mrs Silva has shared images and videos of her baby bump, footage of Mason's tiny baby shoes and a shot of his father painting the nursery blue in preparation for Mason's arrival into the world.  
   
 Touching tribute: Mrs Silva and her husband have shared many of Mason's most adorable moments online 
   
Telling the story: Mrs Silva, who is paralyzed from the waist down, was overjoyed when Mason was born, and spent months documenting his short, but wonderful, life online  

'We can't wait to meet you; we're so excited to see your little face,' she says in the clip. Shortly after the birth, she cradles her newborn son, telling him 'You are perfect.'  

'It was all worth it. Everything that I went through. You will have a good life with us,' she says, before adding 'This is the best day of my life.'  

Mason is shown at one week old, then pictures flash forward documenting the first year of his life, from dressing up as a pumpkin for Halloween to sleeping in his crib and singing the Number Four song from Sesame Street - and later, after he began receiving treatment for his illness.  

Many grieving parents have reached out to the Silva family in comments, revealing that they have also lost children to the deadly disease.

d40fee81-f5c9-44a1-a109-c3ee0da31514,It's important to get Net neutrality debate right in India: Facebook,News,Economic Times,"NEW YORK: Social media giant Facebook has said it's important to get the debate on Net neutrality ""right"" in India as the country is home to the world's largest population of the ""unconnected"". 

The US-based company faced severe criticism over alleged violation of Net neutrality by Internet.org even as Facebook has continued to defend the initiative that offers free access to basic Internet services to consumers. 

India has over 8 lakh users under the Internet.org initiative. 

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said the regulatory framework needs to protect Net neutrality for consumers and also ensure that companies are allowed to work on new models for stepping up Internet access. 

""There is this big struggle, debate in India now on how you balance these two things and this is an incredibly important debate because India is the country in the world with the most unconnected people,"" he said. 

He added that connecting everyone to the Internet is a large national and global priority as it will help with job creation and elevating people from poverty. 

""I think we need to make sure the regulatory framework that enables both of those things -- Net neutrality protection that folks need and the ability to work on new models for (Internet) access,"" he said. 

As part of its Internet.org initiative, Facebook had partnered with telecom major Reliance Communications in India to offer free access to over 30 websites without data charges to users. 

Internet.org, which has recently been rebranded as Free Basics, is now available in 20 countries. 

The firm faced massive criticism for the platform as it was seen violating the principle of Net neutrality, which is against any priority being accorded to an entity in the Internet traffic flow on account of payments to service providers like telecom companies. 

""Let's say, we roll out Free Basics everywhere in the world and are successful. But if something goes wrong in India and we don't get the debate right and the balance isn't struck correctly, that will hold the whole world back from helping grow their economy, from all the ideas that people who don't have Internet yet,"" Zuckerberg said. 

The young billionaire said the company believes in Net neutrality ""very strongly"". 

Citing an example, he said it is not fair if an operator charges extra for some services. 

""But at the same time, if you have a student in a classroom looking up information for free to do her homework, it is hard to see why there is an issue for that,"" he said. 

Zuckerberg had, in the past too, come out in defence of the programme, saying that it did not block or throttle services and is not in conflict with Net neutrality. 

Facebook Vice-President of Communications and Public Policy, Elliot Schrage said the company has made the changes in response to the discussion that has happened in India and throughout the world. 

""We changed the name of the service to make sure there was no confusion that this is a set of free basic services and not the whole Internet,"" he said. 

Schrage added that the platform is open to all developers and operators. 

""We are a company which goes, tests, learns and then takes feedback from the entire community and our goal here is to grow the whole Internet,"" he said.",550,"NEW YORK: Social media giant Facebook has said it's important to get the debate on Net neutrality ""right"" in India as the country is home to the world's largest population of the ""unconnected"".

2f130004-345c-49ea-9bc7-c1d2e143b873,Why Reading Is One Of The Healthiest Things You Can Do For Yourself,Blog,HealthFreedoms,"People are more health conscious these days than they have ever been. It seems everywhere you look there is some miracle treatment for anything that might ail you in life. In reality, one of the best things you can do to boost your health is simply reading a book. 
 
In 2009, Mindlab International, a consultancy based at the University of Sussex, determined that reading was the most effective form of stress relief when compared to typical stress relief methods. The study was done by putting participants through a range of tests and exercises to increase stress levels and heart rate. Then the participants engaged in typical stress relief activities like listening to music, walking, playing video games, and reading. 
 
The results showed that reading for just 6 minutes reduced stress levels by an average of 68%. In fact, in most cases, stress levels were lower than what they were before the test began. By comparison, listening to music reduced stress levels by 61% taking a walk reduced stress by 42%, and playing video games reduced stress by 21%. 
 
Dr. David Lewis, who conducted the study, concluded: “Losing yourself in a book is the ultimate relaxation. This is particularly poignant in uncertain economic times when we are all craving a certain amount of escapism.It really doesn’t matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a while exploring the domain of the author’s imagination.This is more than merely a distraction, but an active engaging of the imagination as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness.” 
 
One major thing to keep in mind when it comes to reading is not just THAT you read, but HOW you read. Research has shown that reading a tablet before bed can actually lead to an increase in the symptoms of insomnia. Reading an actual, printed, physical book is the key. A recent study in Norway showed that people who read on a Kindle were significantly worse at remembering what they read over people who read printed text. Anne Mangen of Stavanger University, concluded that “the haptic and tactile feedback of a Kindle does not provide the same support for mental reconstruction of a story as a print pocket book does.” 
 
Mangen thinks that the difference for Kindle readers “might have something to do with the fact that the fixity of a text on paper, and this very gradual unfolding of paper as you progress through a story is some kind of sensory offload, supporting the visual sense of progress when you’re reading.” Her theory is based on the fact that our brains weren’t really designed for reading, but have adapted to understand letters and text.

f64a51cc-a283-4c6b-a396-3c94e65ed431,IMF official warms to interim deal to boost emerging markets role,News,AlertNet,"(Adds comments from IMF executive, background, comment from Brazil, academic)

By Marc Jones and Krista Hughes

LONDON/WASHINGTON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - A compromise deal on reforms to give emerging markets greater influence at the International Monetary Fund is increasingly likely, a key official said on Friday, weeks before a deadline for U.S. action expires.

Plans agreed in 2010 to give emerging markets more IMF voting power and double the Fund's resources have been delayed by the fact the U.S. Congress has not approved the change.

If Congress does not pass reforms by Sept. 15, the IMF board has said it will discuss an ""interim solution"" by month's end. Options include increasing the quota for key emerging economies without requiring any change in the U.S. position.

Rakesh Mohan, the IMF's executive director for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Sri Lanka, told Reuters: ""There's more and more likelihood that something like that will happen.""

""We could do some ad-hoc changes like we did in 2008. You could increase the shares of some countries that are most under-represented, China, India, etc.""

The comments suggest that opposition among emerging markets to any halfway measures may be abating.

""This is a signal to the administration and to Congress that the world is ready to proceed without them,"" Peterson Institute for International Economics senior fellow Jacob Funk Kirkegaard said.

But Brazil's representative on the executive board, Otaviano Canuto, said his country had not yet abandoned hope of a full-fledged reform, although he said the discussion would ""probably"" head towards an ad hoc change as an interim step.

""We have not given up yet,"" he said in an interview in his office in Washington, noting that the final deadline for Congress to act was the end of 2015.

""Pushing for any alternative ... would be tantamount to throwing in the towel with respect to the 2010 reform.""

So-called ad hoc changes would probably result in the U.S quota share falling from its current 17.7 percent, although remaining above the 15 percent threshold that gives the country a veto on key IMF decisions.

But it would fall short of the change in governance and funding originally envisaged. Any ad hoc reform would also require the support of the United States.

Each member country of the IMF is assigned a quota based on its relative position in the world economy. This determines its maximum financial commitment to the IMF and its voting power.

Brazil's previous IMF executive director, along with Russia, had pushed a second proposal, known as ""de-linking,"" in which the IMF board would detach the doubling of resources from changes to the board structure, and the United States would be asked to temporarily give up its veto power until it ratified the reforms.

But Canuto said he did not know if that option was still feasible, as there had been no board debate on the options yet. No date was set for the discussion.

Mohan said that hardball tactics had sometimes been the only way the IMF had made progress with quota issues in the past. The current five-year delay in the latest reforms was unprecedented, however.

61531848-bef1-4f80-9cff-ad02af22b2cd,"tech Should You Buy the iPhone 6s? A review roundup of the new phones that are faster, stronger, and better at taking selfies. Jaime Fuller",News,New York Magazine,"The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale this Friday — if you're still on the fence about buying one or want to do some window-shopping, tech reviewers are starting to post their thoughts on the attention-grabbing gadgets online today. 
 
The main gist? Apple's new smartphones are faster and full of fun features — but they're perhaps not exciting enough for an upgrade if you already have an iPhone 6. 
 
Here's a roundup of what everyone thinks. 
 
It's fast. 
David Pogue at Yahoo  writes , ""If you operate an iPhone 6 side-by-side with an iPhone 6s, the difference hits you between the eyes. Opening apps, switching apps, processing things — it all happens faster on the 6s."" Sam Grobart at Bloomberg  says, "" Moving between apps is lightning fast. Fast-moving games are as smooth as Billy Dee Williams on a silk surfboard."" 
 
3D Touch is amazing — but it also might have limited utility now. 
Walt Mossberg at the Verge  called  the new multi-touch, pressure-sensitive screen the iPhone upgrade's ""most important new feature."" Others noted it takes a few days to figure out how hard to press the screen to get the features to work correctly. 
 
Brian X. Chen at the New York Times   disagreed : 
 
It was fun experimenting with 3D Touch, but I rarely felt compelled to use it. With my camera, my instinct continues to be to open the camera app by swiping up on the shortcut on the iPhone’s lock screen. When using email, I don’t bother to peek; I just open them. Unlike past touch gestures on the iPhone, like pinching or swiping, I found 3D Touch, in its current state, to be limited and mostly unnecessary. 
 
Grobart agreed that 3D Touch appears to have a limited utility at this point — although it is cool that Apple has invented it — and that it seems to work perfectly and could become even cooler with future models. Nilay Patel at the Verge adds , ""It's kind of easy to forget about 3D Touch, because only a selection of Apple's apps support it right now. It’s kind of like right click on OS X — the interface is designed to be used without it, but once you realize it's there, it’s incredibly useful, and you want every app to make solid, consistent use of it. In that sense, 3D Touch won’t really be that useful or revolutionary until third parties really grab onto it."" 
 
The new iPhone doesn't have better battery life. 
Which is  all Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal wanted : 
 
In our grueling test; which loops a series of websites with brightness set at around 65%, I found the 6s and 6s Plus get no more—but also no less—battery life than their predecessors ... There’s no innovation at the power outlet, either. While other phones employ wireless charging and rapid charging technology for added convenience, the new iPhones still require you to plug in your phone and wait at least two hours (nearly three for the Plus) to charge to 100%. 
 
Live Photos are fun, but maybe also useless. 
Stern  called  Apple's version of GIFs — which capture the seconds before and after a still photo is taken — ""the absolute best thing about the 6s."" John Paczkowski at BuzzFeed  said , ""Some are briefly humorous, others are totally worthless; but when you get a good one, it’s really something else. If I were a new parent, I would upgrade to the 6s for Live Photos alone. ... My daughters say Live Photos are a lot like the moving pictures in  Harry Potter , and they’re not all that far off."" Matthew Panzarino called them "" a crystal-clear still image, with a sense of place attached."" However, since they are basically videos, Live Photos can also take up lots of space.  
 
Siri is now waiting for you to call on her services at all times. 
Right now you have to hold the home-screen button in order to ask Siri a question. With the iPhone 6s, you can now just say ""Hey, Siri."" It is unclear if anyone is so busy that saving that one second of time is actually useful.  
 
The camera isn't noticeably better unless you are a serious photographer — but you will take better selfies. 
The iPhone 6's camera was already so good that many reviewers couldn't notice how the new advanced camera was any better — except for with selfies. The 6s offers a special, automatic ""selfie flash"" that illuminates your face before a smartphone self-portrait. Christina Bennington at Refinery29  writes , ""In many cases with low or uneven lighting, this pseudo-flash does a great job of making what would normally be a dark, un-usable image share-worthy, brightening the photo without turning the on-screen faces ghostly pale. In moderate, 'maybe I need a flash?' scenarios, the results are (perhaps unsurprisingly) hit or miss. Sometimes, the flash helps the image; other times, the additional lighting ends up harsh."" 
 
Why is Apple still offering 16GB phones, again? 
Another frequent criticism among tech reviewers was that iPhone base models still start at 16GB, even though the phones' increasingly sophisticated abilities take up a lot of memory. Some people  used their review  to quietly beg Apple to begin offering 32GB base models with the iPhone 7.  
 
If you own a really old iPhone, you might want to buy the new model. 
Everyone else,  Chen says , should wait until the next iPhone comes out — which will probably have even more exciting changes. Apple's smartphones usually only get small upgrades when they add an s ; when the iPhones graduate to a new number, that's when the big changes occur.  Pogue agrees : ""The iPhone 6 was already a spectacularly great phone. If you’d have to pay an early-termination fee to get the iPhone 6s, it’s probably not worth upgrading to the 6s."" 
 
You might also want to upgrade if you have a tendency to crack your phone screen. Several reviewers tried to break or bend the new iPhone, with little luck. New glass and new aluminum casing make the iPhone far less flimsy than its predecessors. The new case — and 3D Touch — do make the phone a tad heavier; Christina Warren at Mashable calls it "" three marshmallows"" heavier. ",1051,"The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus go on sale this Friday — if you're still on the fence about buying one or want to do some window-shopping, tech reviewers are starting to post their thoughts on the attention-grabbing gadgets online today.

That means more than half your money could be saved by paying just part way through using iOS 7. And although those savings will sound like cheap perks that most people won't bother trying until 2018 because phones start aging quickly before then thanks to high cost margins in 2012 it seems likely many millions would benefit from upgraded hardware over iPads; both iPhones share slightly better battery life due to higher levels lessening thermal emissions rather easily compared these days as Google makes devices thinner every year despite offering cheaper versions.)

Frenemies to the end! Any doubts that lingering tensions between Bethenny Frankel and Jill Zarin have eased over time were shot down when the SkinnyGirl mogul opened up to Andy Cohen about the feud in a new interview — and compared her former BFF to a hog 

! 

A preview clip of Cohen interviewing Frankel about the Real Housewives of New York City‘s 100th episode special reveals there is no love lost between Frankel and Zarin. 

Zarin and Frankel had been best friends prior to the show, but by Season Three, the relationship had run it’s course, with the two beginning a bitter feud. 

PHOTOS: Bethenny Frankel Shows off Bikini Body With Her Boy Toy 

Frankel revealed to Cohen, “I remember there was a turning point … I was hosting the Today show. When I got there, the first thing that was told to me by the producers was Jill called her and she lost her mind. ‘Why not me? I’m better than her.'” 

Frankel was then invited to appear on other entertainment shows in Los Angeles, which also irked Zarin, she said. 

“Listen, I’m not in a girl band,” Frankel joked.

! 

Then came the infamous phone call in Season Three in which Zarin tore into Frankel for not calling her husband Bobby after a medical procedure. 

The failed talk show host recalled, “It was like, ‘Whoa, this is one cunning b**ch. She’s waiting to be on camera to come at me with things and make America hate me!’ It was really clear that she wanted people to hate me.",331,Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Frenemies to the end!

She was also interviewed by Chris Rock for his first major television series ever: What Happened At The Dunes?

""Hate is an emotion you can't fathom,"" she said of sexual harassment, referring either solely or indirectly at both parties who seek help from public figures for their grievances against each other's companies while taking refuge under threat, citing recent cases where prominent victims' families called upon someone within private security – including two women whose husbands fled after being accused by three men inside theirs company during one such incident ""who knew how they felt""? The repost went back days later with another picture: it was taken hours before Wells Fargo did fire its chief executive as part just months earlier because he'd already made several sexist remarks relating toward female employees regarding his behavior towards then-CEO John Miliusi - all based off these accusations?

By Hideyuki Sano 
 
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares struggled to recover on Thursday with volatility remaining high, while emerging economy and commodity-linked currencies softened as investors worried about the global repercussions of slower growth in China. 
 
Japan's Nikkei <.n225> rose for the first time in four days, gaining 1.4 percent, while South Korea's Kospi <.ks11> edge up 0.4 percent, although MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan erased early gains. 
 
The rally came as Wall Street stocks jumped almost 2 percent on Wednesday, which traders saw as a natural move after big falls. Despite Wednesday's rebound, shares have only recovered  about half of the losses seen earlier in the week. 
 
Also helping to boost the market, Apple , the world's largest company by market capitalization, jumped more than 4 percent, in anticipation of its Sept 9 media event where it is expected to unveil new iPhones and potentially a new version of its Apple TV set-top box. 
 
Traders were spared for now from keeping a nail-biting watch on wild Chinese share markets, which are closed for a holiday for the rest of the week. 
 
Still, highlighting the woes that commodity exporters are suffering from concern about cooling growth in China, the Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent after weak local retail sales. 
 
The Aussie slipped to $0.7020 near its six-year low of $0.6982 touched on Wednesday. 
 
Oil prices also remained volatile after their 25 percent surge late last month. 
 
Brent crude fell 1.0 percent to $49.99 per barrel, slipping further from one-month high of $54.32 hit on Monday, though it kept some distance from a 6 1/2-year low of $42.23 hit just one week before that. 
 
HIGH VOLATILITY THE NEW NORM? 
 
While global share prices may be getting some respite, any relief rallies may be brief. 
 
With uncertainty over policy in the U.S. and China, investors expect trade to remain extremely choppy. The CBOE Volatility index <.vix> is still at 26 percent, about twice as high as its usual levels around 12 to 16 percent. 
 
A similar gauge for the Japanese share market, the Nikkei volatility index <.jniv>, stood at 35 percent. 
 
""The fact that the volatility index is staying at a such high level points to unstable markets down the road. We may need clearer signs of stabilization in China,"" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank. 
 
In the currency market, the dollar firmed slightly against the yen, in line with recovery in global share prices, to 120.65 yen. The euro was little changed at $1.1220 , ahead of the European Central Bank's policy meeting later in the day, with some traders speculating the bank could drop hints of further easing to keep the euro zone's nascent recovery in shape. 
 
On the other hand, many emerging market currencies remained under pressure, hit by China fears and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates. 
 
The Brazilian real tumbled to its weakest level since 2002 on Wednesday as expectations of a growing fiscal deficit fed fears that Brazil would lose its investment-grade credit rating. 
 
Emerging market currencies could face more pressure if Friday's U.S. payrolls data reinforce expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve is on course to raise interest rates in coming months. 
 
On Wednesday, U.S payroll processor ADP reported that private payrolls increased 190,000 last month. While that was below economists' expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs, it was a step up from the 177,000 positions created in July.

  U2 play at Turin's Pala Alpitour Arena as the band kicks off the European leg of their Innocence and Experience tour  
          
Rock giants U2 have drawn attention to the plight of refugees and called for ""humanitarian leadership"" as they kicked off the European leg of their world tour. 
 
Frontman and activist Bono, who addressed Turin's packed Pala Alpitour in Italian on a number of occasions, said he did not have the answers to the refugee crisis but added that we ""must work together"" to find the solution. 
 
And in an interview with the Press Association, the band's bass player Adam Clayton spoke of the ""anger"" felt by Europeans who he says are questioning why their governments cannot seem to ""do the right thing"". 
 
The image of a young Syrian boy washed ashore in Turkey earlier this week sparked outrage and calls for governments throughout Europe to do more to help the tens of thousands of refugees. 
 
Bono made reference to the shocking incident by changing the lyrics in Pride (In the Name of Love) to: ""One boy washed up on an empty beach."" 
 
The image of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying face down in the sand made headlines around the world, becoming a focal point for the deepening refugee crisis. 
 
In a set that included more than two dozen of the band's songs and at one point featured a screen showing footage of refugees, Bono said: ""There is a lot of heartache in the world, but there is so much joy in here this evening. 
 
""Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's incredible. 
 
""Watching the news, ordinary people - all of us - seem capable of such great evil and such great love. 
 
""I don't know the answer to the refugee crisis in Europe and Africa but I know we must work together to find an answer to the refugee crisis in Europe and Africa."" 
 
He added: ""As Nelson Mandela said: 'It always seems impossible until it is done.'"" 
 
Bono asked the crowd: ""What do you want? A Europe with its heart and borders closed to mercy? Or a Europe with its heart open?"" 
 
Aylan's father Abdullah Kurdi has said he hopes the photograph of his son will bring attention to the plight of refugees. 
 
""I just hope this photo of my son will change everything,"" he told reporters. 
 
Later, bass player Clayton told PA: ""We really like to be able to respond to things as quickly as possible and you know the way the migration really has been covered in the last couple of weeks, you can feel there's a lot of anger out there amongst the citizens of the European nations and they just don't know why their governments can't seem to kind of do the right thing or at least lead on these issues."" 
 
Guitarist The Edge said: ""Every nation should step forward and do the best they can."" 
 
Asked if there was scope for a concert in the style of Band Aid to raise more awareness and funds for refugees, Clayton said: ""I think that's a secondary issue. But I think primarily we're in a situation where we have elected leaders who need to show leadership. 
 
""Because we don't know all the issues, we don't know all the information here. 
 
""But definitely, we need to see some humanitarian leadership from Europe."" 
 
Commenting on whether U2 would get on board with a Band Aid style event, The Edge said: ""I think we'd take it very seriously, but again, as Adam says, it might not be the right response since it couldn't be any more high profile."" 
 
He added that it was more an issue for governments. 
 
The Edge told PA that the band tries to touch on issues that are relevant, adding: ""We feel like our music should be a reference to what's happening in the milieu around it."" 
 
During the concert Bono also made reference to a future where no babies are born with HIV. 
 
""If you tell your leaders this is important to you it will be important to them,"" he said. 
 
The set included tracks such as Sunday Bloody Sunday, Bullet the Blue Sky and Beautiful Day. 
 
U2 will play a string of nights at The O2 in London as well as dates in Glasgow before finishing the Innocence and Experience tour in Paris on November 15.",732,"11:06am Saturday 5th September 2015 in © Press Association 2014 U2 play at Turin's Pala Alpitour Arena as the band kicks off the European leg of their Innocence and Experience tour Rock giants U2 have drawn attention to the plight of refugees and called for ""humanitarian leadership"" as they kicked off the European leg of their world tour.

The 36-year-old from Dalgety Bay, a winner last time out at Knockhill, entered the weekend just 11 points behind the Volkswagen of championship leader Jason Plato. 


But while Shedden lines up third on the grid in his Honda, double champ Plato — whose car was carrying 75kg 'success' ballast — could only manage a frustrating sixth. 


""It's certainly a boost to be starting ahead of Jason,"" 2012 champ Shedden, who delivered a banzai final lap to clock 1min 22.300secs, just 0.213s behind the Ford of polesitter Mat Jackson, said today.

""We've only nine races left in the season, so every grid position and point is crucial. But I've won four times here in the past, so hopefully we can manage that again in either race one or two. 


""The important thing is to leave here with a  good haul of points. Yeh it would terrific to lead the championship into the next round at Silverstone, but as long as I'm in the mix for the title when we get to the finale at Brands, I'll be happy."" 


Jackson, who edged out the Volkswagen of Aron Smith, smashed the 2013 lap record set by Plato by clocking 1:22.087s. It was Jackson's first pole since 2009, when he drove a Chevrolet. 


Dalkeith youngster, 18-year-old Aiden Moffat, built on his third place at Knockhill by qualifying his Mercedes eighth, immediately ahead of past champs Colin Turkington (VW) and Andrew Jordan (MG).

7db693dc-eef0-4191-a162-247f9ed127f4,Britain could face diesel drought,News,Business Matters Magazine,"British motorists are facing a potential “diesel drought” because the country has too few refineries capable of producing the fuel, reports The Telegraph . 
 
Demand for diesel fuel has grown by 76 per cent over the past 20 years as more consumers have shifted to the traditionally more economical option. 
 
But the RAC Foundation is warning that by 2030 diesel will outsell petrol in service stations by four litres to one. As more refineries are shut down and existing facilities not updated, this will mean that the UK will become increasingly dependent on imports. 
 
Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: “Today, every other car bought is a diesel, but our refineries have struggled to keep pace with demand and have not attracted the investment they need to switch over from petrol production.” 
 
According to the RAC Foundation, in 2009 there were nine major refineries in the UK but today there are six, with many of these up for sale. 
 
The potential shortfall in domestic diesel supplies is also due to some older refineries being configured to produce petrol rather than diesel, said the foundation. 
 
Refining in the UK is in decline. New investment has fallen into updating facilities capable of processing new fuels, which comply with European Union emissions regulations. 
 
In February, Total said that it would reduce the workforce at the Lindsey refinery in Lincolnshire to 400 workers, from a staff of around 580, and halve production by about 5m tonnes of fuel at the site. 
In 2013, Ineos threatened to close the giant Grangemouth refinery and petrochemicals complex in Scotland after racking up losses in the region of £600m over the past four years. 
 
The UK became a net importer of petroleum products, including car lubricants and petrol, by a margin of some 2m tonnes in 2013, according to government data, which also revealed a 0.7 per cent decline in the consumption of fuels for transport over the same period. 
 
“Most of our refineries – some of which are more than half a century old – were built when diesel was a niche product. Retrofitting them is a billion-pound decision that has failed to stack up for investors who see refining as a low-margin business despite our sky-high pump prices,” said Mr Gooding. 
 
The report claims the number of diesel cars has risen dramatically, from 1.6m in 1994 to 11m in 2014. The number of heavy goods vehicles has also climbed: from 421,000 in 1994 to 474,000 in 2014. But this is below the pre-recession peak of 510,000 in 2007. 
 
Concern over diesel shortages comes as oil prices hit multi-year lows of under $50 per barrel, driving down the cost of fuel for consumers. However, the RAC Foundation is concerned that growing dependence on fuel imports could undermine savings from lower crude prices. 
 
“Recently motorists have benefited from falling forecourt prices. We should be concerned about the potential for things to go the other way,” said Mr Gooding.",492,"British motorists are facing a potential “diesel drought” because the country has too few refineries capable of producing the fuel, reports The Telegraph . Demand for diesel fuel has grown by 76 per cent over the past 20 years as more consumers have shifted to the traditionally more economical option. But the RAC Foundation is warning that by 2030 diesel will outsell petrol in service stations by four litres to one.

Steve Gooding, director of the RAC",2015-09-16T08:55:55Z," Institute told MailOnline: ""We don't see any end game happening at around 25 miles an hour,"" but many new vehicles already running can be used through British duty-free refuelings each year with or without tax credits instead."""," report said: ""At present we can expect almost three billion British cars running at 10-hour intervals every year which puts us behind other European powerhouses such China – particularly South Korea - where people who do some driving use up only 15% or 70pc less energy compared with what they would save having access enough electricity.""


The Daily Mirror points Out, noting how German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Germany's decision about renewable generation its 'best way forward' after she visited London last fall stating many Germans had lost faith from green legislation despite increasing usage rates already high across Europe while EU officials were trying hard make progress towards implementing new domestic policies so Britain could move ahead when it gets back closer to reducing emissions altogether (in full):"," report said: ""This puts us two decades behind other developed countries globally,"" while Tony Watson from Friends believe it could leave an impact elsewhere around Asia if new models don't work at home.""
There's also no doubt VW can cut its production rate under any circumstance - but they're betting their customers won´t pay much price today given where prices stand now; there was simply some real frustration about how low emissions were when we found ourselves driving less than 10km/h (7mph). I think anyone with internet or mobile data plans would agree having just turned 90 means what you need then? Also keep going"

Looking into how bullish CMOS continues not looking so confident about holding its ground then there's a small risk I have yet heard – buy up even earlier as if that means selling soon tomorrow when market conditions return! So what happens now? Well after 5PM traders go out early one minute here. As expected my head just seems too big! It should be late (10pm ET) until trade gets dark enough!! But no news since all trades would take place by 7:30 am   Please wait while your eyes bleed…… Thank You SaaS!!!"," so do not panic if your coins hold high or higher! No sign one thing will be going with today's move as they have made a huge trade since 9 months ago but no more bullish moves right now because he said that any time his bulls cannot deal fast what things could happen next I believe 100% when my first position got to me there was probably another 3 hours where every dollar would rise back upwards even though each day went downwards based on market forces – 2 minutes = $1760 x 1036 maturities which means only 50 outriders left 🙂 My other big bull-moveing idea here: Invest just 5 times… If 90 people get together then let them invest over 500 per week before losing 40 dollars from us all through B2B transactions. This way everyone profits while keeping under half year old value stocks too low 😉
This morning i saw about 15x100m share trades spread among exchanges between 8+ participants who didn't join without signing up early (for two"," but now seems to be holding above 75 when looking through all day time horizons - even though today's position reflects that move! Now I will take out my personal investment advice from David here.. There IS hope left over coming back because if there were any signs tomorrow which would make him feel comfortable buying a few more shares or maybe he stays put as well:)
And not just ""in case"". While trading may seem easy so far (and much closer than usual), having faith might come next month… 😡"

737cffd2-6560-410c-967b-f2ab9948dc4e,Global goals must fight the poor nutrition that kills 3 million children every year,News,Guardian.co.uk,"The sustainable development goals need to reflect the complex causes of malnutrition in order to tackle one of the world’s foremost health challenges One of the final acts in the lengthy process of creating a new set of global sustainable development goals (SDGs) was completed last weekend when world leaders formally adopted 17 goals and 169 targets. But for those of us who seek to tackle the world’s collective failing in ensuring adequate nutrition for all, the battle is just beginning.

Draft indicators for each target, which will measure the achievements of the SDGs, will not be finalised until next March. When they have been agreed, we should be in a better position to judge whether the SDGs are adequate to address one of the world’s foremost health challenges: the triple burden of malnutrition (or undernutrition), micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity. | Globally, levels of hunger and undernutrition remain unacceptably high, with one in nine people worldwide suffering from chronic hunger and close to 2 billion overweight and obese. Undernutrition is responsible for the deaths of some 3 million children each year. 

We feel there should be three priorities as we drive the fight against malnutrition forward. First, the assumption that nutrition and hunger are the same must be challenged. The SDGs, unlike the millennium development goals (MDGs), strongly link hunger and nutrition. The goal of ensuring adequate nutrition could easily be missed because of a commonly held assumption that hunger and nutrition are the same thing. This must be challenged because it privileges action on hunger over nutrition. as they do to tackling hunger. This may be because popular conceptions of hunger are clearer, and historically it has been a political rallying point. But overcoming the triple burden of malnutrition is not only about better food security, but also about more sustainable and healthy diets, better systems of support for mothers and infant care, and better health and sanitation. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Internally displaced Pakistani women wait for relief goods in Larkana, 2010. Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/ Second, the new SDG indicators should adopt existing World Health Assembly indicators. While it is positive that goal 2 explicitly promises to “end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” by 2030, achieving a good set of nutrition-relevant indicators is critical. This is how we can guarantee action at country level. Many nutrition advocates, including prominent UN bodies, have argued for the adoption of the indicators already agreed by health ministers at the 2012 WHA. As it stands, “nutrition” is still buried within the goals and targets of the SDGs. There is no place for malnutrition in the 21st century | Lawrence Haddad, Corinna Hawkes and Emorn Udomkesmalee While stunting in children – an important measure of overall child growth and development that was missing from the MDGs – is included, other WHA indicators, which try to capture the complexity of nutrition and its determinants, are missing. These include child wasting, rates of exclusive breastfeeding, and anaemia in girls. An additional indicator on women’s dietary diversity is being promoted by some UN agencies. At least the WHA indicator on childhood obesity is in there. But we should go further in tracking obesity in both children and adults. Obesity is often a driver of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes. NCDs rightly feature in the high-level political goals, but so should obesity. One wonders at the politics which led to its relegation to the technical indicators rather than the political goals.

Third, the collection of good quality data is critical. The decisions on the indicators will drive global data collection efforts, policy debates and interventions over the coming 15 years. Good quality internationally comparable data is desperately needed to tackle malnutrition. This requires systematic monitoring of both efforts and outcomes by governments, development partners, civil society and researchers. Because the results of the SDGs will take time to materialise, data on government efforts, such as policies, laws and investment, must be closely monitored.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest An image from 2002 of a baby in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. 42 million children under the age of five were overweight or obese in 2013. Photograph: Peter Parks/AFP/ International rankings such as the Institute of Development Studies’ Hunger and Nutrition Commitment Index (Hanci), launched today, already work to foster greater accountability. Hanci measures political commitment to tackling hunger and undernutrition in 45 developing countries by looking at available data on government spending, policies and legal frameworks. This approach is an example of how to assess SDG progress, alongside critical work being carried out to assess wider progress on nutrition, such as the recently launched global nutrition report.

To effectively address malnutrition over the coming decades, we must monitor efforts and outcomes at a technical level and demand profound political commitment to this drive. Only then will the battle against malnutrition find its place in the “all in it together” universalism that has been hailed as the radical new approach at the heart of the SDGs.

Earlier today State Governor K Chandrababu Naidoo spoke about his country becoming ""the most developed nation""-albeit yet another attempt to create big business dependency within agriculture sectors; especially among top brass whose portfolios involve industrial production or irrigation management projects like dams being built along rivers but under water restrictions while developing some small infrastructure developments around them"," month before being used into action as part
But it cannot change our outlook if we do neither deliver an accurate vision nor address some long-standing weaknesses or shortcomings by ourselves; rather I wish to provide advice on ways that other countries can take advantage from this latest meeting – but first steps must now lie ahead—to better manage these issues so they become properly addressed at national level without overstating them already existing efforts are well underway.

The new site is the product of a collaboration between Washington 

Wood – the only building material that is grown by the power of the sun – is a renewable resource that has a low carbon and energy footprint. Using wood from sustainably managed forests will significantly reduce carbon emissions from the building sector. 

According to a Yale University study, substituting wood for more energy-intensive building materials would reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 14 to 31 percent because wood consumes much less energy than concrete or steel construction.

""Wood construction is incredibly fast and effective, with the added benefit of producing a building that stores carbon rather than emitting it,"" says Canadian architect Michael Green. ""The only way to achieve a net-zero building is to build with wood."" 

As timber grows, it soaks up carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and that carbon is stored in wood products. This creates a carbon sink that helps mitigate climate change. About half of the dry weight of wood is stored carbon. In contrast, 16 percent of global fossil fuel consumption goes into manufacturing steel, concrete and bricks.

""This collaboration between Oregon 

""Wood products are carbon-negative because they sequester and store carbon,"" says Joseph Mayo 

""The forest landowners and lumber manufacturers in the Pacific Northwest are the largest supplier of wood building materials in the nation,"" says Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. ""Using those wood products in new and better ways will benefit both the environment and the economies of Oregon 

Wood's strength-to-weight ratio is comparable to concrete and steel. Engineered wood products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT), glue-laminated timber (glulam) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) make it possible to build taller wood structures. These mass timber construction materials are highly fire-resistant and cost-effective. Prefabricated CLT panels can also be installed quickly, speeding up construction time. 

""As global demand for wood continues to increase with population, we need to be sourcing our timber from sustainably managed forests,"" says Thomas Maness 

About the Innovative Wood Products Collaborative:

The Innovative Wood Products Collaborative is co-sponsored by the Oregon Forest Resources Industries and the Washington Forest Protection Association to promote the use of wood from sustainably managed forests in the Pacific Northwest.

About the Oregon Forest Resources Institute:

The Oregon Legislature created the Oregon Forest Resources Institute in 1991 to advance public understanding of the state's forest resources and to encourage environmentally sound forest management through training and other educational programs for forest landowners. OFRI is funded by a dedicated harvest tax on forest products producers. For more information, go to OregonForests.org.
