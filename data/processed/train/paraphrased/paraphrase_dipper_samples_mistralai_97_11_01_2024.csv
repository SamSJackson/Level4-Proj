Task: 

1. Analyze John Lubbock's statement that one's character is chosen by oneself.
2. Compare and contrast how others, such as one's mother, can teach you how to behave, but cannot choose one's character.
3. Explore how sometimes it can be necessary to change one's character in order to help oneself or others.
4. Discuss the importance of having a good character and a positive attitude.","The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote you your character will be what you yourself choose. In my opinion we choose our own character, and how we respect other people teachers, and students. My mom teach me how to behavior but she do not choose my own character, nonetheless some peoples make us strong but they don't choose own character, but on the other hand sometimes we need to change our character for example, my English teacher have a beautiful character but apart from that, sometime she need to changes her character because the students do not put attention in the classroom, and she have to be rude that way they stop talking and distract the other students, but however she never change her beautiful character.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress. My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be

In other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile.","John Lubbock's assertion that one's character is self-chosen underscores personal autonomy and the power to shape one's inner being. While others, like a loving mother, can impart essential life lessons and social manners, they cannot install a good character. A good character encompasses honesty, compassion, responsibility, and positivity, among others. Essentially, we must decide which moral tenets influence our behaviour, both when facing life's difficulties and choices and when aiming to help ourselves and others. Cultivating a good character isn't only crucial to leading a virtuous and healthy life, but it sets an example that positively influences those around us. Additionally, altering our character contributes to personal growth that fosters stronger and more rewarding relationships. In conclusion, although external factors may shape aspects of behaviour, the essence of one's character lies within our choice and is integral to establishing a meaningful and well-rounded identity."," John Lubbock's assertion that one's character is self-chosen acknowledges the significance of personal responsibility in shaping one's moral makeup. However, while one's character is a product of individual choices, influence from others, particularly parents, plays a crucial role in the learning process of how to behave. Despite their ability to teach, they cannot dictate one's character, which must be forged through personal growth and decision-making.

There are circumstances where changing one's character becomes necessary, such as seeking self-improvement or helping those around us. This transformation hinges on the understanding that a positive character and attitude are essential for both personal fulfillment and societal harmony. Consequently, embodying virtues like kindness, empathy, and honesty, in turn, becomes the crucial foundation for meaningful relationships and personal growth.","John Lubbock's assertion that one's character is The idea that one's character is a choice, which can be expressed in many ways, underscores the importance of personal autonomy and the power to shape our inner being. While others may teach us important life lessons like compassion, responsibility, and positivity, they cannot install - or even make up for it -- ","John Lubbock's assertion that one's character is The idea that one's character is a product of his or her own choices, however, does not fully explain the importance of personal responsibility in shaping moral behavior.

Task:

1. Research the artist Michelangelo and his views on setting goals.
2. Analyze examples of taking risks and SETTING BIG goals by taking a look at a SHOW called Masterchef and analyzing a personal example of passing a permit test.
3. Explore how taking risks and failING can make you a better person.
4. Examine how Michelangelo and the writer agree on why it is better to set a bigger goal and fail rather than have a","In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy."," Michelangelo, the Renaissance master, believed in the power of ambition and risk-taking, as shown by his pursuing ambitious projects and overcoming challenges. In ""Masterchef,"" contestants exhibit similar attitudes, took big risks in creating unique dishes, and sometimes failing magnificently yet learnically. My personal story of passing a tough permit test is linked, as preparation, multiple attempts, and determination eventually yielded success. Likewise, both Michelangelo and the writer argue that settling for lesser goals yields lesser experiences, making failures stepping stones to success."," Title: Michelangelo's Art of Setting Bold Goals: Risks, Failures, and Personal Growth

Michelangelo, the renowned Italian artist, believed that setting lofty goals was integral to human growth. Similar sentiments are resonated in the show ""Masterchef,"" where contestants strive for culinary mastery. Michelangelo and the Masterchef contestants share a common thread: the willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of ambitious goals.

For instance, the Masterchef contestants risk their confidence each week as they present their creations, hoping to impress the judges. This echoes Michelangelo's approach, who took significant risks in his art, such as his daring painting of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.

The fear of failure is inevitable in both realms, but as Michelangelo famously stated, ""The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it."" By setting big, seemingly unattainable goals, we step outside our comfort zones and open ourselves to personal growth. Through the process of striving, we learn from our mistakes, develop resilience, and ultimately transform into stronger, wiser individuals.","Michelangelo, the Renaissance master, believed in the In ""Masterchef,"" he is shown to have taken great risks and overcome challenges, as in the story of his master's students who passed their permit tests.

Task: Write an essay exploring the question ""Do we have to live other people's experiences?""","Do we have to live other people experiences?

If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.

People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I don't really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.

If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.

Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.

Don't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.

Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know. Fight for what you really want no matter what comes next."," title: Living Other People's Experiences: A Choices Matter Philosophy

Our lives are defined by a series of experiences, shaping us into who we are. But, the question arises, do we have an obligation to partake in the experiences of others to truly understand them? Absolutely not. While resonating with others is essential, we should not compromise our individuality, freedom, and unique perspectives. Each person holds a distinct universe of thoughts and emotions, fueling our worldview. Embrace your journey and respect that everyone else has a distinct one to follow. Life becomes an art, with choices and chances waiting at every corner. So, live yours fully - yours is the only experience truly yours to own."," Title: Living Other People's Experiences: A Necessity or an Option?

Living other people's experiences is a complex question that touches the very core of human connection and empathy. While we may not be able to fully live someone else's life, we can gain valuable insights and understanding through their stories, experiences, and perspectives. This not only enriches our own lives but also fosters tolerance and builds bridges across cultural and social divides.

The advent of technology in the 21st century revolutionized communication with easier access to the Internet, enabling instant text and video messaging, and international conferencing. Yet, over-reliance on digital screens may contribute to visual issues such as screen addiction, blurry vision, and digital eye strain. Additionally, reduced face-to-face social interaction could exacerbate emotional isolation. For libraries, the transition from traditional materials brought about the need for digital databases, scanning machines, eBook collections, and the ever-present challenge to maintain relevance in the age of readily available information. Yet, preserving physical books is essential, as their history cannot be replaced entirely by a digital interface. Technique-savvy librarians and digital tools like e-learning and remote services can promote inclusive access for all while maintaining an engaging learning environment grounded in the human touch and the timeless written word. Additionally, scheduling regular breaks from screens may augment social interaction by providing ample mental energy for face-face conversations, reducing the sedentary lifestyle associated with technology excess. Encouragement of outdoor activities may also improve our visual capabilities as technology consumption decreases. Combusting excessive screen times by blending traditional practices with digital advantages proves a promising approach, creating harmony amid technological progress for a more balanced and healthy culture."," Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Technology: Communication, Vision Issues, and Libraries in the 21st Century

Technology's impact on communication, vision issues, and libraries in the 21st century is profound.

Libraries have morphed from physical spaces to digital repositories, rendering obsolete conventional methods of book retrieval. Yet, to minimize negative consequences, digital detoxes, and implementing the 20-20-20 rule (every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away) can prevent vision issues.

Thomas Jefferson astutely emphasized the importance of staying active for achieving success when he declared, ""I'm a great believer in putting idle hours to the best account."" Procrastination and disorganization can derail both professional and personal growth. beingmotivated and organized are integral to staying productive and realizing goals. Motivation ignites the fuel in the form of passion, enthusiasm, and determination; it drives individuals to tackle tasks head-on instead of putting things off. Staying organized categorizes workflow, allocates time effectively, and helps prioritize tasks-a necessary element to accomplishing desired objectives. Eluding procrastination and adhering to responsibility are potent weapons that, aroused by intrinsic or extrinsic factors, fuel the journey to success."," Title: Motivation, Organization, and Thomas Jefferson's Recipe for Success

Thomas Jefferson once said, ""I'm a great believer in clockwork and constancy. I arrange my time table in units as small as an hour. I believe that every second of life is a precious moment and should be lived to its fullest potential."" This quote underscores the importance of motivation, organization, and the pitfalls of procrastination.

Being motivated and organized equips us with the focus and determination necessary to accomplish tasks. It eliminates distractions and fosters efficient time management. Moreover, it fosters a sense of responsibility and enables us to make progress towards our goals.

Procrastination, on the other hand, can hinder our ability to reach our full potential. By avoiding tasks until the last minute, we often sacrifice the quality of our work, add undue stress, and miss out on valuable learning opportunities. Thomas Jefferson's emphasis on staying active and maintaining a consistent routine is a powerful reminder of the benefits of motivation and organization in achieving success.",Title: The Power of Motivation and Organization In Achieving Success: Thomas Jefferson’s Perspective on the Power of Motivation and Organization ,"Title: Motivation, Organization, and Thomas Jefferson's Recipe For Success Thomas Jefferson once said, ""I'm a great believer in the clockwork and constancy of time.

Distance learning provides students with unprecedented flexibility, enabling them to attend classes from home utilizing online or video conferencing tools. While the convenience of learning from one’s own space saves commute time and accommodation fees, the downside consists of numerous factors. Inability to maintain complete focus in the absence of a traditional classroom and the constant distractions may negatively impact concentration levels. Likewise, restricted access to the abundant on-campus resources, particularly high-end labs and libraries, is a disadvantage. Cost-savings, thus, comes at the expense of missing out on invaluable real-world experiences. Additionally, the absence of face-to-face social interaction perpetuates the need for alternative virtual channels for social engagement; however, the ever present risk of online bullying looms large in the absence of campus supervision to maintain order. Lastly, the proximity to home allows for the seductive convenience of online shopping, leading to potential excessive consumption and convenience being a double-edged sword. In conclusion, distance learning demands thoughtful consideration and strategic balancing of its potential pros and cons."," Title: Distance Learning: Home-Based Education: Pros and Cons

Task:

1. Research different views on the statement that people must do something else to be successful in the world.
2. Analyze an example of when people are influenced by others when making choices related to their career.
3. Explain why it is important to make decisions using your heart rather than depending on what others might say.
4. Examine how failure and making mistakes can help people grow and understand what it takes to be successful.
5. Discuss the benefits","The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success.

First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves.

Otherwise,

they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going.

People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you won't regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves.

Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed.

In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief. Also, by being patience on making important decisions, since, everything takes time. And, do not be afraid on doing what you love because it brings you to the way to be success."," title: Breaking Free: The Importance of Followulating Heartfelt Decisions for Career Success

The debate rages on whether people must adapt to external factors to succeed. While some claim necessity (Jennifer Deal and Karie Willyerd, 55 Million Reesons To Hire With a Human Touch, 2012),others advocated followng heart (Steve Jobs, Stanford Graduation speech, 2005). A prime example of this tension lies in the tech industry - Steve Wozniak, a fiery innovator, initially rejected corporate norms, eventually aligning with a more conservative figure (Steve Jobs), shaping Apple into an industry icon. Making heartfelt decisions is essential as their impacts, particularly in relationships and personal growth, often extend beyond the momentary discomfort of departure from external guidelines (Brene Brown's TED Talk, 2012). Ultimately, the experiences born of failure and mistakes can foster invaluable learning experiences enriching our path to success (Bethany Mckeehan for Forbes, 7 Important Lessons About Learning From Failure, 2019). These benefits fuel the curiosity responsible for the achievements society recognizes – illustrating how the journey to success remains unconstrained by an arbitrary dependence upon others opinions and constraints."," Title: The Road to Success: Heart over Hype

For example, a friend's successful law career may sway an individual to pursue law, despite an interest in art.

However, it's essential to listen to your heart to make informed decisions. This method leads to authenticity and personal fulfillment. Failure and mistakes allow us to learn from experience, fostering resilience and valuable lessons. Ultimately, success depends on staying true to personal values and aspirations.

2. Create a list of ways you can support a loved one that is going through a difficult time 
3. Write a personal narrative about a loved one that maintained a positive attitude during a difficult time 
4. Write an essay on why having a positive attitude is important, even during difficult times","There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.

I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.

While your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.

I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me.

One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said ''its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good."," Title: Thriving Through Trials: The Power of Positivity in Adversity

    Task: Write an essay exploring the situations where students might not have the time or energy to stay for two extra hours in school and how this can affect them.","Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep."," Title: Extracurricular Commitments and the Impact on Students

The increasingly heavy academic workload, combined with extracurricular activities and personal obligations, often leaves students fatigued or pressed for time. Staying an extra two hours in school isn't a viable solution for every learner. For some, this could mean neglecting important personal responsibilities or mental health. For others, schoolwork could pile up, leading to added stress and reduced academic performance. In extreme cases, regular absenteeism from afternoon sessions can threaten one's standing within a grade or even in the long term. In conclusion, schools must recognize the need for a balance between academic rigor, student lives, and personal growth. Offering flexible alternatives, adjustable academic deadlines, as well as effective learning resources, could help accommodate the heterogeneous learning styles of students and ensure they remain dedicated and well-rounded individuals."," Title: The Consequences of Extended School Hours: A Student's Perspective

Being a student involves a multitude of responsibilities, from academics to extracurricular activities. However, not all students have the luxury of staying for two extra hours in school daily. This time crunch can have significant repercussions.

First, students may miss important family gatherings or commitments, leading to feelings of guilt or stress. Additionally, they might forfeit after-school jobs or internships necessary for financial support, limiting their earning potential. Furthermore, the energy required to maintain high academic performance alongside extensive extracurricular involvement can leave students drained. Skimping on rest can negatively impact concentration, cognitive functioning, and overall well-being.

In conclusion, while additional hours at school may offer advantages, the pressure placed upon students to attend must be balanced with their personal obligations and physical wellness. Schools should consider offering flexible schedules and alternative methods for students to access learning materials and resources while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.",Title: Extracurricular Commitments and the Impact on The Student's Academic and Personal Commitments. ,Title: The Consequences of Extended School Hours: A Student’s Perspective , The student’s extracurricular commitments and the impact on his or her academic and personal commitment. , The consequences of extended school hours: , The student’s extracurricular commitments and the impact on his or her academic and personal life. , The consequences of extended school hours:

Working in a group can be more beneficial than working alone for several reasons. Firstly, collective intelligence allows for a wider range of ideas, perspectives, and solutions. For instance, during a group project at university, I had the opportunity to brainstorm with my team about our marketing strategy. Each member's unique insights led us to develop a well-rounded strategy that resulted in superior performance compared to our competitors.

Secondly, accountability and motivation come into play. Knowing that others are relying on you encourages personal responsibility and diligence. Conversely, working alone can lead to procrastination and a lack of direction.

Counterclaims, such as potential conflicts and time wastage, can be addressed through effective communication and time management skills. By fostering an inclusive and respectful environment, we can minimize conflicts and maximize productivity. Additionally, setting clear goals and deadlines ensure that everyone stays on track. Thus, the benefits of collaboration significantly outweigh the potential challenges.","Working in a group can be more The group approach is more productive than working alone, because the diversity of thought and viewpoints enables greater efficiency in complex projects.

think is good and bad idea.

I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble.

the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision.

if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn,

they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future.

If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.

If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up.

if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers.

Write an essay exploring the importance of using life experience and guidance from experts (e.g. family, friends) when making decisions. Use personal anecdotes to support your argument.","LIFE DECISIONS

In every part of our life, we need someone to share something with them.

Maybe they are our family or friends.

In these days, people are more self-reliance. They think, we don't need anyone to guidance us.

But I think in every moment of life, we need someone, who had a lot of experts to guidance us.

Father and mother are the best persons, to share our everything in our life.

They have a lot of experience and important matters in life. They can feel us In every situation.

We always should ask from our mother or father, about our life decisions.

we should have someone to hear us and support us.

Our parent experience can be a lesson for us.

Experiences make our life. We should learn something from the experiences.

Life is full of thing, actually new thing. Everyday we meet a new thing in our life. That we don't know what is it? and where is it come from? Our parent are older than us, they know everything. They were in our age and now they're older than us. thats means, they understand better about us and about our situation.

My mom she always feel me. If i am sad even if i didn't tell her she know that I am sad. Because she's older than me. She was in my age before me.

We are like a person that don't know about anything, because everything is new for us. Because we don't have any experiences of the thing.

My uncle, he was 17 years old. He wanted to open a small fast food in our country. He always just listen to himself.

He didn't share anything with anyone until he did the work, than he comes and tell us that what I did.

Everyone was sad about him because he was younger and he don't know about anything.

His mother and father told him to finish school first then open a fast food, but he didn't listened to them.

He leaved the school and started his work. In the first he was so happy, but after a few months he become sad.

When he saw his all friends going to school and he works he felt sad.

He was so regretful, because of what he did. He didn't listen to his parent and he just did what he wants.

Than he came to his parent and said sorry, because of not sharing his idea with his parents.

My grandfather said to him"" I was in your age, I did the same mistake that you did, but in different way. I told you to school is the first important thing in our life, you can't leave an important thing in life"".""I had the experience that why i was trying to tell you that. ""My son always share whatever you have in your mind with the person that you can trust and believe, and listen to them, they will always guide you"".

Finally he understood, what he did was wrong, but he also like to work too.

That time he came to his father and share that he wants to study and work.

His father was so happy that his son come and asked him for showing the good way.

His father guide him and show him that what should he do.

He went to school and also continued his work too.

Right now he's a businessman, he always says"" to us to share anything with your family or friends"".

He said that to us"" the way that I am success and a good businessman was my dad experience, my dad guidance"".

I learn from my uncle that if your mom and dad teach you how to speak and how to eat and.... they also can teach us how to life good.

I always ask from my mom and share my day happens with her.

She hear me and feel me. Sometime before i say anything she know, I'm thinking about what and what I want to tell her. Having the experience are good, you know better how to solve a problem and guide someone who trust you.

If I have a plan for future I will share it with my mom, she support me and guide me.

In my college years, a mentor introduced me to various career opportunities that broadened my perspective when deciding on my education path.

Life experiences and expert guidance are invaluable resources in the complex world of decision-making. Each experience, whether joyful or painful, shapes our perspective, enriches our wisdom, and equips us with insights for the future. For instance, my first failed business venture taught me the importance of thorough planning and financial management.

Experts, be it family or friends, offer wisdom hard-earned through their own experiences and knowledge. Their guidance offers invaluable perspective and helps prevent repetition of mistakes. For example, my aunt's advice on pursuing higher education opened my eyes to unlimited opportunities, leading me to secure a well-paying job.

Harnessing the power of both life experiences and expert guidance allows us to make well-informed decisions, learn from our mistakes, and grow as individuals. Ultimately, the combination of intuition born from personal experience and the expertise of trusted individuals forms a powerful tool for navigating life's challenges.",Title: The Value of Experience and Expert The Value of Life Experience and Expert Guidance in Decision-Making: A Personal Perspective ,Title: The Wise Balance: Harnessing Life Experience The Power of Life Experiences and Expert Guidance in Decision-Making , - The Value of Life Experience and Expert Guidance in Decision Making: A Personal Perspective , The Wise Balance: Using Life Experience and Expert Guidance in Decision-Making , “The Value of Life Experience and Expert Guidance in Decision Making: A Personal Perspective.” , The wisest balance: Using Life Experience and Expert Guidance in Decision-Making.

Moreover, after two month the manager taking to me about why I am not working hard same like before, and you telling him about the superviser position and you did not ask me for it you just give it to someone ealse. Socend, the city manager called me to ask me if I am still interstiing about the postion or not I said yes I am intersting for it. Then he meet me at the work and said to me to get the position you have to do a lot of things before I gave you the position I said a lot of things like what, I am always dowing every thing at work. Third, he said I have to work all the positions in the reastorant the positions are the following:Foodrunner, Host,Selver,and

Ketchen. And after all of that you will get a traning of two other restorants.

Task: Write an essay discussing the benefits of graduating high school after three years as opposed to traditional four year high school and the benefits of pursuing a college education afterwards.","There are some some school's that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some school's that are still doing Traditional way's of the 4 year's of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion It's a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because that's hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometime's stay because they fell behind and sometimes it's because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 year's of high school are the truly advanced one's because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them.

if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some job's just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now they're working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else

In the case that going to college after graduating the three year's are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now they're working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the thing's everyone want's and its good to have a goal in mind.

In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because It's working smarter not harder and that's the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person."," In today's rapidly changing world, graduating high school in three years instead of the traditional four can offer substantial advantages. While completing high school earlier permits an earlier start to college education and the workforce incurring reduced tuition fees, living costs, and competition. Yet, pursuing higher education is vital. A college degree opens up myriads of career opportunities with larger starting salaries compared to those holding just high school degrees. Additionally, a solid education broadens personal horizons and equips individuals with necessary skills to navigate life's constant shifts. While accelerating in high school, graduates are still recommended to consider the long-term potential of higher education and the subsequent benefits."," Title: Accelerated High School Graduation and College Education: A Strategic Advantage

Graduating high school in three years instead of the traditional four offers numerous benefits. Students save on tuition, enter the workforce earlier, and gain a head start on their careers. The economic advantage is significant, allowing students to begin earning wages and reducing student loan debt.

Task: Consider why it is important to be always doing something if you want to accomplish your goals and keep learning new things. Analyze the examples provided and explain why it is important to be actively engaged in life and learning.","In my opinion do we accomplish is if we are doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things.

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish.

Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. For example in your job if you are new you need to learn how you gonna your own work and if you do to want to learn you never gonna be good in what you doing or in the school, when i start go to the High School i was scared because I doesn't spoke English but I started to doing something and now I speak is not the most better English but is work.

In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things. "," Remaining actively engaged in life and learning is essential for personal growth and goal achievement. Constantly learning new skills and knowledge fuels innovation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities. For instance, Albert Einstein discovered the theory of relativity not during quiet hours but while working as a patent examiner and thinking deeply about the subject matter. Likewise, J.K. Rowling persisted in writing her ideas for Harry Potter despite numerous rejections, eventually transforming her ideas into an international literatrure phenomuenon. Staying actively engaged not just in academic pursuits but also in experiences, relationships, and challenges keeps us motivated, adaptable, and ready for the ever-evolving world around us. In conclusion, a proactive approach to life, both personally and intellectually, is vital in staying on the path to personal growth and the accomplishment of one's goals."," Constantly engaging in activities is essential for goal attainment and continuous learning. Idleness can hinder personal growth and stifle creativity. For instance, a student who consistently studies and applies themselves is more likely to excel academically than one who waits for inspiration. Similarly, an entrepreneur who networks tirelessly and innovates consistently stays ahead of competitors. Moreover, active learning is the key to developing new skills and broadening horizons.

Task: Research the job of Robotics, specifically focusing on coding and building components of a robot. Determine the purpose of coding and how it relates to the movement of a robot. Also, investigate how teams of people can work together to build robots and how it is different than individual work. Summarize the findings in an essay.","Did you know that Robotics is the most funnest job than any other jobs out there? what I like to pursue is doing Robotics because it's all about coding and building.

Another reason why Robotics is a job for me to pursue, because it's all about coding. Furthermore, coding is basically you have to type in the words specifically. For example, Forward = (1). That means it tells the robot to move forward only one time. Also, coding is like math, you have to calculate what distance is the Robot is going to do and where it want to stop.

Another reason why Robotics is the one thing that I'd like to pursue is Building. Building the Robot is where you have to work with a team to make it happen, if you were to build it by yourself, it would take a long time to make, since it's only you and not 3 or 4 people helping you. Building is like Lego, but you have to screw in nuts, and not connecting them together like plastic bricks. Also, building the robot is most important, because if you screw something up, you have to remove every part of the robot to fix that one mistake you did.

In conclusion, Robotics is the most joyful job, because it's all about editing and creating a robot to make it function."," Title: Coding and Teamwork in Robotics: Building Intelligent Machines

Robotics is a cutting-edge field fusioning technology and engineering. Coding plays a pivotal role as the primary means for programming a robot's functions. Its purpose is two-fold: guiding the logical sequence of algorithmic tasks (called 'gaining intelligence') and actuating motors and sensors to control movements - known as motor controls and sensor interfacing. Intriguingly, a robot without coding is merely a metal structure; it only starts functioning when a well-written script breathes life into it, enabling complex motoric accomplishments and environmental interaction.

The creation process of robots often necessitates the collaboration between skilled specialists called Team Robotics. Diverse professions such as Engineers, Designers, Coding Analysts, and Mechanical Technicians collectively integrate their expertise to surmount the construction hurdles successfully. In comparison to individual pursuits, the team setup provides advantages including information-sharing, division of labor, feedback loops, cross-functional growth, enabling better performance, cost-efficiency, and competitive edge. In conclusion, robust coding unifies the distinct components of robots with real-world application through Team Robotics. Translating intangible intelligence with meticulously written language is truly remarkable endeavor of wondrous technology."," Title: Collaborative Robotics: Coding & Building Components towards Synergistic Motion

1. Research the socioeconomic environment in Generic_City, with a particular focus on employment prospects, education, government leadership, and general resources available.
2. Analyze the cultural differences between Generic_City and the United States, paying attention to language barriers, economic opportunities, school systems, and recreational activities.
3. Reflect on one's own experience of leaving their home country in pursuit of a better life and the opportunities and obstacles encountered.
4. Compare and","Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day.

Generic_City presents diverse socioeconomic realities. While employment prospects show signs of growth in the tech industry, the labor market largely depends on small and informal sectors, leading to unemployment rates for many. Quality education remains limited with worn-out facilities, overburdened teachers and over-enrollment, especially in lower income areas. Local governments exhibit corruption, leading to inconsistent public services delivery.

Compared to the US, socioeconomic discrepancies widen. language is a key cultural difference: English fluency often limits access to quality education and employment. Yet, Economic opportunities thrive in the diaspora of numerous immigrant hubs, creating unique enterprise opportunities that fuel growth. While the US school system struggles to cater to the needs of diverse cultural populations, the city showcases the beauty of culturally rich traditions preserved through recreational practices, like music festivals.

My own migration experience involved leaving a region with fewer socioeconomic opportunities in the pursuit of prosperity in the US. Encounters with new, often innumerable complex systems and language barriers initially overwhelmed me, though I eventually acclimated to the change and discovered a wealth of resources in new communities. In return, the journey brought with it valuable insights, lessons and connections worth the initial challenges encountered. In comparison with Generic_City, the move represented the discovery of untapped opportunity markets, accessible higher-standard education and responsive local governments - benefits essential to the foundation of long-term growth from my personal perspective."," Title: Adapting to Generic_City: A Comparative Analysis of Socioeconomic Environments and Cultural Differences

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve.

Thomas Jefferson believed that ""idleness…is not more evil than the rigid observance of business,"" challenging society's perception of ""idleness"" as detrimental. In the agrarian context, he advocated that idle moments enrich the mind and spirit while tilling soil, inspiring inventions such as his revolutionary rotating plow. In modern life, short breaks from rigorous tasks stimulate creativity and prevent mental burnout, as in the intervals between productive session and ""incubation periods"" for problem solving. Essentially, a balance between committed labor and respect for idle moments nurtures personal growth and inventive pursuits."," Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""I cannot live without working, and I love to see things prosper under my hand,"" challenges the notion of being idle. Idleness, in this context, is not just an absence of work but a disconnection from productivity and progress. In practical scenarios, idleness can lead to stagnation and lack of growth, both personally and collectively. For instance, in education, being idle during classes can hinder learning and limit academic growth. Economically, idle resources can result in lost opportunities and reduced productivity. Therefore, Jefferson's quote underscores the importance of staying engaged, active, and productive to ensure continuous growth and development.","title: Thomas Jefferson's Philosophy of ""Idleness"": Beyond The lack of activity was not more harmful than the rigid observance of business, and Jefferson believed that idle moments enrich the mind and spirit while tilling land.

Task: Research the potential benefits of creating a homework club and write an essay on why it is beneficial for students.","One way to improve student achievement is to create a homework club. I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time,

less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.

First, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.

Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home i'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. if i joined a club like that i'd be happy because i wouln't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.

Furthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now.

Next, Homework clubs and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. I

believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that.

Finally, I think creating a homework club is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this club.

Task: Examine the benefits of a year-round school for both students and educators. Identify at least two reasons why a year-round school would be beneficial and provide one example to illustrate your points.","I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators.

One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasn't a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies.

Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They won't be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching.

Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching."," title: Year-Round Schools: A Solution for Enhanced Student Learning and Educator Engagement

Many students drop out of school due to external pressures such as economic constraints demanding they work or dealing with family crises, though education's importance lies in securing promising futures (Gottfredson & Bowes, 2003). Parents, as role models and primary supports, play an instrumental part in encouraging sons to continue education instead, enabling them better opportunities in the long term. time management poses significant trials as studies conflict with employment and personal responsibilities (Grossman & McKeen, 2006); neglecting study hours may result in academic failure-a potential pipeline to quitting the educational track (Pew Research Center, 2006). Furthermore, family disturbances may deter students from engaging fully in the classroom (Darling-Hammond et al., 2000); emotional instability may obstruct effective learning processes, creating setbacks for continued schooling. In my experience without consistent family backing, a personal passion project filled the intellectual void during my study hours. Last, the language barrier is daunting for some students (Gillborn, 2000), hindering their ability to effectively communicate, focus in classes, and comprehend course concepts, often leading to abandoning efforts prematurely and perpetuating educational disparity for immigrant students."," Title: The Importance of Educational Perseverance: Overcoming Obstacles with Family Support

Some students fail to complete their education due to financial struggles, family issues, and language barriers. This impedes their future prospects, limiting opportunities and economic mobility. Parents play a crucial role, providing both emotional and financial support, enabling their sons to focus on academics and overcome challenges. Juggling work and study is difficult; time management is vital to maintaining academic success. Family problems can be a significant distraction, affecting concentration in class. Personal experiences without familial support highlight the importance of staying engaged through hobbies, exercise, or volunteer work. Overcoming language barriers necessitates resourcefulness, patience, and the willingness to seek help from friends, teachers, or language tutors.

3. Provide examples of how committing to a career at a young age can help students prepare for their future. 
4. Write an essay discussing how committing to a career at a young age can help students prepare for their future.","Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age it's a good idea.

First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school.

Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that they're the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that it's going to take them somwhere in life.

While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college.

However, waiting until college can be a little late because students aren't going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career they're going to study for. And if they don't, they could pick one that they aren't really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future.

To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. It's a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help.

By exploring resources like career websites, academic journals, and expert interviews, the advantages of deciding on a career path in the formative years become apparent. Committing to a career path provides students an edge through specialized educational plans and the acoustic acquisition of related skills (Examples A and B). Furthermore, a focused direction motivates them to diligently pursues knowledge, aiding them in standing out in the growingly competitive employment landscape. A young career commitment's downsides include the finite appreciation of diverse fields or possible missed ""once in a lifetime” opportunities. Nonetheless, the advantages of early career dedication predominantly tilt the scale towards a more informed, well-prepared person on the path to success (Examples C and D).

Examples A and B: A young mathematician might commit to the path of pursuing mathematics and finance degrees and securing investments banking internships in college, enabling a strong foundation. A young artist could commit to art-centered activities such as developing graphic design skills through web apps and apprenticing at an interior design studio during summers.

Examples C and D: Committing early might prevent exploring multiple fields or taking chances on ""once in a lifetime” jobs, like venturing abroad as a research subject of anthropology, leading to the feeling of missing out (FOMO). Ultimately, although exploration might seem appealing initially, the strategic foresight offered by an early commitment presents future opportunities that would otherwise remain obscured. In conclusion, the trade-off between FOMO from missed diversities and the long-term preparation anchored down by a career path beginning at an early age is something students and educators should weigh carefully and address appropriately through individual considerations, adaptations, and the provision of resources to encourage well-informed early commitment decisions."," Title: Youthful Commitment: Preparing for the Future through Early Career Decisions

Committing to a career at a young age can be a advantages strategy for students preparing for their future. Through focused education and experience, youthful professionals can gain a competitive edge, develop essential skills, and explore their passions (Prosperity for Special Needs, 2020).

These experiences provide foundational knowledge and a clear path to future academic and professional success (Prosperity for Special Needs, 2020).

However, an early career commitment also presents potential challenges. Pressure to decide an irreversible career path at a young age can limit exploration and expose students to potential mistakes (BPS Research Digest, 2018). To mitigate this, students must be encouraged to actively research potential career paths and take opportunities to explore their interests before making definitive decisions. In summary, a youthful career commitment can offer significant advantages in terms of early expertise, foundational skills, and clarity of academic and professional goals. When approached with careful consideration and exploration, a career commitment at a young age can be an empowering foundation for a successful future.","Title: Committing to a Career at a The vejk School of Business: A Strategic Move to the Future By exploring resources like career websites, academic journals and expert interviews, students are provided with an edge in their pursuits by setting out on a path that is specific enough for them.

Adolescence is a critical period of life, filled with peer pressure and new experiences. Implementing a 10 pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is a necessary measure to ensure their safety.

2. Students with anxiety who don't perform well in a classroom. 
3. The benefit of being able to focus without distractions. 
Also, consider the additional benefits of being able to do class work anywhere, including the convenience it brings to an already busy student","Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. That's really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.

My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and won't be distracted by anyone there's a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.

My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.

Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.

My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement.  "," Title: The Value of Virtual Classrooms: A Flexible and Inclusive Learning Environment

Attending classes from home provides students with unprecedented flexibility, especially those who face significant responsibilities. For adults, managing household duties alongside academics can be a challenge. Home-based learning alleviates the need for a lengthy commute while ensuring they don't miss essential information. For instance, a working mom who volunteers as a schoolroom helper or a soldier deploying on temporary assignments can still be an active learner in their virtual classroom (Point 1). Furthermore, the classroom may be an uncomfortable environment for some students dealing with anxiety (Point 2), who perform better and more freely in the privacy of their home (Point 3). Finally, the freedom to access education from anywhere improves convenience for busy schedules and enables students to maintain a focused and uninterrupted study routine (Point 3, Additional benefit). In conclusion, the advantages of attending classes from home address unique challenges students encounter and provide an all-round beneficial educational experience."," Title: The Merits of Virtual Classrooms for Students: Flexibility, Comfort, and Focus

I can fix people if they have any medical problems in life. I was reading books about doctors and I started to get interested becoming one. Being a doctor is alot of hard work, I love doing hard work because hard work makes you pay off. My parents told me don't do something what you think it's fun, do something what you love, what I want to do and love to do in life is to become a doctor.

I sometimes mainly do hard work because of money, one of my main goals is to get alot of money. I need money to buy a house, have children, and taking care of my family. Doctors get alot of money when they do hard work, it's not easy to become one. Hard work makes you feel tired, but at the same time you relax and get alot of money. Money is not important in life, when you have alot of money, the first thing I think about is family first, then I think anything I want on the second thought.

My uncle is a doctor, I learn alot from him how you become a doctor. He told me to read some of the doctor books at this age and then when I get to my senior year, that's when he told me to think about becoming a doctor.

Surgery is not that disgusting when you get used to it, that's why I read alot of surgeon books. When I first thought of surgery, I thought it was really disgusting, but then my uncle told me alot about it, then I stopped the disgusting part. My favorite part about surgery is fixing people, I feel happy that i'm fixing the person. The main reason why I want to become a surgeon is because I want to get alot of money to take care of my family, and I want to help people in life.

First impressions leave profound and enduring impacts, shaping relationships and perceptions in profound ways. People place significance on initial encounters, often influenced by biases, observations, and intuition. For instance, a new colleague who dresses scrupulously professional may be assumed to possess a strong work ethic, despite no documented evidence to prove this. In my personal experience, a friend judged another acquaintance as cold and standoffish due to their aloof behavior. Yet, the latter was a reserved person prone to anxiety around large groups. In either circumstance, the original assumptions stood unyielding. While it can be beneficial to maintain biases, understanding the complexities of human behavior may shift our perspectives. Nonetheless, the feeling or gut reaction is challenging to erase once it etches itself within our memories or cognizance. A skillful ability to navigate, question, and correct initial prejudices is essential for personal growth and harmonious interactions. Yet, altering an impression wholly is, alas, a Sisyphean endeavor."," First impressions hold significant weight in shaping our interactions with others. They are crucial because they often influence our perceptions and judgments about people, leading us to form implicit biases (Ruderman & Fairchild, 2013). Changing these first impressions is an uphill battle, given the strong emotional connection we develop towards them. For instance, consider meeting someone who seems rude or arrogant initially but turns out to be warm and friendly later. The lingering feeling of their initial behavior can be challenging to erase (Gomez & Cooper, 2004). Personally, I have had instances where I formed an unfavorable opinion of someone due to a first impression, only to later discover their kindness and consideration. These instances reaffirmed the power of first impressions and their stubborn staying power, making it a challenge to change them.","Title: The Indelibility of First Impressions First a person’s first impression has profound and lasting effects, shaping the way people think about others.

Task: Outline the advantages of working alone as opposed to working in groups. Explain why you believe it is preferable for students to work alone rather than work in a group.","If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.

Students often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. In my opinion I think it's best for students to work alone then to be working in group.

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student don't need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students.

Example:

A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. The student he's prepared every time for the quiz, and for test.

Finish the school the student is the best student of the year in the school because He passed all the classes and the SOL. During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal.

He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. This student continue that, He pass all the classes, and SOL that He need for graduated. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student.

He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer.

The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes. The parents of this excellent students, and good person, so they feeling fortunate for have a big son.

All we have the opportunity for to be a best person in the life, all depended how we wants to be in the life. Many student wants to have a excellent grade but don't put of they part for be a good students.

Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but don't want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but don't go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing.

We don't know appreciated the best opportunity of the life.

Reasons for graduated in three year

All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place.

why?

because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing.

Are a people responsible!

Why?

because when have a big responsibility never said 'NO' and have care for all thing.

Example:

I'm Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today.

Be carefully!

Why?

because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing.

Example:

My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time.

My Idea!

I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions.

When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. The thing are best when we support all bad thing.

The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they don't want to be a best person in the future.

Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street?

Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street?

Because many mother don't have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing.

Many mother having a bad decisions!

So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life.

Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do!

We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or don't put care to our thing for to be prospered.

Some time is good help take course when the people don't finish the school.

Example:

take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon.

take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity.

take a course for be some body also a little important in the life.

take a course for be a teacher of music.

We have so much course for prepare more when we don't finish the school.

Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students don't finish the school part of this is fault of the parents.

How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated?

The things for to finished the school is:

Go to the school every day.

Make the homework.

Prepared for the quiz or test.

Pass all the SOL.

Pass all the classes.

When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life.

Research the pros and cons of allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom. Consider the effects of wasting class time, potential distractions for students and other students, and benefits such as the use of educational resources or contact with family. Write an essay exploring your opinion on this topic.","I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom.

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

We all must respect people's, teachers', and our time in classroom by not use cell phone to distract and lose the attendances' benefit in classroom."," Title: Cell Phones in the Classroom: A Double-Edged Sword

Allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom is a contentious issue. While cell phones can be a source of distraction and wasting valuable class time, they also offer potential benefits. Wasting time becomes an issue when students use their cell phones inappropriately, for social media, games, or texting. Distractions are a concern when cell phone use interrupts the concentration of students around. However, instructors could use this tool to engage students through educational apps and internet research, enabling a more immersive and informative learning environment. Additionally, emergency situations or communication with family becomes easier with students' accessible cell phone usage, aiding overall safety and well-being. In my opinion, a balance needs to be struck by instructors and admin to minimize negatives while emphasizing the advantages of this technology in the classroom modernity."," Title: The Classroom Debate: Allowing Cell Phones

Task: Write an essay to explain the disadvantages of a four-day school week with two additional hours of school.","To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted four-day work week, with each day consisted of ten hours. Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems.

Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it. These are the reason that makes it a bad idea.

Four-day work week have more disadvantages. To make education and studies wealthy, we should not adopt it because it makes the studies and learning worthless.

A four-day school week with additional hours may initially seem appealing, reducing one day from the traditional five-day schedule while extending learning hours. Yet, there are significant downsides to this arrangement. Extracurricular activities could be compromised as teachers and schools lack resources to cover more programs with fewer school days. Additionally, working families might face increased child care costs if extended hours force them to utilize costly before or after-school services. Lastly, the reduced calendar days might impact crucial learning experiences, field trips, and community activities.

Task: Examine the effects of technology on people in terms of human contact, health, education, and leisure activities. Analyze how the use of technology impacts people positively and negatively. Provide examples of how you have personally used technology. Conclude by discussing if the overall impact of technology on people is positive or negative.","First of all technology has helped people in many ways to do various sort of things when people are in need of something. When technology was first introduced many people didnt know how it could be used to help save lives or help build buldings,schools,malls everything that we have today is because of how benefical technology is to us. The lack of human contact is not using technology too, much its by the person who chooses to use his or hers cellphone, computer and television while technology takes a important positive impact in peoples lives it also helps save peoples lives. For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution.

However people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we can't go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology.

The way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me.             "," Title: Technology's Impact on Humans: A Mixed Bag featuring Human Contact, Health, Education, and Leisure

Technology, both a boon and bane, substantially influences how we communicate, stay healthy, learn, and entertain ourselves. While technology enables us to maintain vast virtual networks, deep relationships can sometimes be compromised due to faceless interaction. For instance, the widespread use of messaging apps can foster illusory friendships, eroding actual emotional bonds.

An unequivocally positive impact emerges regarding health as technology introduces sophisticated telemedicine systems and fitness trackers, enabling seamless consultation, evaluation, and exercise regulation. In education's realm, e-learning and digital libraries grant access to vast knowledge, often transcending traditional constraints with exemplary effectiveness across geographically dispersed areas. Yet, the sedentary lifestyle encouraged via extensive time spent in front of screens may result in negative health issues.

As a responsible student, I endeavor to strike a balance between digital engagements that improve educational experience and regular activities promoting overall physical well-being. For instance, as a participant in an online learning community, I consistently prioritize in-person interactions alongside online learning to maintain optimal mental health and well-rounded social development. In conclusion, the effect of technology on human life is complex, with both facilitative advantages and detrimental risks. Awareness and the conscious adoption of technology to foster positive outcomes while minimizing the negative repercussions can lead to the best user experience overall."," Title: The Ambivalent Impacts of Technology on Humans

Technology reshapes human contact, health, education, and leisure activities. While it enhances connectivity through social media and remote work, it can also isolate individuals (negative). For instance, countless hours spent texting or scrolling through social media may lead to decreased face-to-face interactions.

In terms of health, technology offers numerous benefits (positive), such as fitness apps and telehealth services. However, it can contribute to sedentary lifestyles and exposure to harmful blue light.

Technology revolutionizes education with e-learning and interactive tools but may also distract learners and negatively affect focus and attention. Lastly, while games and streaming services provide endless entertainment, excessive use can lead to addiction and decreased productivity.

Personally, I've used technology to maintain long-distance friendships through social media but acknowledge the importance of setting boundaries to prioritize real-life connections. Similarly, fitness apps have helped improve my health while consciously limiting screen time to preserve mental wellness.

The overall impact of technology is a double-edged sword. Its benefits are significant, but so are its negative consequences. By incorporating healthy habits and setting boundaries, individuals can harness technology's powers for a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.","Title: Technology's Impact on Humans: A Mixed The Effects of Technology on Human Contact, Health, Education and Leisure ",Title: The Ambivalent Impacts of Technology on Technology and Humans ," The effect of technology on human beings: A mixed study relating the effects of technological developments on health, education and leisure.

Task:
Write an essay discussing the pros and cons of students using their phones at school. Compare and contrast using a phone to using computers in the classroom and describe the potential effects of using phones in the classroom. Finally, consider possible solutions for managing phone use at school.","I think for my opinion students should and shouldn't use their phones at school. because the good thing about it is faster and its easier because students now days use their phones every day. The bad things about students using their phones in class its that it could be a distraction for them doing their work and many more things.

The bad things about students using their phones are that students wouldn't pay attention in class and would be lazy to do their work at school, thats why the schools have computers and a library's so we could look up information for their subjects. Its a distraction and wouldn't let them learn or do their work. cause now in these days all teenagers use their phone for everything. Lets say if the teacher let the students use their phone so they can look up information for their work. Im pretty sure mostly of the students would be doing something is like being on social media or texting their friends. Thats why school is a place to get your education by learning and paying attention.

Even students now this days they get mad if the teacher ask for their phone cause they use it allot in class. Students learn more faster by reading n doing their work and using their head. Cause if they use their phone they going to be looking up the answers. I think what should teachers do is that they should give their phone to the teacher once you get into class and once the class ends he should give it to you back. Another bad things about phones is that they use them on the test to look up the answers n dont try.

The good things about using your phones is that it easier to use then a computer and it so much faster. I think students should be allowed cause you could learn from their n look up information or things that you dont understand in class and you could find another way of learning and different ideas. The other good reason your better on typing on phone then using computer.

I think its a good and a bad idea cause with your phone its quicker to use then a computer but the bad thing about its a distraction to student. Cause they would putting more attention to their instead of the teacher. And student get distract with their phone cause they access to social media at the same time. And student would cheating on test cause they would be looking up the answers. Students now in this days have to use their phones less cause they use them every day n not their and thats the reason they dont learn."," Title: Phones in the Classroom: A Double-Edged Sword

Phones, especially if in the hand instead of silent or in airplane mode, pose far greater disruptions compared to the more directed use in front of computers connected to the teacher's lesson (Lasower & Cheng, 2005). In comparison, with computers, the use is generally limited to the classroom and can often require special logins or monitoring, reducing the possibilities of off-task non educational activities.

The possible effects  of students’ use  of smartphones extend beyond distractions as studies show a negative correlation  between phone use  and cognitive performance (Boas et al., 2005)
The result is unfocused minds leading to suboptimal learning outcomes

Effective management strategies include clear classroom polices regarding phone usage, use of classroom management and monitoring software to restrict off-task access when needed. Additionally, incorporating technology in meaningful and relevant classroom activities allow students and educators to harness the educational benefits while limited its potential detractions ."," Title: The Impact of Phone Use versus Computer Use in Classrooms: Pros, Cons, and Solutions

Smartphones have become an integral part of students' lives. In classrooms, their use brings both advantages and disadvantages, contrasting with computers. phones are compact and can be used for multimedia presentations, quick research, and instant communication. However, they can be distracting and detrimental to students' focus and academic performance. In contrast, computers offer more extensive research capabilities and are better suited for complex tasks, like data analysis and programing. However, they require more space and are less portable.

The potential effects on students using phones can range from improved multitasking skills and enhanced communication to decreased engagement, distraction, and lower grades. To manage phone use in classrooms, schools could adopt policies like designating specific times for phone use, implementing monitoring tools to limit distracting apps, or promoting classroom technologies, like interactive whiteboards, to encourage student engagement and academic productivity.","Title: Phones in the Classroom: A Double-Edged The use of smartphones in the classroom provides students with instant access to digital textbooks and research materials, enabling them to learn more interactively and personally than using computers.

Task: Write a persuasive essay discussing why older and younger students should be paired together and how it is beneficial for both students. Include examples in your essay.","I think that older and younger students being together is a really good idea cause that means that the older student can help the younger student and If an older students needs help with something one of the younger students can possibly help. I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. Also the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older. I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because i think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and i just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. And maybe one of the older student can become really good friends with the younger one. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are really good cause students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends. I really think that students are smarter when they are with other students that are not in there age group.

Intergenerational learning - pairing older and younger students - provides mutual benefits. Young learners acquire wisdom and knowledge from seniors, fostering a more nuanced and global perspective. For instance, a fourth-grade student learning from a retirement home volunteer can improve literacy skills enriching their vocabulary with new, less used phrases. In return, older generations offer experience, tutoring young students in specific subjects like algebra or history (my experience with a fourth-graduate). These partnerships generate a positive impact as seniors learn to engage with new technologies. Combining the teachings and lessons gleaned from every generation nurtures an inclusive and dynamic learning community, maximizing the exchange and wealth of knowledge available."," Title: Bridging Generations: The Powerful Benefits of Older-Younger Student Pairings

In today's diverse educational landscape, pairing older and younger students extends far beyond mere age co-mingling. This strategic arrangement fuels remarkable learning experiences, fostering mutual growth and development. Older students share knowledge and skills with younger peers, while younger students ignite curiosity and creativity in their elder counterparts. For instance, a high school student might teach a fourth-grader essential coding skills in a tech lab, while a first-grader could teach a kindergarten peer essential hand-holding skills during recess. Such collaborations build essential life skills, create inclusive environments, and bolster overall academic success.","title: Intergenerational Learning: A Win-Win Proposition Intergenerational The combination of older and younger students, bringing together their wisdoms and knowledge from the elderly, provides mutual benefits.

Task: Analyze the importance of making a good first impression and discuss the impacts it has on a person's life.","I agree with this statement because its hard to change your first impression. If you meet someone and you do something weird theyre gonna remember you as that one weird kid. it can be bad when someone have a bad impression of you when your trying to be their friend. Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you.

if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.

First impressions are sometimes always hard to change if you dont try change it with the people you had a bad impressions with. Sometime they people you had a bad impression of are usually the people you want to be chill with. In life its best to have a good impression because it can help you through life with people you met before. Good impression have a lot of good benefits with your social life. So the next time when you meet someone new its good to have a good impression."," Making a good first impression is vital in today's interconnected world as it often sets the tone for future interactions. A favorable first impression can open doors to opportunities, build trust, and positively impact relationships both personally and professionally. Conversely, a negative impression can limit potential opportunities and damage relationships. Additionally, the ripple effect of making a good first impression carries on, as a positive impression can lead to referrals, endorsements, and increased social and professional influence.

Task:

1. Research the advantages and disadvantages of students attending classes from home.
2. Analyze an example of a student who is attending classes from home and its effects.
3. Consider the times when attending classes from home can be beneficial to students.
4. Explore how attending classes from home can provide more time for students to sleep and stay healthy.
5. Examine how attending classes from home can eliminate the need for students to take the bus or walk.","In some schools think that attend classes at home is most better ;The fifty percent of the schools think that attend classes at home is not productivity. Some people might say that taking classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there ,taking classes at home can benefit students because their can have more time to sleep and their don't need to take a bus or walk.

In the first place ,attend classes at home can't benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there. For example , I have a cousin who take classes at home but he never know anything because no body can help him when he have a question. While, always I tell him that if he have a problem I can help him or another option is that he don't taking classes at home anymore. Also he don't make friends because he do not go to the schools. I choose this option because a lot of student waste their time taking classes at home. I am agree that attend classes at home not have benefit.

likewise, attend classes at home can benefit students because their can sleep more. In my case, if a have the opportunity to take classes at home i'm happy because I love sleep a lot. For example,the twenty-five of the student get classes at home because don't like to make a friends or their believe that their can do the work along. The classes start early so in this way they do not have to wake up early. Also, if people sleep more their can be more healthy this is the reason because student like to take classes at home to be more healthy. I choose this option because is important remember that many students want to sleep more or get extra time because their have a job and is hard to them do two thing at the same time .For this reason many student choose take classes at home.

In addition,attend classes at home can benefit because student don't need to take bus or walk. For example,some student do not have to take bus because are more near to the school. In my case, I have to walk from my home to my schools sixteenth minutes every single day. when winter come and is so cold outside it's not good to walk in this temperature. while , this is the reason because students take classes at home although sometime can't benefit. Another reasons is that some students have to take the public buses so is take classes at home don't have to take bus. I choose this reason because many people forget that many time is not easy for the students do that.

Finally,everything have advantage and disadvantage because some schools think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and some schools are disagree. Also some students work a lot so their can benefit with this opportunity. Although, attend classes at home is not the same thing like go to schools and receive help from teachers, students, etc. In addition, if some schools offer this opportunity have to think about it and look the best option."," Title: Weighing the Advantages and Disadvantages of Home-Based Education: A Case Study on Student X

In high school, I once missed a close friend's important event due to my poor time management. While juggling soccer practice, schoolwork, and friends seemed normal, the day of her art exhibit, I succumbed to the urge for a long- delayed movie night with others. My absence at her event was a disappointment, leading to hurt feelings and missed opportunities for connection over her achievement. In hindsight, had Icommunicated my conflict to my friend and prioritized the exhibit, the disappointment could've been mitigated. After this episode, I realized how important openness and prioritization of relationships can foster stronger bonds that last a lifetime. Sadly, that moment served as a lesson for which the cost was my friend's trust if not her forgiveness."," Title: AFailed Friendship: A Lesson in Accountability

In high school, I failed to support a friend during a crucial moment. Upon learning of her family's unexpected financial hardships, I hesitated to lend a hand due to my own financial constraints. I believed that my inability to help would not make a significant difference. Yet, my inaction led to a fractured friendship as my friend felt abandoned amidst her struggles. Reflecting on the situation, I realized that every act of kindness matters. I could have initiated a fundraiser, offered words of encouragement, or simply reached out to listen. My failure to do so had a ripple effect, negatively impacting her situation and our relationship. This experience instilled in me the importance of empathy, accountability, and taking action when possible.","Title: A Lesson in Friendship and Failure In high school, I missed a friend's important event due to my poor time management.

Task: Write an essay discussing the reasons why students should not be allowed to use cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. Include evidence supporting your argument.","Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school."," Title: Cell Phones as Classroom Distractions: A Hindrance to Educational Success

The permissibility of students utilizing cell phones in the classroom raises concerns due to potential disturbances to the learning environment. Firstly, research indicates students use mobile devices for non-academic tasks, reducing learning focus (RCFA, 2003). Second, the ringing of phones creates audible interruptions (Darling-Hammond & McQueen, 2000), diverting attention and increasing stress. Last, the multifaceted nature of smartphones potentially leads to cyberbullying, compromising the classroom atmosphere (Merchythiong & Akyildiz 2006). Ultimately, the classroom is ideally designed to foster a focused environment conducive to effective learning – the use of cell phones in educational contexts may sabotage that goal."," Title: Disruptive Distractions: Why Cell Phones Should be Banned in the Classroom

Cell phones in classrooms pose significant distractions, hindering students' learning experience. A study published in the Journal of Research on Adult Education reports that cell phone use decreases attention span and affects academic performance. Moreover, constant notifications disrupt the flow of classroom discussions and teacher-student interactions. Additionally, cell phones can be a source of cheating, compromising the integrity of exams. Schools should instill a focus on learning by implementing cell phone bans during educational hours. Students will benefit from a distraction-free environment that maximizes their potential for academic growth.","Title: Cell Phones as Classroom Distractions: A The dangers of cell phones in the classroom raise concerns because they can disrupt learning and reduce focus (RCFA, 2003).

Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

Commit a career at a young age give people the responsability to help their families and support them and with the time people at a young a age get more mature in life ,inorder for people to have a great future in life they should take their own responsabilities and learn from their mistake and with the past of time people learn how important life it's ;while people are gettting more elavate then others peple start to descriminate others who are down don't let people wash your head

,always be you because ,today you are up and tomorrow no body no it don't let appearance cheat on you.

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because that's what they want; don't be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers don't let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mother's have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

While devoting resources to a specific field early on can lead to expertism and financial stability, there are risks. Committing too early might prevent exploring broader interests or adjusting to evolving industries. My personal experience involved choosing a scientific field in high school, leading to a solid foundation. Yet, as technology rapidly advances and research directions shift, adaptability is essential. In planning course selections, a well-rounded education is vital; balancing required core courses and college prep subjects with industry-relevant electives. Making a career commitment impacts not just students but entire families, with significant financial burdens such as tuition fees, reduced flexibility, and the need for potential relocations. Independence is equally affected as a narrow life trajectory can foster a sense of rigidity rather than flexibility. Awareness and preparation, as suggested by exploring multiple options, is of utmost importance when deciding on a long-term career path in the formative high school years."," Title: Young Career Commitment: Pros, Cons, and Personal Reflections

At an early age, making a career commitment can offer benefits such as focus, stability, and financial security. However, it may limit the exploration of diverse opportunities and impede personal growth.

Pros include financial stability through specialization and mastering a specific skill earlier. Cons include missing out on the opportunity to explore other career paths or passions. The emotional impact on both student and family could be significant, especially in terms of pressure and expectations.

Task: Research how failure can be beneficial to becoming successful. Explore various examples such as scientists, students, and entrepreneurs, as well as the use of social media in achieving success. Compare and contrast successes from those who experienced failure along the way with those who achieved success suddenly.","Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. You dont need to fail many times before you get successful.

Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in.

Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles he's failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test.

Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful.

If you ask most successful people of today,some might respond by saying they experienced alot of failure on the way to the top some might respond with a no,this states that failure might plays a role in being successful it may also not play a role in being successful. "," Failure is often seen as a setback on the path to success, but it can in fact be a valuable learning experience. For instance, Albert Einstein did not succeed in developing the theory of general relativity overnight. After years of failure and rejects, he finally found success. Similar experiences can be found among students and entrepreneurs. While some may become instantly successful, others face numerous failures before reaching their goals. For example, J.K. Rowling was rejected by multiple publishers before Harry Potter became a literary sensation. Likewise, the use of social media allows for the sharing of failure stories and the exchange of resources, creating a community of learners. In conclusion, while failure may be unpleasant, it can play an instrumental role in the journey towards achieving our goals, shaping us into stronger and more determined individuals."," Failure, while often viewed negatively, can be a powerful catalyst for success. Scientists like Thomas Edison, who famously stated, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work,"" demonstrate this principle. Students, too, can learn valuable lessons from academic setbacks. Entrepreneurs, like Steve Jobs, whose early ventures failed before Apple's success, prove that failure can pave the way for greater achievements. Social media provides a platform for showcasing and learning from others' failures, offering opportunities for growth and connection. Comparatively, sudden success can lack the resilience and adaptability fostered by overcoming previous failures.","Failure is often seen as a setback The road to success is often paved with failure and rejection, but it can also be an invaluable learning experience.

Task: Examine the pros and cons of taking classes online from the perspective of a student who wishes to pursue higher education.","One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. "," Online classes offer students flexibility, reducing the need for a lengthy commute. Cost savings come from decreasedtransportation expensesand tuition fees often being lower at Online Institutions compared to brick-and-mortar schools. Additionally, the use of technology enables students to access educational resources easily and can accommodate various learning stylesthrough recorded lecturesand self-pacedstudies.However,structuredlearning and personalizedinteractions with instructors and peers may be lessened in the absence of face-to-face instruction. Student motivation and staying on track can be challenges since online learning requires more self-discipline, especially when managing juggling course load with other responsibilities. Lastly, consistent internet connectivity can be a concern. While there are pros and cons, a well-rounded decision based on individual circumstance's, needs, abilities, and goals would be best before committing to taking higher education courses online."," Online classes offer flexibility and convenience, allowing students to learn at their own pace and from anywhere. They also often come with lower tuition costs and a wider range of programs to choose from. However, potential drawbacks include a lack of face-to-face interaction and the need for self-discipline and time management skills. Students may also miss out on the social and experiential aspects of traditional campus life.

Task: 

Research different methods of self-improvement and write an essay that compares improvising versus following a script when trying to be someone. Discussion should include examples and first-hand experiences.","When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time?

Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone else's life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself.

When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself.

You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself.

Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms.

In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way."," Title: Improvising vs. Following a Script: A Comparative Study on Self-Improvement

Improvisation and following a script are two contrasting self-improvement methods. Improvising allows us to navigate life's unexpected challenges by learning from experiences, adapting quickly, and trusting our instincts; an exemplar is acting without a script in improvisational theater or even learning a new skill with minimal guidance. Yet, a script offers a predefined road map and structure to follow for personal growth - like learning a new language with a coursebook or pursuing an established career path based on educational qualifications. Each path provides its unique benefits. While improvisation shapes adaptability and intuition, a script guarantees focus, progress and structure. In my experience, a harmonious combination of both methods ensures a more well-rounded, empowered person who embraces the joys of uncertainty whilst continuing towards personal growth."," Title: Improvisation vs. Following a Script: Navigating the Journey of Self-Improvement

Improvisation and following a script are two contrasting approaches to self-improvement. Improvisation, inspired by comedy and acting, signifies flexibility, experimentation, and being open to the unexpected. It's about learning from experiences and adapting to new situations. For instance, attending a social event without a preconceived plan leads to spontaneous conversations, expanded network, and personal growth.

On the other hand, following a script implicates having a fixed mindset towards growth. It represents structure, planning, and consistency. For example, dedicating oneself to a daily workout routine, learning a new language through a structured course, or mastering a skill through step-by-step instructions.

A successful self-improvement journey combines both improvisation and following a script. Applying the agility of improvisation to navigate the unforeseen aspects while maintaining the structure of a plan results in a well-rounded growth experience. Moreover, embracing the unknown and adapting to it helps individuals stay engaged and committed to their personal development journey.","Title: Improvising vs. Following a Script: A Compared Study of Self-improvement: Improvising and following a script are two different ways to improve self-confidence.

Task: Write an essay discussing how mistakes can lead to a person becoming a better human being. Include evidence to support your argument and a personal experience, if applicable.","Do you believe failure could lead up to a better person? Shortly, I am going to discuss as to why making mistakes is necessary for a person to become a better human being. When a person makes mistake he's/she's is more likely to learn from its mistake. However, not all person learn from their mistakes in the first time, some take longer than others. Therefore, you should always look back at what you did wrong and always fix your mistakes. Making right decisions should help you become a better human being for its future community, country, and even the world.

I personally strongly agree with Churchill's statement. A person should not always be right, some people think that by doing what pleases them they are doing good. However, little do they know they're hurting people because they decide whats good for them and whats not good for them. That leads up to a person who is selfish, mean, and has a cold heart. Mistakes are a problem, and problems can always be fixed.

Once upon a time my friend Generic_Name had a girlfriend, Generic_Name. He was a good kid with a good heart, therefore, that led to people takeover him easily. Generic_Name's girlfriend or friend would always takeover Generic_Name. She would tell him what to do and how to do it, she was the man in the relationship. Thats how good my friend's heart was. She knew she could trust Generic_Name because Generic_Name loved her like he never loved anyone else. Till the day came, sooner than what we expected. The day that he will never forget. It was a Thursday and Me and my friend Generic_Name were on our way to work, I was driving when all of the sudden he starts screaming like if he was having some sort of a seizure. "" NO how could you do this to me"" he said. ""What happened?"" I asked. He tells me that he was on snap chat just chatting and looking at snaps when all of the sudden he sees his ""girlfriend' kissing another man. I tell him to relax and to let it go that she was not worth his time. He calms down, breaks up with her and moves on. Years passed, I noticed that he has changed. He is not the sweet boy with the good heart anymore. He now learned from the mistake he did, which was to let his girlfriend controlled him. He now knows when to say NO and when to say YES. People make mistakes all of the time in their lives. However, that does not mean you cannot change it or fix the mistake you did.

Mistakes are mistakes. You cannot go back in time, but you can move on and make a change in your life. In conclusion, a better person makes a better future for its world. People can change,and we all make mistakes. However, we shall learn for the better.

In Conclusion, I would like to give an advice to all people to never give up. You made a mistake? You all shall learn from it. Fix it. Make of yourself a better self being and be and example for all others. We are not perfect, but we could try or at least act like we can be. Learn from what you did wrong an improve yourself. Love everyone because you only live once in this life."," title: Transforming Imperfections: The Pathways to Personal Growth Through Mistakes

Mistakes, though unpleasant, play an instrumental role in shaping individuals into wiser and more compassionate beings. Thomas J. Watson famously noted, ""If you want to increase your success rates, double your failure rate."" Experiments suggest that people who view errors as lessons for evolution, as opposed to signs of weakness or personal failure, experienced heightened resilience (Dweck, 127).

My own life is a case in point. In my college years, a grade dispute left me devastated. Though disappointing, the experience motivated me to seek academic support, eventually propelling my performance. In my job, a botched presentation was a lesson I needed - I asked critique from my peers to hone public speaking and project preparation skills. For mistakes resemble milestones, leading to personal growth that enriches us both internally and in relationships."," Title: Embracing Imperfections: The Path to Personal Growth through Mistakes

Mistakes are an inevitable part of life, serving as valuable stepping stones towards becoming better human beings. Each error presents an opportunity for learning and self-improvement. For instance, Albert Einstein failed his entrance exam to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, but this setback propelled him to pursue an alternative path that led to his groundbreaking discoveries in physics (Kolb & Kolb, 2010).

Personally, I have experienced the transformative power of mistakes. During my first year at college, I failed an exam due to lack of preparation. I felt disheartened initially; however, I learned from this experience and dedicated myself to improving my study habits. Ultimately, this setback fueled my academic development and enhanced my dedication towards academic success.

Thus, mistakes act as essential tools for personal growth, enabling us to reflect upon our shortcomings and work towards correcting them, shaping us into more resilient and self-aware individuals.","title: Transforming Imperfections: The Pathways to Personal Insight from Mistakes, though unpleasant, play an important role in shaping people into wiser and more compassionate beings.

Task: Research the benefits of online classes and video conferencing for students, and investigate examples of how these methods of instruction have impacted students positively. Consider how students who are unable to get to school due to lack of transportation or other extenuating circumstances may benefit from taking classes at home. Also, explore the ways in which online classes and video conferencing can benefit teens who are victims of bullying, considering topics such as avoiding bullying in the classroom, minimizing distractions, and improving individual learning","I agree that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home. Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.

There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home. "," Title: Online Classes and Video Conferencing: Breaking Geographical and Bullying Barriers in Education

Online classes and video conferencing revolutionize learning by providing educational access regardless of students' geographical or physical constraints. For instance, students living far from schools or lacking transportation enjoy the freedom to learn via the Internet, engendering increased engagement and convenience. Additionally, for teen victims of bullying, online learning provides essential relief; classes held over video conferencing allow them to evade the bully hotspots at school, enabling them to concentrate better and excel. Video conferencing sessions also furnish opportunities to engage with teachers and peers in reduced distraction levels. In conclusion, through fostering greater flexibility, focus, and personalized education—online classes and video conferencing emerge as invaluable methodologies for overcoming the traditional boundary confines in today’s rapidly-transforming world of learning."," Title: The Digital Classroom: Empowering Students through Online Classes and Video Conferencing

    Task: 
    Write an essay discussing the ways in which one's character can be shaped by their own decisions or by life's influences. Include examples of how both can affect a person's character.","Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you can't really pick a side and stay at it , there's good in every bad and there's bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. They're wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that don't care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isn't just about being a good or a bad person , it's about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, that's if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really can't choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but that's not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and life's decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if they're young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isn't the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didn't force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different don't try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different it's more beautiful."," Title: Shaping Our Character: Decisions vs. Life's Influences

Our character is a blend of self-chosen directions and the influences of life. Decisions carve out the path of one's character through intention and personal growth - like a determined artist painstakingly shaping clay (Ghandi, through peace and nonviolence), or a resilient individual rising above hardships (Eminem conquering personal demons). On the contrary, the external forces in the form of environmental factors and chance encounters act like a crafting molder - shaping us unintentionally yet indelibly. For instance, a person can transform under the nurturing presence of family and friends (the warm affect on attachment theory by Erickson), or develop negative characteristics through adverse childhood experiences (the harsh influence leading to the creation of ""toxic"" personalities - Bowlby). Ultimately, character development derives from a harmonious combination of self-chosen directions and the life's shaping influence to lead an engaging and well-rounded path to personal growth."," Title: Shaping Character: Decisions and Life's Influences

Both personal decisions and life's influences significantly shape an individual's character. Decisions, shaped by our values, beliefs, and circumstances, reveal our true selves and build our moral and ethical frameworks. For instance, consistently choosing honesty, even when difficult, solidifies a person's integrity.

Conversely, life's influences, such as upbringing, culture, and experiences, also leave indelible marks on our character. A tough childhood might foster resilience, while unconditional love shapes compassion. The exposure to diverse perspectives can broaden one's mind, instilling curiosity and openness.

Balancing the impacts of our decisions and life's influences requires introspection and adaptability. By recognizing how each influences our character, we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and can cultivate desirable qualities.","Title: Shaping Our Character: Decisions vs. Life's It is a mixture of self-chosen paths and the influences of life.

Task:
Write an essay exploring how difficulty it is to be yourself in a world that refuses to accept differences. Explore philosophical and societal standpoints on why this difficulty is present, as well as what steps an individual can take to overcome it.","Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they don't are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that don't live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you.

Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really don't matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things don't define you like a person and this aspects don't give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you don't have happiness you don't have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they don't want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people don't can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they don't be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are don't be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward.

Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they.

First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself.

Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their life's or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they don't are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy.

Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself.

Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person don't have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that don't have that be equal and that it's fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, don't care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down.

Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that don't accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and don't allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal.

Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive.

Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.      "," Title: The Struggle of Being True: Embracing Differences in a Heterogeneous World

The challenge to remain true to oneself in a diverse yet condemning world incesetibly heightens our existential turmoil (Heidegger, 1953). Philosophically, this confronts the human desire for identity amidst the ongoing need for social connection and conformity (BaumeISTER, 1990). Societally, the reluctance in accepting differences often arises out of fear (LIPTON-SMITH, 1958:79), ignorance (DARLEY & SCHLAFER, 1958:95), or prejudicial norms perpetuated over generations. To combat societal barriers, actively promoting understanding between disparate groups can foster inclusivity (ALLport, 1958:555), whereas practicing self-acceptance (ECKHART TOLLE, 2000) instigates an empowered identity within each differing soul (JAMES, 1890), thus carving a unique road to personal harmony. In conclusion, shimmering like a radiant Gem, the strength of original essence transcends the ever present chasm created through fear or ignorance (PAINE, 2006), reaffirming every individual, though unique, is essential, a captivating diamond aglow."," Title: The Struggle to Be Ourselves in a World of Conformity

Being true to oneself in a world that rejects differences is an arduous journey. Philosophically, this challenge stems from societal pressure to conform, dictating that our worth is contingent on fitting certain norms. Socrates, in Alchemandrus, acknowledged this dilemma, asserting that individuals should strive for self-knowledge, defying the masses or risk losing their authenticity. Societally, biases rooted in fear of the unknown or unwillingness to embrace diversity foster this struggle. Overcoming it requires self-acceptance, seeking communities that honor individuality, and bridging intergroup divides through empathy and education. Ultimately, embracing who we truly are, amid the pressures to conform, is a testament to resilience and authentic living.",Title: The Struggle of Being True: Embracing The Challenge of Keeping True to Oneself in a Diverse and condemning World A challenge for the human being is often felt by those who are not familiar with this world. ,"Title: The Struggle to Be Ourselves in a World that Rejects Differences Being true to oneself in vejk, it is an effort which requires the courage of self-knowledge and defiance of society.

Introduction:
A first impression sets the foundation for all future interactions. In today's rapidly changing world, creating a positive first impression is essential, whether it’s during a job interview, a social gathering, or engaging in business negotiations. In this essay, we explore the significance of making a positive first impression and provide proven techniques to help you master this essential skill.

Body:
The Importance of Making a Positive First Impression: Studies show that people make judgments in the initial moments of meeting someone, with 55% being based on appearances and nonverbal communication [1]. These judgments, both accurate and inaccurate, influence how people perceive, engage, and act towards us [2].

Effective Communication and Active Listening:
Effective communication and active listening are fundamental to leaving a lasting positive impression. Start by seeking common ground with your conversation partner, use a friendly, warm voice maintaining eye contact, ensure that you show a sincere and interested expression [3].

Posture, Appearance, and Personal Grooming:
Nonverbally conveying openness and positive attitude starts with paying attention to first impressions of one’s posture and appearance [3]. Stand tall but relaxed, dress appropriately, ensure proper personal grooming. A good appearance lends confidence, focus, and positivity, putting you at an advantage.

Body Language and Eye Contact:
Body language and nonverbal communication can often influence how powerful a first impression is, as studies show a strong connection between speech content and the use of effective body language and nonverbal communication [3]. Exude confidence, use welcoming handshakes, consistent eye contact, appropriate physical distance further fosters positive interactions.

The Influence of Small Talk:
Small talk plays an integral part in making pleasant conversations that convey warmth and approachability, creating memorable encounters [3]. Master techniques in engaging in meaningful small talk, ask open-ended questions to gather insights, creating connections while keeping interactions fun and light-hearted.

The Power of Positivity:
The human brain carries approximately eight million bits of information each second. Yet we process and act upon merely five pieces of this unfathomable information volume [3].

With light-hearted appropriateness and timing, use funny anecdotes, well-received quips, a well-chosen clever remark delivering an engaging conversation and spreading joy together. A good sense of humor invigorates the human spirit while facilitating the creation of powerful first impressions [3]).

The Power of Smiling:
The human face’s primary expressive feature: the eyes or the mouth? Ample signs indicate it’s the mouth: A smile can go the farthest among expressions towards spreading joyful disposition and positive perceptions around.

The Power of Keeping Calm under Adversity:
Pressure from stress or tension in the workplace, a seemingly impossible misunderstanding, a challenging disagreement: these are moments of internal turmoil that happen to the best of us [3]. Maintaining your presence of calm, particularly in the heat of high emotions, displays your ability to remain in control even in the face of unexpected circumstances while emanating an air of self-assurance.

The Power of Gracious, Patient, and Polite Response:
An interaction filled with graceful and polite manners evokes feelings of respectability towards oneself [3]. These seemingly minute courtesies include the use of ""please"" ""thank-you,"" the addressing of someone using an honorific title in the form of ""Miss,"" ""Mrs."" as a marking of respect. Graciously handling every encounter with kindness and patience helps shape your character leaving a lasting positive impression regardless of the circumstance.

The Influence of Social and Interpersonal Skills for Creating Strong First Impressions after a Negative Mistake.
A negative interaction need not be a death knell for obtaining a positive impression – even a seemingly irredeemable blunder allows for the creation of powerful first impressions [3]. Maintain sincere and honest communication methods to salvage the situation to the best possible effect and always recognize the need for self-awareness when faced with obstacles and challenges to effective interpersonal communication [3].

In conclusion, appearing clean, confident, smiley, and attentive are some essential strategies for making a positive first impression. By consciously focusing on how we present ourselves, we increase the likelihood of leaving a memorable, favorable impression on others.","Title: The Power of First Impressions: Strategies In the modern world, a positive first impression is essential for all future encounters.

"
Task: Write an essay on how problems can benefit people and help them in their lives.","Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Duke's statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes.

Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it.

My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again.

Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know what's the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and don't create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we can't make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life.

My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other. Humans are created to enjoy life and learn from problems to problems."," Title: The Silver Lining of Challenges: how Problems Fuel Personal Growth

Nothing in life is devoid of problems. Yet, contrary to popular belief, adversities can stimulate significant personal growth. Challenges ignite our problem-solving abilities, boost our courage and determination, teach resilience, enhance our decision making skills, and offer opportunities for self-improvement. In overcoming obstacles, we develop inner strength that helps us faced future challenges with a positive attitude. Life’s constant problems not only shape us as individuals, but also drive us towards achieving our full potential. While problems undeniably cause stress and frustration in the moment, the long-term benefits – such as self-reliance, adaptivity, and the invaluable sense of accomplishment upon conquering them – are truly invaluable. Essentially, adversities serve as invaluable learning experiences that fuel growth and empower us for a more rewarding existence."," Problems, though often perceived as hindrances, can be valuable catalysts for personal growth and development. They stimulate creativity and innovation, pushing us to find solutions and improve ourselves. Problems challenge us to learn new skills and broaden our perspectives, ultimately enhancing our abilities to adapt and thrive. Through overcoming difficulties, we gain confidence and resilience, which benefits us in all areas of life. Problems, therefore, should be embraced as opportunities for growth rather than sources of stress or anxiety.","Title: The Silver Lining of Challenges: how The Silver Lining of Challenges - How Problems Fuel Personal Growth Nothing in life is without problems.

Task: Analyze the advantages of inactivity in fostering success. Research how taking a break aids in understanding tests and long hours of work. Compare the benefits of taking mental breaks to not taking breaks. Investigate ways in which entrepreneurs find creative solutions after taking a break. Discuss the importance of taking a break for physical and mental rejuvenation.","Are vacations a necessity to us and to our success? Why do we need them? While some say that inactivity gives us time to reinvent ourselves. Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work.

Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active.

Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing. "," Title: The Power of Inactivity: A Catalyst for Success

A fascinating study reveals the advantages of inactivity, particularly in promoting understanding during intensive study periods and long work hours. Mental breaks enable the mind to absorb information better, as their dissociation facilitates improved retention and problem solving. In comparison, forgoing mental breaks could exacerbate mental exhaustion, leading to erroneous logic or an inability to appreciate innovative perspectives.

Entrepreneurs value this principle. Tesla's Elon Musk is famously known for Taking Intermittent NapKins: his practice consists of short naps followed by a clean slate, often leading to novel insights that fuel his businesses' transformative innovations. In conclusion, the combination of cognitive rejuvenation through mental breaks and physiological restoration through productivity interspersed with leisure is vital. Inactive moments can foster substantial advantages, from promoting understanding to fueling creativity in the dynamic and competitive business landscape."," Inactivity, contrary to popular belief, can foster success by promoting mental clarity and enhancing creativity. Taking breaks from rigorous study or work improves focus and understanding of complex concepts. Entrepreneurs have reported creative solutions following moments of rest, enabling them to overcome challenges with renewed perspectives. The benefits of mental breaks outweigh the drawbacks, as prolonged work without rest increases stress levels and hinders productivity.

Task: Write an essay discussing the role of morals, social class, and people in building character.","I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals.

As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals aren't made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work.

I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character.

In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings. "," Morals act as a foundation for building character, serving as a compass that guides ethical conduct. Social class shapes experiences, shaping moral perspectives. People, with diverse backgrounds, upbringings, and values, constitute a rich tapestry enriching our understanding of ethics. Interactions within social hierarchies allow exploring moral complexities and developing empathy. People, through observing and living various social classes, fuel character development. Morals provide the essence, social class the experience, and the multifaceted nature of modern society presents ample opportunities for characters to evolve and understand its depths, shaping moral character profoundly."," Morals serve as the foundation of character, shaping individuals into compassionate and ethically responsible members of society. Social class, however, can influence the cultivation of moral values and character development. People from lower social classes may face greater challenges in accessing opportunities for moral growth, while those from higher classes have more resources at their disposal. Regardless of social class, people continuously build their characters through moral choices and actions, making it essential to foster an inclusive society that promotes moral education and equitable opportunities for all.","Morals act as a foundation for building a character. Social class shapes the essence of morals, and social class determines how we behave. ","Morals serve as the foundation of character, forming the basis of character.

Task:

1. Research the statement by Ralph Waldo Emerson about individuality and its implications.
2. Analyze how one's own style of work can lead to success.
3. Describe how having freedom of choice when it comes to thinking can help express oneself to the real world.
4. Compare and contrast the difference between being selfish and expressing individuality.
5. Explain how, in the future, individuality could be used to reach different goals.","Do you think individuality create a unique way to be your own of life style? Some say individuality make a specific way to achieve goals being yourself. I'm definitely argue with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement about individuality because your own style of works,Nobody tell us what to change , freely to choose your way of thinking.

First, your own style of works. For example, my dear sister "" Generic_Name"" yesterday, she got a phone call.

I was with her, when she answered the phone call , it's was the teacher saying if my sister "" Generic_Name "" would come at her college, because she was the only one at her class to got a higher score for doing the project with her own creativity and unique steps at the project without following the steps that her teacher being teaching daily at the whole classroom. The teacher told my sister it's a good way to do something with your own ideas without the fear that would be good or bad its just exploring your ability to making great works being yourself .This explain my sister for being the only one to did the project with her own way got the most higher grade.

Second, Nobody tell us what to change. For example,

my sister "" Generic_Name"", every night, she tell me, how I need to brush my hair correctly, she thinks the hair need a proper care and treatment to brushing the hair . I dont like to do at her way because I feel her way to brush it's more slowly than mine own way to brush my hair, so every night she got mad with me because never use her style to brush the hair. I always said to her, I like to brush my hair at my way and my sister can not tell me to change my way at brushing my beautiful hair. This explain, my sister, don't need to get mad for doing the opposite the she wants to do, I got my style and nobody has to tell me what to change at doing any activity.

Third, Freely to choose your way of thinking. for examples. ""Generic_Name "" my sister told to my mom , if she can participate at the "" project of making a novel "" in her school , so my mom let to her participate. She thinks that would be the winner for being the most iconic novel might be existed in the world, so she starting to writing it down, each content at her novel but she dont need a examples of novel because she got her own style to write down, she say her novel would be a entertainment novel because her way to thinks it's different at the other types of novels, her novel will be a her own creativity and passion to make the novel the next most read novel in the world. This explain,free thinking its discovering a new person.

Individuality, makes us special to achieve it goals. style of works different than anyone else. we don't need to someone to tell us what to change. Being free to choosing thoughts it 's s a perfect way to express it with the real world .some says individuality is to be a selfish behavior for doing the things at ours own ways but Individuality it's just a sense of life to find your own way to work. In the future individuality would be the secret tool to reach different goals."," Emerson's declaration of ""Self-Reliance"" champions individuality as a source of strength and personal growth. His essence implores each person to follow their inner voice instead of societal conventions, leading to innovation and success (Emerson, 1841). Each worker brings unique perspectives and methods to the table. Cultivating individual style not only enhances productivity but fuels creative problem-solving (Gleeson, 2006). A freedom to choose thoughts fosters self-awareness and the confidence to translate those thoughts into authentic actions outside of seclusion (Emerson, 1841). Being selfish diverges from expressing individuality, as selfism denotes indiscriminately absorbing resources, whereas personalized creativity adds value to communities. In the future, authentic expression will be essential as industries become globally competitive; the singular insight and ingenuity rooted from embracing one's self will differentiate average from trailblazing accomplishments (Bass, 2006)."," Title: Embracing Individuality: A Key to Success and Self-Expression

Ralph Waldo Emerson's assertion on individuality advocates for self-reliance and unique self-expression. By recognizing and cherishing distinctiveness, one can foster creativity and innovation, leading to success. Our personal working styles, fueled by individuality, offer competitive advantages, enabling us to excel in our respective fields.

Freedom of thought is instrumental in expressing individuality to the real world. It fosters authenticity and open-mindedness. Contrasting self-centeredness and individuality, the former is focused on personal gain, disregarding others, while individuality respects personal freedom and encourages meaningful contribution.

Exploring our individuality could lead to significant advancements in various aspects of society, from innovative technological developments to effective problem-solving, and ultimately, creating a more diverse and enriched world.","Emerson's declaration of ""Self-Reliance"" champions individuality as The individual's independence and freedom of choice are a source of strength and personal growth.

Task: Research the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early from high school, and analyze the responsibilities and benefits of doing so.","Students being able to graduate a year early from high school is excellent choice for any lower clansmen thinking of graduating early in the up coming school year. In the past years lots of high schools have witness a portion of students graduating early due to the students choice in education.

Colleges noticing the students activity is a good thing for them, because they notice how the student is ready to take another step in their life, and willing to put a lot of effort in their tuition as well, just by doing this they could take a lot of consideration in allowing the student to attend their college.

Overall graduating early is a great choice for a high school student looking into this option. All students in every school district, should all have that choice for themselves. If the student makes their choice they should take into consideration that they will need to take a lot of responsibility in completing all task through the year for all core classes taken.

Task: 
1. Research the effects of adding an additional 1.5 hours to the school day on student learning and grades.
2. Find evidence that supports the idea that providing extra time for learning helps students succeed academically.
3. Look at examples of successful educational systems around the world that incorporate longer school days.
4. Analyze a personal anecdote illustrating how student performance is affected when there is not enough time to complete their classwork.
5. Examine the","should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school worker's because they money they get payed will increase.

1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day.

if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teacher's use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teacher's teaching everywhere they went and it's very helpful, for an example they teacher's was like your parent's telling you to do something you don't wanna do they know is good for you but still you don't wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teacher's was like back then in Generic_City, the more hour's we had the more smarter we got . This evidence show's that the more time we got learning with our teacher's the more smarter we got. clearly sometime's the teacher's rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teacher's get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject.

2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day.

perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teacher's because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hour's was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like

1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to '' turn your work in it's time to go '' innocent didn't have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done.

after week's innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teacher's fault so he didn't blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all student's and teacher's.

in addition for student's to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class.

clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect student's grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush.

In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student don't have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they can't and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didn't have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if student's have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the student's. if the school board add one hour and half the student's grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.        ","EXTIT: I researched the impact of adding 1.5 hours to the school day on student achievement. A study by the National Institute for Education Studies in Japan found improved student learning and higher standardized test scores. In Finland's successful educational system, schools have longer days with a strong emphasis on collaborative learning. In my experience, a friend struggled to keep up with homework assignments due to time constraints in the classroom. A longer school day or adjusting homework expectations could help them and others overcome academic challenges. Additionally, the educational systems of South Korea and the Netherlands have higher student achievement despite their longer school days."," Title: The Impact of Extended School Days on Student Academic Success

Extensive research indicates that adding an extra 1.5 hours to the school day significantly enhances student learning and grades. Studies demonstrate that this additional time facilitates in-depth instruction, promotes mastery of complex concepts, and offers opportunities for individualized attention (National Education Association, 2008). Successful educational systems like Finland and South Korea, with their lengthy school days, showcase the correlation between extended instructional time and academic achievement (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2018). Personally, I've witnessed students struggle with completing homework assignments due to lack of time, underscoring the necessity of expanded classroom hours. By investing in longer school days, we equip students with the tools and time they need to succeed academically.","EXTIT: I researched the impact of adding I studied the impact of adding a half hour to the school day on students' learning.

3. Analyse the financial challenges that students can experience when trying to find an education. 
4. Consider the experiences of an older student who has not finished school and is trying to now. 
5. Examine the impact that distance learning can have on students with","I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids.

Task: Write an essay about whether it is good to have someone try to make you change because of the way they perceive your personality.","do you enjoy peolple that is contantly traying to meke you momethimg else?

Some people believe that is good to meke people change because they might like the person but not the person's personality. I'm not agree, becase if someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, they knew how you were and even thought knowing your deffects they decide to be with you, and to love you how ever you are, if they try to change you means thet tey do not leve you the way they say, so is better to get away from them.

If someone loves you they are not going to try to make you change, dont let anybody to make you change, because if they really loves you they need to learn to loves you, and your deffects matter what.

They knew how you were and even thoght knowing your deffects they decide to be with you, and to love you no matter what, just be yourself do not let anybody play with your mind, because all people are going to try to make you change and they are going to even start say bad things about you but you know who you really are.

An involuntary attempt to alter one's personality due to external influence raises various perspectives. While someone's concerns about our behavior or traits may be well-intentioned, forcing change can often backfire, leading to emotional turmoil, miscommunication, and damaged relationships. Alternatively, a sincere and respectful conversation with open ears may result in new self-awareness and personal growth. Yet borders must exist in preserving our core identity – a balance between self improvement and respect for personal autonomy is vital. In conclusion, alterations to better oneself in accordance with one’s own internal drive lead to the healthiest, most authentic transformations."," Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Persuasion: Changing for the Better or Being Manipulated?

I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, that's why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand.

First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things.

I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one don't stay with the same one because there are always there's a lot of things inside of us that we don't want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you don't want to do it.

all people make them own decision but some of them don't know what's them capacity is. Sometimes they don't take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash.

Like the feeling of a person they don't fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they can't feel the love that someone has for them that's the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up.

(Emerson, 1841)

Emerson's explore growth thematically through this profound statement suggest that development results from empowering those around you. A fertile ground is cultivated when one offers assistance – emotionally, intellectually or materially. People grow through nurturing connections – be it as a mentor, a confidant, a friend – or even a casual encounter. Opportunities for personal growth materialize through genuine human engagement. Cultivating empathy, compassion, understanding – not just in words, but also actions – are pivotal in fostering sustainable personal growth for oneself and others. Making connections in relationships can open the door towards continuous improvement in work, character, imagination and intellect ultimately, leading to a more rewarding existence."," Title: Embracing Growth: Insights from Ralph Waldo Emerson

Positivity can help one overcome obstacles by re-framing difficulties into opportunities for growth. For instance, rather than being discouraged by a failure, a person with a positive attitude views it as a stepping stone to success and learns from their mistakes.

Comparatively, a negative attitude can lead to feelings of pessimism, anxiety, and despair, ultimately hindering personal development and success.

Task: Write an essay discussing how one's attitude can affect their success, even if it is negative. Include examples of how both negative and positive attitudes can be beneficial.","A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got.

Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated.

Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it.

Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated.

I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves. Peoples attitudes are what helps people succeed as it should motivate and help make their attitude more positive through the day knowing you did good enough to improve your self. Attitude is much more than just success, its the key to motivation."," Title: The Power of Attitude: A Catalyst for Success

An attitude is a persistent emotion or mental attitude toward a person, object, or situation. Its impact on success cannot be overemphasized, whether positive or negative. A negative attitude may obstruct goals, leading to delayed progress or even failure. For instance, a pessimistic view that ""I'm hopeless at this academic subject"" would dishearten efforts and perpetuate struggle, shielding us from valuable insights, improve and excel. Yet, a negative attitude may also light a motivating fire under individuals when faced with obstacles such as self-imposed deadlines and excelling under pressure, fueling innovation. Likewise, a positive attitude serves a constructive role where an individual is optimistic, motivated, and believes they have the necessary skills to succeed despite obstacles encountered. For example, a person facing a difficult interview might look at it as an opportunity to showcase their talents rather than considering it as a threatening stage for rejection. In conclusion, both negative and positive attitudes play crucial elements, propelling individuals to face challenges differently. Transforming adversity into opportunity is essential and maintaining an open and adaptive mindset, benefiting from all outcomes and lessons."," Title: The Power of Attitude: Turning Obstacles into Opportunities

Attitude plays a pivotal role in determining success, regardless of its positive or negative nature. A negative attitude may initially seem detrimental, but it can breed resilience and determination. For instance, a student diagnosed with dyslexia may view it as an insurmountable obstacle or an opportunity to develop innovative study methods and ultimately excel academically.

On the other hand, a positive attitude can inspire confidence and fuel motivation. An athlete with a confidence-boosting mindset can overcome challenges and emerge victorious. However, an overly optimistic attitude devoid of realism could lead to complacency, hindering potential growth.

On the other hand, negative attitudes, like pessimism, anger, or bitterness, can hinder personal growth and limit success.

Personally, I once held a negative attitude towards a challenging project at work. Instead of embracing it as a learning opportunity, I focused on the difficulties and dreaded every moment spent on it. This mindset affected my motivation, productivity and interactions with colleagues, leading to unnecessary stress and missed opportunities for growth. Through self-reflection and adopting a more positive attitude, I eventually overcame my concerns and not only completed the project successfully but also enhanced my professional development.","Attitude refers to the ongoing evaluations people The way people think about themselves, other beings, objects and situations is a matter of constant evaluation.

Task: 

Explore the pros and cons of graduating high school in three or four years. Consider topics such as free time, elective courses, quality of education, and other life activities. Make an argument in favor of graduating high school in four years.","It is not a good idea for student to graduate in three years because some students don't want to to take classes in the summer because they want to graduate all four years and chose to go to college or chose to go straight into the work force. But some other students chose to take those courses and graduate in three years and take some classes in the summer. It up to them to chose if they want to go to college or go straight into the work and start making money to help themselves.

but I suggest graduating high school in four years is a good idea because students want to spend some time with their families before going into college if they chose or go straight into the working force. So it is not a good idea to graduate high school in three years and take summer or evening classes because it can be too much for you if you work in the summer because you will always be going back and forth from school to work and you will not have time to be with your family and go on vacations with them.

So graduating high school in three years is a bad idea because it will take up all your free time in the summer and you won't be able spend time with family and friends and you won't be able to do all the things you wanted to do after you graduate high school in three years because of all the summer classes and you have to take when you graduate high school in three years. Because when you graduate high school in four years you have all the time in the world if you don't go to college but when you have a job you can take some time of to spend some time with your family and friends.

And also if you go to high school for four years you will be able to take all the elective courses you want and graduate high school in four years and not having to take any summer classes or evening classes and also having the time to spend some time with your family your relative and your friends and also be able to do all the thing you wanted to do before going to college or into the work force. So I think that graduating high school in three years is not a good idea.

There are so many thing to do when you graduate high school in four year like going to the beach sky,diving,go carts,barbecuing with your family and friend and so on and so forth."," Graduating high school in four years offers several advantages. While completing studies sooner means more free time for various life activities, the increased pressure to meet deadlines may negatively impact the educational experience. A longer academic tenure permits a more in-depth exploration of desired elective courses and the freedom to engage in extracurricular activities. Additionally, a more substantial education prepares students more robustly for the complex, continually evolving world they will face in college or the workforce. In conclusion, the advantages of gaining a more substantial education and the freedom to engage in enriching activities during the formative high school years outweigh the appeal of an accelerated graduation path. opting for a fourth year might thus prove worthwhile for personal, academic, and long-term growth."," Title: The Four-Year High School Journey: A Balanced Perspective

In contrast, a four-year high school tenure offers a more balanced educational experience. It allows students to delve deeper into their interests through elective courses, engage in sports or clubs, and enjoy a more relaxed college application process. Quality education thrives when students can absorb knowledge, grow, and truly prepare for the future.

Task: Research why setting the aim low can help in overcoming one's dreams and building character. Evaluate the risk in setting the aim high versus setting the aim low, and consider a scenario in which a person challenges themselves by taking risks. Explore the idea of taking steps to work towards achieving a goal instead of thinking large leaps will get one to the top. Provide your opinion on how people should consider thinking before doing anything.","Some people may say that oppocite but to start with your aim low helps with the little mistakes that need to be fixed.

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff.

The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aim's low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fix without putting any effort or even think about it for a second,people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieven their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

Setting the aims at a low risk help with not losing what it was to hard to get or to achieve,by understanding that thats what help getting far in life and not let anything fall short and just taking the time to think and overview that things that are still around and star making them better and just work on them step by step. As some may say that its good for people to chalenge themself once in a while but without risking whats around it because whats the point of being able to work so hard and by just one step that was taking without having a chance to think of what was happening and lose it all by not taking it step by step.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it."," Setting ambitious goals can be inspiring, but the pressure to succeed can sometimes beparalyzing. Setting smaller goals, or aiming low, offers several advantages.Firstly, reaching smaller goals builds self-confidenceand character through persistent effortsand small wins. Secondly, the risks associated with setting high goals,such as disappointments and setbacks, can be minimized by starting smaller. A person can challenge themselves by progressively increasing the scope and complexity of their goals, thus limiting potential harm and developing resilience.

Though the potential rewards of high aims may be significant, the risks of failure or disappointment can hinder progress.

6. Determine the importance and","Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, ""Success isn't around the corner. You'll have to work as hard as you can until you reached your limits. Always trying new things will make you grow."" Life can be great, if you know how to make the best out of it. Although, it may seem that trying is hard and it's a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals.

Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, they're hard, but that doesn't stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win.

I used to be 275 pounds, I wasn't happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try.

I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall.

Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but it's a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything. My grandpa told me that trying is your best buddy. It can make you push yourself and it can take you places you've never seen in your life. "," Ralph Waldo Emerson, a 19th-century philosopher and poet, is famously quoted as saying, ""What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us"". Reflecting on this profound statement, Emerson's words ignited my desire for personal growth and introspection. In my life, the relentless push to try new experiences led me to succeed in overcoming a fear of public speaking. Though the initial attempts brought nervous fumbles, the journey towards improvement was essential. Through this process, I developed important skills that broadened my horizons and forever positively impacted my self-confidence. Emerson's words remind us that the struggles and accomplishments in life pale in comparison to the limitless potential residing within each person."," Ralph Waldo Emerson, a transcendentalist philosopher and poet, championed self-reliance and individualism.

Through determination and perseverance, I completed the manuscript, overcame self-doubt, and submitted it for publication.

Online courses enable students to learn from anywhere, reducing the need for commuting time and expenses (financial advantage). However, a key concern is limited social interaction (con: isolation) although various digital tools facilitate communication between students (mitigating factor). Online courses offer self-paced studies and a wide array of courses (activities). In comparison, traditional classes deliver structured routines with access to resources like career services or student associations which might broaden one’s horizon (financial trade-off; opportunity for extra-curricular involvement).

Schools have a pivotal role in fostering sustainable practices, particularly in the realm of energy and resource conservation. Five approaches to minimize impacts, benefiting both schools' bottom line and the planet, are as follows:

2. Encourage the walk-to-school campaign for short trips. Or, install bike racks to incentive bicycle use in lieu of motorized transportation.

3. In place of disposable supplies such as ziplock bags, promote zero-waste school stores. Additionally, schools can invest in the use of reusable dishes, serving trays, and washing stations.

4. Involve students and educate them on energy-saving practices, both within a school day curriculum and extracurricular events. For instance, a ‘green’ team can initiate a composting station on campus or even organize various educational sessions.

5. Last, schools planning to renovate, build a new wing, install a new heating, and/ or a cooling systems can look to utilize biomass energy options, like geothermal heat pumps.

Task: 

Write an essay examining why praising students is more effective in building true self-esteem than achievement. Use examples to illustrate your point.","some people believe that true self esteem com from achievement, I

think that they are wroung, i think that self esteem come from praising student.

people that believe that true self esteem come from praissing student work are think that they are right.

like for example;

if the student want to learn and and they are trying to do what you ask that to do and they died not do it the right way and you tell than that is not bad and you keep encorraging than to keep trying, it will give than the cinfident to do more work because they know that they are doing something good,

but if they are workung hard and you keep telling than that they are dum or telling than that they are not doing it the right way they will get tire and will not have the energy to work anymore.

people that prais student are people who want to show the student that they can do any thing that they want to do in life, I belive that many student will be able to do well in school if only the teachre can make than to know that they are spical like every one of the student in the class or school, there are many student out there that want to learn but they just need someone who will be able to encorrage than that they should trust in that self and tell than that they can do it. "," Title: Praise and Self-Esteem: Building Blocks of True Confidence

Effective self-esteem stems not just from accomplishments, but the encouragement and recognition of efforts. While achieving goals is essential, praise encourages children to persevere through obstacles and embrace future challenges. For instance, complimentinga child's resiliencein learning a new skill instills an inner sense of value and capability. Likewise, expressing appreciation for a struggling student's determined attitude encourages persistence rather than discouragement following failure. In contrast, over-reliance on resultscan foster a fixation on success at the expense of emotional health, leading to anxiety, stress, or even underperformance. Praise fosters true self-esteem; it acknowledges effort equally alongside achievement."," Title: Praising Students for Self-Worth: Beyond Achievements

Praising students for their accomplishments is customary as it reinforces hard work and dedication. However, focusing solely on achievements may fall short in building authentic self-esteem. Praise bolstering non-academic qualities, such as kind-heartedness or resilience, fosters a sense of self-worth that extends beyond grades (Example: A student who consistently shows empathy to peers is commended for their caring nature). This type of recognition validates a student's inherent value and develops emotional intelligence. By incorporating praise for qualities distinct from achievements, educators instill a deeper, sustainable sense of self-esteem. This approach not only enhances a student's confidence in themselves as individuals but also creates a more holistic learning environment.",Title: Praise and Self-Esteem: Building Blocks of The Building Blocks of True Confidence ,"Title: Praising Students for Self-Worth: Beyond Achievements The term “achievement” is usually used to describe the hard work and dedication that students have put into their studies.

Task: Explore the benefits of imagination over knowledge in making life decisions. Consider: How can imagination help us choose the right thing to do? What kind of pressure does knowledge create? How can knowledge affect the future? How can imagination help us succeed in college?",I agree that imagination is more inportant than kowledge beacus in imagination I feel like you learn more about your brain and that will help you a lot knowledge you really dont learn anything you just learn how to other people choose what you like. Imagination you can think about what to choose like if there is a car you like imagen if you didint choose the other one that one is going to the dumster if was one good car and one ugly car but if it was knowledge you will have pressure. You will not know what to pick or you will know what to pick if you use your imagination. Knowledge you really have to decide what you want but imagination you just can imagen like what are you going to need that in your life like if you had to choose a house or a car what will you need more in life thats why you use your imagination so i rather pick a house beacus you will need that house when you grow up like for your kids. knowledge i feel its bad for you in the futcher.

Task: Research the benefits of extending the school day to 10 hours in order to provide students with enough time to do their homework and get enough sleep. Evaluate the impact this would have on energy, water, and other resources. Analyze how this would affect students and teachers, both positively and negatively. Discuss if schools should only have four days a week with 10 hours per day, or should they maintain five days a week with 8 hours a day.","i think working 10 hours a day is way better then working 8 hours a day you can save alot of energy and electrricity and your time in a day. in 4 days working 10 hours a days is like 40 hours a week. still if you want to do overtime you can still do overtime on friday and saturdays.

working 10 am to 10 pm is better then working 8am to 4 pm. i think my school should change the school hours and save some time. they should extrend the school hours to 2 hours so that the kids can get enough sleep when they go home and they can do there work at the jobs too. if my school extends the school hours to 2 more hours then kids can get off for 3 days from school. that's how schools can save alot of energy water etc. teachers can get 3 days a week off too if my school extedns 2 more hours and make it to 10 hours. there should be just 4 days school in a week. some people have hard time to wake up early in morning so they can do there homework. when students get enough sleep they can focus more in there studies and they get more time during weekends too do there homewoks. that's how students can achieve there goals in high school when they get enough sleep they can stay more fresh and active during school hours. in high schools most of the students have hard time during the whole school year just because they do not get enough time to do there homeworks during the weekends most of the students work 32 to 38 hours a day so they do not get enough time to do there homeworks on saturday and sundays."," Title: The ImpACT of Extension: A School Day Revised

Extending the school day to ten hours might seem a promising solution to help students complete homework and ensure adequate sleep. Yet, the environmental and societal implications call for a more nuanced conversation. A longerday means more energy consumption and resource-intensive facilities. Yet, reducing the number of school days weekly would mitigate such burden and might benefit energy conservation. For teachers and students, the longerday might boost effectiveness: higher-yielding lessons and ample preparation time for teachers; fewer nights of late workloads for students.However, loss of weekends may negatively impact work-life balance. A debate exists regarding preferred schedules. Modifications to infrastructure, resources, student and educator time management, as well as community support are paramount. A comprehensive assessment should be taken into account to determine what might work best with a careful weighing of advantages and challenges: the long-standing debate between length of week versus length of day for the greater education benefit."," Title: Extending the School Day: A Sustainable Solution for Education and Well-being?

Extending the school day to ten hours could benefit students by providing ample time for homework completion and ensuring adequate sleep. This reduction in homework time outside school hours reduces energy consumption for lighting and heating homes. However, the increased water usage for longer showers and dishwashing may offset these gains. The extended day could positively impact students, allowing for more focused learning and reducing pressure to excel within the traditional schedule. Teachers may face increased workloads, but could benefit from more planning time. A four-day week could save resources, but may negatively impact the rhythm of learning and work-life balance.

Task: Explain why it is important to use your imagination rather than just knowledge. Include examples to illustrate your points.","Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination,

you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it's. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it's going to look like. In knowledge you just know it you can't make it more beautiful. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. That's why imagination is more important than knowledge.

Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you can't build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. In knowledge it's like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question.

Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. If we don't use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you're making your life better and the world a better place.

To conclude, scientist Albert Einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. If you can imagine something than you do it if you imagined it right. "," Imagination and knowledge are integral parts of human cognition; however, the importance of imagination cannot be overstated as it fuels innovation and problem solving. While knowledge gives us facts and info, imagination enables us to innovate, envision solutions, and see beyond the literal limits. For instance, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity didn't solely rely on his existing knowledge, but he used imagination and curiosity to question why things move and revolutionized the scientific world. Likewise, J.K Rowling created an elaborate world full of magic through her imagination which became the basis of her popular series, Harry Potter.

Task: 

1. Research the life of Winston Churchill and the quote attributed to him
2. Reflect on the concept of failure and if it is necessary to achieve success
3. Explore reasons for and against losing enthusiasm after failing multiple times
4. Create an example scenario to illustrate how someone can be successful despite failure
5. Construct an argument to support not losing enthusiasm after failing multiple times
6. Write an essay on the importance of being consistent and not giving up after failure","Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. As the British Prime

Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.

Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn't have done before, is a way to waste time because, you're not going to complete it anyways. They also believe that it's really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don't achieve success.

One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn't pass it as well. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn't pass it again, he felt stressful ""what's going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. As result he passed the test with a good score. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. If Generic_Name hadn't been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn't have passed the text. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.

Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. As example of this is my self. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. But it wasn't that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. In that point I wasn's really sure if I wanted to continue with that. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn't pass it at the first time. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. Now I have a car and my driver's license even though I was hard to make it. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don't give to get success. If I hadn't been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn't have gotten my driver license. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.

In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill's statement, and I'm agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it's a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent.         "," Title: Triumph Through Trials: Winston Churchill's Wisdom and the Power of Unwavering Persistence

Winston Churchill, a celebrated Britishstatesman and author, famously acknowledged, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" Reflecting on his sage quote, we must ponder if failures strengthen our character or discourage our enthusiasm for the journey ahead. While the initial setback might dishearten us, multiple failures may erode motivation and fuel the belief in the futility of pursuing aspirations. Yet, through his leadership duringWorld War II, Churchill embodies triumph over adversity, remindingus that persistent efforts yield fruit when one faithfully navigates the path to success. For instance, a struggling artist who experiences numerous gallery rejections but persists can eventually gain recognition through tenacity, eventually becoming a household name. Losing enthusiasm amid failures may be a pitfall, but the critical argument is, the longer we cling on, the subsequent successes eclipsing our initial setbacks prove worth the journey.Thus, the essence of consistency liesin continuing amid challenges to reclaim victories even in the aftermath ofapparent failure. In conclusion, the life lessons infusedin Churchill'sbeloved quote should be a touchstone in the journey towardsanygoals. After experiencing a series of failuresthat threatened my purpose, Winston Churchill'swordsnot merely inspired belief in thepossibilityof resurrection,butinstilledinme thecourage topush forth andcontinue my pursuing aspirations, persisteningamely througheachsetback, knowing that continuous determination and unyielding belief in the journey itself will one day bring reward.By demonstrating an unfaltering passion, eventually the impossible becomes attainable when one faces every new trial with a resolute desire and never lets adversity obscure the long-gaze vision as a persistent pilgrimage for the path to victory finally manifests. Maintaining consistency persistently chiseling the journey towardsachivements, eventually the impossible becomes attainable when one faces every new trial with a resolute desire and never lets adversity obscure the long-gazevision.

Title: Overcoming Failure: Lessons from Winston Churchill

Winston Churchill, a renowned statesman and author, famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" Churchill's life, marked by frequent political setbacks and personal struggles, underscores this statement.

Failure is an integral part of success, pushing us to learn and grow. Giving up after repeated failures, however, can rob us of valuable experiences and opportunities. Fear of failure often stems from the fear of judgment, but persistence pays off.

Consider an entrepreneur who faces numerous rejections before landing a business deal. Despite the initial setbacks, their resilience and passion drive them to refine their product and approach, ultimately leading to a successful venture.

In conclusion, consistent effort and refusal to let failures extinguish our enthusiasm lead to long-term growth and success. Embrace failure as a valuable learning experience, maintain a positive mindset, and never give up on your dreams.","Title: Triumph Through Trials: Winston Churchill's Wisdom The Power of Unwavering Persistence Winston Churchill, a celebrated British statesman and author, famously said: ""Success is not final, failure is never fatal.

    Task: Research the importance of being responsible and hard-working in a job. Investigate the experience of being a young employee, and researching through examples of people who achieved their goals and worked hard. Examine why leaving an excellent record in a job is important, and the role that experience has when an individual applies for a job. Evaluate the potential consequence of not following rules. Explain why it is worth to work hard and be responsible in a job.","Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to ""

The Washington Post,

"" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important.

The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Name's goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 o'clock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job.

The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in

Village's Company

. He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Village's Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Village's Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs.

In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs."," Title: The Value of Hard Work and Responsibility in the workplace: A Path toSuccess and Personal Growth

Being a responsible and hardworking employee is essential as it sets the foundation for a successful career path, from entry-level jobs to leadingpositions. Young employees who exhibit these qualities gain valuable experience, build stronger teams, and earn trust and respect from employers and peers. A notable example of this trait in action is Steve Jobs, Apple Co-founder. His dedication and passion brought the tech industry to its feet with Apple products' innovations. A pristine work record is vital, as employers prefer individuals with a proven track record. Experience gained during this tenure equips one with necessary skills to succeed when job seeking. Disregard of rules may result in dismissals, lost trust, reduced productivity, and reputational harm, cementing an unfavorable career trajectory. Working hard and responsibly reaps numerous rewards- career advancement, valuable network connections, and personal growth -making the journey worthwhile."," Being a responsible and hard-working young employee is crucial in today's competitive job market. Working diligently builds a solid foundation for future professional success. For instance, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, started his career at Hewlett-Packard as a technician. His dedication and innovative spirit led him to create groundbreaking products, transforming the tech industry.

Leaving an excellent record in a job is vital since it enhances a person's reputation and increases their employability. Prospective employers value experience and responsibility over inexperience. Not following rules can result in disciplinary actions, loss of trust, and damage to one's professional standing. Thus, the short-term benefits of slacking off may not justify the long-term consequences.

Task: Consider the pros and cons of selecting a career at a young age. Analyze the opinion of individuals who have chosen a career in their youth versus those who wait until later in life. Use examples from your own experience or research to support your views.","Do you think it is a good idea for the students to commit to a career at youg age? That is a good idea because the school will give the opportunity to know more things. Also, is a bad idea because some students have a lot of things to do after school, they have responsabilities example; they have to work, they have to do things in their house, or many things what a young can do. I choose students have to take the career at a young age because:

They will be ready when they have to work in that career, if they going to take the careers that they prefer it is going to be good, because they will practice and they will learn a lot in of that ,so they will focuse everyday in that career. The most important is they won't have any problems when they have to show everything what they learn after they did finish their career.

It is a good idea because is not bad that in some societies the students has to expected to identify a career by the hight school, because about that form the people can know what is his/her specialty, or what work realized in the high school ,if that person was good or bad in that career.

Is good that person know what he/she wants to be in the future, because some people don't know what they want to be, what is their dreams when they become adult ,but some people know what they want to be ,and what is their dream job. Is very important to know that you want to be sure about your future because this opportunities are not in every where we have to exploit the things the life give us, because when I was a little girl my dad alwas plead me that I enter a couses like English, computation,to play guitar, dance, and many things ,but I always respond no ,because I just wanted to play and that set , but now I know the importance to learn ,to know ,to make something ,and show to the world that you know that you can do that ,and nonthing in this world is impossible.

They will have the capacity to learn more things about the careers what they will going to choose. Also, the school will give them the opportunity to work in the summer or after school, this idea is amazing because in others countries like my country there are not career to choose in the schools ,the student are not ready or they are not ability to work in something because they don't practice nothing in the shool they don't know anything .They just study and don't have elective courses that ways, the student in my country don't work usualy the parent are who work.

The conclution is that the students have to take some career ,bacause is very important for the societies also for them, they will be capacity to know many things. Also, they will be ready to make the work what they choose in the hight school. And the student won't have complication or doubt to may complete their job. Finaly, the students will have a profession in something that they can make very well, but this courses is not just to show to the others persons the career that you took in the high school. This career is for you ,for your future more forward. What happen if you can process with your study, this courses is an advantage in your live. You can take out a benefit to this oppportunity."," title: Seizing Opportunities Young: A Career Dilemma

Deciding on a career path at a young age presents pros and cons. For some, like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, the advantages can include focused education and long-term dedication. Yet, waiting until later permits exploration of diverse fields. Opinions vary. Young career- choosers, driven by passion, often face lesser competition. For example, Jobs dropout status led IBM to offer him a lucrative contract despite not completing his degree. Yet, waiting allows for personal growth - like skills acquisition or maturity as in Delay's case. Ultimately, the timeline for career- selection does not ensure its potential success but the individual's resolve does, as shown by both groups. In my experience interning early granted industry insight and let me make informed future college majors and career aspirations. Yet, a friend waitted until college, discovered a new passion, thus altering midstream plans resulting in potential opportunities that wouldn't have been found previously. A young career path provides opportunities but so can a later one, thus research or personal reflection is essential prior to any decision."," Title: Young Versus Late Career Choices: Pros, Cons, and Personal Experiences

Selecting a career at a young age offers the advantage of early specialization and focused education. Individuals who choose a career path early, such as physicians or engineers, may benefit from years of focused training and a clear sense of direction. However, this approach also carries risks, as personal growth and life experiences may shift career interests.

Conversely, waiting to choose a career later in life can lead to broader educational experiences and personal development. For example, individuals who travel or work various jobs before settling on a career may gain valuable life skills and a more informed perspective on their future profession. However, this approach can also delay financial stability and the accumulation of professional experience.

My own experience aligns with those who pursued a late career path. I started my career in a different field and later switched to a more aligned passion. Though this path was less financially stable initially, I have gained valuable life experiences and found greater fulfillment in my professional life.

In conclusion, both early and late career choices have their pros and cons. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual circumstances, career goals, and personal values.","title: Seizing Opportunities Young: A Career Dilemma The decision to pursue a career at an early age has its advantages and disadvantages.

Task: Research the effects of oil on health and in how it can affect students' performance in school. Also, research why some people believe that school cafeterias should not change their food and the reasons why others believe that school cafeterias should change their food.","Do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that's what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the school's cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school's cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick.

Those who think that the school's cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn't eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can't think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesn't sound that bad, isn't? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it.

There are many people who think that the school's cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don't know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History.

Another reason to change the cafeteria's food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don't know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don't like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school.

In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria's food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who don't like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who don't want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"". I think that the reasons to change the food are more productive for the improvement of our school.             "," Title: Oil, Health, and School Cafeterias: Impacts on Students

Oil consumption has been linked to various health issues including heart diseases, respiratory problems, and obesity (Harvard School of Public Health, 2021). Exposure to frying oil fumes contain harmful pollutants like Acrylamide and Trans-fat which negatively affect the cardiovascular system (Gillies, 2005). These issues could prevent students from performing optimally in school, as their attendance and cognitive abilities could be affected. While changing cafeteria food could seem a difficult task for some, the increasing awareness around health issues demands transformations. Those in favor believe in the provision of healthier, fresher lunches, reducing students’ intake of oil and processed foods. In comparison, opponents emphasize on maintaining consistency, avoiding inconvenience to students and schools. A hybrid approach - gradual integration of healthier menu options, preserving tradition while improving overall nutritional value – might cater to the needs of all involved."," Title: The Impact of Oil Consumption on Health and School Performance, and the Debate over School Cafeteria Food

Oil, whether consumed in food or used for heating, has significant effects on health and school performance. Excessive intake of oil-rich foods can lead to obesity, heart disease, and cognitive decline, adversely impacting students' academic performance (Healthline, 2021). 

Simultaneously, the debate centers on whether school cafeterias should maintain or alter their menus. According to some, traditional menus preserve cultural heritage and promote familiarity among students, while others argue for change to introduce healthier meals. This discourse reflects the importance of addressing health concerns and the influence of diet on student performance (The Conversation, 2019).

In just under 100 words: Oil consumption affects health and school performance, with prolonged exposure to unhealthy oil-laden foods potentially leading to obesity, heart disease, and impaired cognitive function. A contentious debate surrounds the need for school cafeterias to adapt their menus - while preserving cultural dishes provides comfort and familiarity for students, advocates for change propose these shifts to improve overall student health and academic performance.","Title: Oil, Health, and School Cafeterias: Impacts The Effects of Oil on Students’ Health and Well-being ","Title: The Impact of Oil Consumption on The Effects of Oil on Health and School Performance, ", The effect of oil on the health and well-being of schoolchildren. , The effect of oil consumption on health and school performance. , The effect of oil on the health and well-being of schoolchildren. , The effect of oil consumption on health and school performance.

Task: 

1. Research the reasons why elderly people like to go outside 
2. Find out which types of games were popular in the 1800s and how they are still played today
3. Investigate the advantages of playing games such as hopscotch and tag
4. Compare the physical, mental and social benefits of these games
5. Describe which type of personalities are attracted to each game","What is your favorite thing to do during your free time? Do you stay in bed and watch movies? Do you go to your community library to read books and study? Or do you just go outside for a walk?

Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside.

Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isn't a really competitive game and can be played alone, it's better when its played with other people.

Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isn't usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids.

Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park."," Title: Elderly Exuberance and Timeless Traditions: Exploring the Delight of Outdoor Games

The appeal of outdoor games among seniors arises from various reasons. Primarily, the fresh air rejuvenates them, boosts Vitamin D levels, and offers a sense of nostalgia, engendering joyous memories (reason one). In the 1800s, the immensely popular 'skipping ropes' and 'stoolball,' a forerunner of cricket, gave entertainment and community bonding. Hopscotch and tag, both still played today, engender flexibility, agility, and provide moments of laughter (advantage one). These games present myriad benefits – fostering mental acuity by requiring attention and strategy, boosting physical health, and creating social networks – unifying generations through joyful experiences (advantages two to five). Personality types attracted to hopscotch are usually more methodical and meticulous, metering their movements carefully; while tag captivates the spontaneous spirits, eager for the rush and frisson of excitement. Intriguingly, the boundary-defying joys of outdoor games transcend age, cementing intergenerational bonding."," Title: Elderly Outdoor Activities and Timeless Games: Hopscotch, Tag, and Intergenerational Connections

Elderly people crave the outdoors for numerous reasons, including socialization, fresh air, and reminiscing memories. In the 1800s, popular games like hopscotch and tag provided mental, physical, and social benefits, with both games remaining prevalent today. Hopscotch, an intricate game of strategy requiring focus and precision, has enduring appeal for diligent and patient personalities. While tag, a high-energy chasing game, continues to entertain adventurous and social individuals. The timeless charm of these games bridges generations, delivering intergenerational bonding, improved cognitive function, enhanced coordination, and fostering an active lifestyle.","Title: Elderly Exuberance and Timeless Traditions: Exploring Among Seniors, the appeal of outdoor games is obvious: fresh air rejuvenates them, vitamin D levels are increased, and nostalgia brings back fond memories.

Task: Compare the benefits of working in a group with the benefits of working alone, using examples to illustrate your point.","Have you ever wondered about your working skills do you prefer working in groups or on your own? How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else?

people say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides.

I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had sometime to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do and we finished it during class.

Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addtion you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it.

In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. Their is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas. You get to express thoughts and feelings about your topic. So many more things that working alone doesn't give.    "," Working in a group can foster creativity through the exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives. For instance, a team designing a product might combine individual strengths to innovate, leading to unique solutions. Group collaboration also instills a sense of camaraderie and mutual accountability.However, working alone offers distinct advantages. One can focus fully without external interruptions or distractions, leading to heightened productivity, as in the case of Steven King, famous for writing in quiet, secluded spaces. In conclusion, both approaches serve unique purposes in the realm of productivity, with group work leveraging synergy and collaboration, and solo endeavors maximizing concentration and uninterrupted flow."," Working in a group and working alone each offer unique benefits.

Task: Compare and contrast the benefits of working in a group and working alone.","Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group.

When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster.

Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily.

In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas.

Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster.

In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own. "," Working in a group encourages collaboration, idea-sharing, and problem-solving through collective intelligence. Each member brings unique perspectives and skills to the table, leading to innovate solutions. Group work also fosters team building and improves communication skills. In contrast, working alone offers the freedom to focusing purely on individual strengths and preferred work styles, leading to maximum productivity and personal growth.

Task:
- Identify two personal experiences where failure was not an obstacle to success. 
- Describe the impact of Winston Churchill's statement on your view of failure.
- Discuss a time when someone else gave up quickly and how it affected you.
- Explain how some people maintain enthusiasm for success even after failure.","Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm.

I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasn't good at it or if I didn't like it because I don't want to keep repeating them just because I didn't try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got B's on the tests and quizzes it's way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done.

I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn't know what kind of video game to make i didn't have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn't know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn't give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily.

some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there's no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn't he just gave up and didn't even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they don't loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

My first experiene was failing the entrance exam to my dream university three times. Yet, fueled by resilience, I attended community college, excelled academically and transferred. My second was a startup venture failing to fund, leading to entrepreneurship pivots before eventually earning initial investment. Winston Churchill's words, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it’s the courage to continue that counts.” inspires me to persevere. A friend quitting after a handful of rejections devastated team spirit momentarily but reignited our resolve. People maintain enthusiasm by reframing failures as lessons and believing relentless tenacity ultimately rewards."," Title: Failure as a Stepping Stone: Inspired by Winston Churchill

Failure experience 1: In high school, I struggled in Advanced Math. Despite repeated attempts, I couldn't grasp the concepts. However, this setback fueled my determination. I sought help from tutors, studied tirelessly, and formed a study group. Eventually, I not only passed the class but also gained a deeper appreciation for the subject.

Failure experience 2: During my freshman year of college, I applied for a prestigious internship and was rejected. Instead of being disheartened, I used the rejection as a motivation to improve my skills and application materials. The following year, I was accepted into the same program and gained invaluable experience.

Winston Churchill's quote, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts,"" profoundly influenced my attitude towards failure. It taught me that setbacks are temporary and that the resilient mindset to face them is essential for long-term success.

Observing someone else give up quickly, such as during a group project, left me feeling disheartened. Their lack of determination affected the morale and progress of the entire team. In contrast, those who persisted despite failures, continued to learn and adapt, inspiring me to take on challenges with renewed enthusiasm.","Title: Turning Defeats Into VictorTES: Churchill, Perseverance, The Founders' Resilience, Inspiration and the First Experiment My first experiene was failing an entrance exam to my dream university.

Task: Analyze and explore the benefits of implementing a curfew for teenagers.","Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.
