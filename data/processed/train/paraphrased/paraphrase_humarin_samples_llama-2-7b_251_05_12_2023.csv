By directly supplying South Africa’s leading toy retailers, the move underscores Hasbro’s strategy to build a stronger presence in emerging markets and will allow the company to build deeper partnerships with new and existing retailers and consumers in South Africa. 

In addition to manufacturing and supplying some of the world’s best-known toys, board and card games, Hasbro and its licensees also offer brand-driven multiplatform gaming and digital experiences, television programming, motion pictures and lifestyle licensing products. By tapping into multiple consumer touch-points, Hasbro can offer a complete experience to consumers. 

Previously, Hasbro’s products were distributed in South Africa by Prima Toys. In line with the company’s commitment to investing in emerging markets, Hasbro has now taken up the role of direct supplier servicing South Africa’s top 10 toy retailers, ranging from toy specialists to mass retail giants, a move which the local industry has greeted with excitement. 

Gavin Mansour, Hasbro business development manager SA, says; “We are excited about being able to fully realise Hasbro’s offering in South Africa. Hasbro has a long and proud tradition of creating the world’s best play experiences for children and families around the world. Through our entry to South Africa, we can now share this tradition by supplying more Hasbro brands and opening up opportunities for localisation.” 

Local trade and industry players can expect to benefit from Hasbro’s entry to the market.  Hasbro can now offer comprehensive services directly to their customers backed by extensive marketing support and investment in brand building. 

“Driving growth in emerging markets is a key priority for Hasbro,’’ says Roger Balser, Hasbro general manager Middle East, Africa and distributor markets. 

He also says; “In South Africa, Hasbro aims to significantly grow the business over the next three years by investing heavily in Hasbro’s local organisational structures and marketing, which should in turn grow the local branded toy market and Hasbro’s market share.” 

Hasbro’s entry into South Africa enables the company to directly engage with key retail outlets servicing the toy industry. Specifically, Hasbro will supply Toys “R” Us, Toy Kingdom, Toy Zone, Toy Adventure, Aladdin’s, Lilliput Toys, Pick n Pay, Shoprite Checkers, Game, Makro, CNA and the recently launched Hamley’s.  Notably, while Hasbro will service the big name brand stores, Prima will continue to supply South Africa’s smaller retailers ensuring Hasbro brands will reach across South Africa. 

Thinking and acting responsibly unlocks new opportunities to improve how the company designs, creates and manufactures its iconic brands. With a focus on key corporate social responsibility areas like product safety, environmental sustainability, ethical sourcing, and community, Hasbro aims to build a safe and sustainable world for future generations and positively impact the lives of millions of children and families every year.

335997,8ac8ef9d-3426-40d3-b9cc-426568f38521,What did we all miss about Royals?,SI.com,"With Thursday night's 10–4 win over the Mariners , the Royals not only became the first team this year to sew up a division title, but they also clinched their division for the first time since they won the World Series in 1985. Remarkably, despite the fact that the team came within 90 feet of tying Game 7 of the World Series against the Giants last fall, almost nobody predicted they would return to the postseason this year, either as a wild card or as the AL Central champion, raising questions as to what everybody missed about a team that has matched last year’s 89 wins with 10 games still to play. 
By everybody, I don't just mean the six writers at SI.com who participated in this year's staff predictions (myself included). Our group was equally split between the Tigers , Indians and White Sox for the AL Central crown and collectively named eight different AL teams as wild-card participants. At ESPN , just two out of 15 experts picked the Royals for the division, with two more tabbing them for a wild-card berth. At CBS Sports , one out of five picked the Royals for the division, with one for the wild card. At Fox Sports , none of the 12 writers tabbed them for the division or the wild card. Nobody among the staffs at the analytically-minded Baseball Prospectus (45 participants) or FanGraphs (38 participants) named them for a postseason berth. The Kansas City Star 's Pete Grathoff , who scoured the internet for even more predictions than the aforementioned, tallied a total of 149 sets of picks and found that the Royals were tabbed for the division just seven times, with six more for a wild card spot. 
Even removing the human element from the equation didn’t help much, as the various projection systems didn't like the Royals either. BP's PECOTA system forecast the team for 72 wins, FanGraphs for 79, and Dan Szymborski's ZiPS for 81. 
 
That's quite a whiff, so much so that Five Thirty Eight's Neil Paine and Rob Arthur published an article on Aug. 7 titled, “ Is 2015 The Year Baseball Projections Failed?"" . While noting that collectively, such systems have trended toward less accuracy at the team level over time, the authors noted, for example, that PECOTA has gotten better at projecting individual rate stats for pitchers and hitters, and even for playing time, but that at the team level, its big misses were getting bigger. They also noted that the game's youth movement may have something to do with it, as the systems collectively found larger projection errors among hitters age 24 and younger, but also proposed explanations involving teams' internal analytical departments doing a better job of identifying underrated players as well as sheer random variance. 
None of that exactly explains the collapse of the heavily-favored Nationals in the NL East or Royals' success, but on the latter front, it's worth noting that one component of the industry's collective failure was its overrating of other AL Central teams. Across all of the aforementioned sites, the Tigers and Indians tended to be the top picks, with the White Sox occasionally drawing mention as well. With four straight division titles plus a rebound of Justin Verlander , better health from Miguel Cabrera , the addition of Yoenis Cespedes and a full season of David Price , the Tigers made for a very plausible pick for another flag. Likewise for the Indians, given their strong second half, the maturation of their young core of starters as well as position players such as Michael Brantley , Lonnie Chisenhall and Yan Gomes , and the expected rebound of Jason Kipnis from a season beset by injuries. You could also see how the White Sox, with their big off-season additions of Jeff Samardzija , David Robertson , Melky Cabrera and Adam LaRoche plus the arrival of Carlos Rodon , could draw support as well. I myself tabbed Detroit to win the division with Cleveland securing a wild-card berth. Whoops.


Much of the resistance to picking the Royals likely had to do with the perceived strength of their offense, which despite ranking second in batting average in 2014 (.263) was ninth in both on-base percentage (.314) and scoring (4.02 runs per game), 11th in slugging percentage (.376) and dead last in homers (95). Alex Gordon and Lorenzo Cain were the only regulars to post an OPS+ of 100 or better; Mike Moustakas (75) and Omar Infante (76) were abysmal, and while catcher Salvador Perez (91) and shortstop Alcides Escobar (93) could be excused coming from defense-first positions, the same couldn't be said for first baseman Eric Hosmer (99). Even general manager Dayton Moore's changes, such as moving from Nori Aoki (99) to Alex Rios (97 with the Rangers ) in rightfield or Billy Butler (96) to Kendrys Morales (75 with the Twins and Mariners) at designated hitter, appeared to be shaky bets on 30-something players returning to form after down seasons. 
• MORE MLB: Full playoff standings, postseason odds, magic numbers 
 
Lo and behold, Kansas City's offense has improved dramatically, ranking fifth in scoring at 4.53 runs per game, first in batting average (.273) and sixth in both on-base and slugging percentages (.324 and .417, respectively) even while still ranking 13th in homers (132). While Rios (93 OPS+), Perez (89), Escobar (68) and especially Infante (49) have again been laggards, Cain (129), Morales (127), Hosmer (125), Gordon (123) and Moustakas (120) have all been forces to reckon with. Versatile July 28 acquisition Ben Zobrist (139) has been a huge addition, helping to cover for Gordon's absence due to a groin strain and then taking over second base from Infante. 
Three of the players setting career highs are in the 25–29 range during which hitters tend to peak. Hosmer and Moustakas, both of whom were top-three draft picks and top-10 prospects, are in their age-25 and 26 seasons, respectively. Both have made adjustments that allow them to approach their considerable potential; the former, for example, is swinging at fewer pitches, particularly outside the strike zone, and the latter has become significantly less pull-happy. Cain, in his age-29 season, has avoided the disabled list for the first time in his career and has already set career highs in most of his counting stats (including 16 homers, up from five last year) and slash stats (.307/.363/.482). Meanwhile, Morales had the benefit of a full spring training this time around; the qualifying offer he received following the 2013 season cooled interest in him to the point that he did not sign a contract until June of last year. 
On the other side of the ball, some of the resistance to picking the Royals likely had to do with the departure of staff leader James Shields , whose acquisition in a December 2012 blockbuster had indeed heralded the team's turn towards contention. Replacing his 227 innings of 3.21 ERA work was no trivial matter, and while some (myself included) expected youngsters Yordano Ventura and Danny Duffy help to pick up the slack, that's not the way it's gone down. Both have been slightly below league average and struggled to stay in the rotation due to injuries and underperformance. Ventura was even briefly optioned to Triple A, and while his performance has trended upward, his 4.40 ERA is nothing to write home about. Neither is Dufy's 4.22 mark; he has been moved to the bullpen in anticipation of a postseason role, as he served last year. 
 
• JAFFE: Where Yogi Berra ranks among game's all-time greats 
 
Indeed, where the rotation as a whole ranked fourth in the league in ERA (3.60) and ninth in FIP (3.89), this year they're 12th (4.45) and 13th (4.40), respectively. Free agent Edinson Volquez , who enjoyed a strong rebound in Pittsburgh last year after an abysmal 2013, has been the only starter to stick in the rotation for the entire season while preventing runs at a better-than-average clip, with a 3.62 ERA (113 ERA+). It's worth noting that fellow free-agent additions Chris Young (3.49 ERA in 16 starts) and Kris Medlen (3.93 in six starts) have been effective in shorter bursts; the former was moved to the bullpen in August out of workload concerns, and the latter joined the rotation later that month as he rounded into form while coming back from his second Tommy John surgery. Among the rest, Jason Vargas was lost to TJ after nine starts and Jeremy Guthrie has been blitzed for a 5.95 ERA. Late July acquisition Johnny Cueto , expected to serve as staff ace heading into the postseason, has been erratic, pitching to a 4.99 ERA in 11 starts. 
On the other hand, the vaunted Royals bullpen as a whole has actually improved over last year, at least in terms of ERA; they've gone from fourth in the league at 3.40 to first at 2.70. Their FIP, on the other hand, has slipped from 3.29 (second) to 3.58 (fifth) and their strikeout rate (23.0% last year, 22.6% this year) has remained sixth. What's more, the big three of closer Greg Holland and setup men Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera has regressed from last year's record-setting feats. This week brought the news that Holland was not only out of the ninth-inning job but has also been shut down and may be headed for Tommy John surgery . Davis has actually approximated last year's showing in terms of ERA (from 1.00 to 0.99) even while his FIP has doubled (1.19 to 2.44). Even so, the unit is deeper thanks to the performances of righties Ryan Madson , Luke Hochevar and Young and lefty Franklin Morales . Manager Ned Yost may not have the luxury of the same type of push-button choices as he did last October, but he has the weapons to match up batter by batter if he so desires. 
One thing that hasn’t changed: The team does have an above-average defense. Last year, the Royals ranked second in the AL in Defensive Runs Saved (+41 runs) and sixth in defensive efficiency (.693), while this year, they’re first in the former (+54) and fifth in the latter (.700). 
Particularly in a year that’s been noted for its parity, with no team winning 100 games and with five of the six division leaders yet to reach 90 wins, I’m not sure there’s a lesson here other than, “Don’t put too much stock in preseason predictions.” In the case of the Royals, their bullpen and defense remained strengths despite shifting casts of characters, while an area of strength (the rotation) became one of weakness, offsetting the opposite from the offense. What can be said is that while Moore didn’t spend a ton of money over the winter, he hit on more of his major additions (Morales, Volquez, Young, Madson, Morales) than he missed (Rios), and neither Shields nor Butler has given much reason to lament their departures given their 2015 performances elsewhere. Likewise, the GM’s addition of Zobrist has been a huge win, and that of Cueto may yet pay off. 
Despite their thrilling October run last year and the league’s best record this year, the Royals are by no means guaranteed to get back to the World Series. Still, the AL Central champs deserve hearty congratulations for overcoming the collective doubts about their fitness to defend last year’s pennant, and—by avoiding the do-or-die wild card and positioning themselves for home field advantage for the duration of their postseason run (they have a two-game lead over the Blue Jays for the league’s best record)—for giving themselves an even better chance at capturing a championship this time around.

Eventually, though, UNC's superior talent and depth allowed it to pull away. The Tar Heels, led by backup quarterback Mitch Trubisky in the second half, scored three touchdowns in a span of about 12 minutes to erase any doubt of the outcome.

Marquise Williams, the UNC starting quarterback, came out of the game late in the first half and watched the second half from the sideline. His status, and whether he'd been pulled because of injury or early ineffectiveness, was unclear when the game ended.

Turning point

It was a one-possession game late in the third quarter until Trubisky's 64-yard touchdown pass to Mack Hollins gave the Tar Heels a 27-14 lead. UNC's defense forced a three-and-out on Delaware's ensuing possession and Trubisky led another quick touchdown drive to widen the margin.

Three who mattered

_Trubisky: The Tar Heels' backup quarterback made his case for an expanded role after entering the game late in the first half. He played the rest of the game and completed 17 of his 20 attempts for 312 yards and four touchdowns.

_Hollins: UNC's most formidable deep threat a season ago broke out with two touchdown receptions on Saturday - his first two of the season. He entered Saturday with 32 yards receiving and then caught three passes for 100 yards against Delaware.

_Ryan Switzer: Another game, another long touchdown for Switzer, who did most of the work himself on his 63-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter. He caught five passes for 89 yards.

Three key numbers

_568: Total yards for UNC, which gained 366 of them after halftime. It was the first time this season the Tar Heels surpassed 500 yards in total offense.

_13: Points UNC scored off four trips to the red zone in the first half. Taking better advantage of scoring opportunities will be a point of emphasis for the Tar Heels as they enter ACC play.

Modified atmosphere packaging is the replacement of air in a pack with a single gas or a mixture of gases, wherein the proportion of each component is fixed, when the mixture is introduced in the pack. High barrier substrates, such as ethylene vinyl alcohol, poly ethylene, oriented polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, and others, become MAP packages after they are formed into trays, lid stock or bags, and are filled with a selected blend of different gases. The modified atmosphere packaging concept for packaged goods is the procedure of modifying the atmosphere surrounding a food product by vacuum, gas flushing, or controlled permeability of the pack, thus, controlling the biochemical, enzymatic, and microbial actions to decrease the degradations/spoilage that might occur in a food item. This allows preservation of freshness of the food product without controlling the temperature or subjecting it to any chemical treatments, such as canning, freezing, dehydration, and other processes. Hence, modified atmosphere packaging is an optimum blend of pure oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen within either a high barrier or permeable package. These blends of gases are modified as per the respiratory needs of the packaged product. 

The global Modified Atmosphere Packaging Market is projected to reach $13.78 Billion by 2020. In 2015, North America is estimated to be the largest market for modified atmosphere packaging. Furthermore, Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing market for modified atmosphere packaging during the period under consideration. This market is also driven by the rising income levels, changing lifestyles, and growing demand for convenience and ready-to-eat foods in the emerging economies.

112851,aee602f2-dc36-43ef-962a-1d1030a18500,"GreenDispenser ATM malware found in the wild, stealing cash from banks",Security Bloggers Network,"Banks have another security headache on their hands, as ATM-infecting malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated in its attempt to help criminals audaciously empty out cash machines on the high street on demand, without having to have previously stolen the payment cards of legitimate customers. Dubbed GreenDispenser by researchers at Proofpoint, the new malware targeting ATMs allows thieves to extract large amounts of money from cash machines, while using sneaky techniques to avoid detection. Here’s how GreenDispenser works. Firstly, the ATM needs to be infected by the GreenDispenser malware. This would most likely require the attackers to have unrestricted physical access to the device, or assistance from bank employees. Earlier this month, security blogger Brian Krebs wrote a series of articles about what he claimed was an organised crime gang, bribing ATM technicians into meddling with the cash machines in and around Cancun, Mexico. But once the malware is in place on the ATM, an “out of service” message is displayed – preventing any law-abiding members of the public from withdrawing any money which might lessen the haul for the hackers. So, how does a criminal extract cash from an “out of service” ATM? Well, all they need to do is enter a hardcoded authorisation PIN code to give them special access to the system. Remarkably, possibly to prevent others from abusing the PIN code if it is shared indiscreetly (there’s no honour amongst thieves it seems), the malware includes a two-factor authentication feature to verify that the person entering the PIN code is who they claim to be. That’s better security than any legitimate bank customer gets when they use an ATM! With the initial hardcoded PIN entered, the ATM thief is presented with a scannable QR code, that can be scanned with a smartphone app. This then generates a second PIN, which will unlock an ATM menu screen, revealing options to dispense or even securely erase the malware from the ATM in a bid to prevent analysis by security researchers. Malware infecting ATMs is, sadly, nothing new and this blog has reported numerous times in the past on gangs who have stolen millions of dollars after installing malware that helps them scoop up card details of ATM users or even empty cash out of bank’s cash machines right there on the high street. The researchers at Proofpoint say that GreenDispenser is thought to have been found in “certain geographic regions such as Mexico”, but the fear is that if it continues to prove fruitful for the criminals new versions of the malware could be used against banks worldwide. It certainly wouldn’t be a surprise – Tyupkin, another strain of ATM malware that GreenDispenser appears to be related to, has been seen in several countries around the world. Tim Erlin, Tripwire’s director of IT security and risk strategy, told the press earlier this month after the discovery of a further sample of malware that it pays to be cautious before sticking your payment card in a hole in the wall: “Embedded systems, like ATMs and point-of-sale devices, present unique challenges for information security, and unique opportunities for attackers. We’re fast approaching a situation where consumers need to have a healthy scepticism for security of the devices into which they stick their cards.” He’s right, of course. But malware like GreenDispenser isn’t interested in bank customers’ credit card details – because it steals directly from the banks. And while attacks like this continue to succeed, you have to suspect that more and more criminals will waltz around the middle-man, and go directly to where the money is. Bank security teams need to keep on top of the latest tricks used by ATM-infecting malware, and look long and hard at their security to ensure that no-one inside their organisation could be giving ATM hackers a helping hand.

411422,5ad588c3-b1c3-4f40-9e35-2d8a22c27fdc,Charles Morrow: Remembers engineering feats at Monte Cassino,Gainesville Times,"WWII veteran Charles Morrow describes his experience during the war and how he kissed the ground when he finally got to go home. 

Charles Morrow was angry at first.

As a black man serving in the segregated U.S. armed forces, the Gainesville man resented that he had to be a servant, not a soldier.

But as time passed, and especially today, as the 92-year-old Morrow reflects on his World War II years, his perspective changed.

“Somebody’s got to make sure that the soldiers who are fighting get food, clothing, shelter, ammunition, everything they need to keep the war in our favor,” he said.

“I looked at it from the point of view of ... what I did was good for this country.”

While segregation was the rule, the Army Air Corps did establish several African-American fighter and bomber groups — most notably, the “Tuskegee Airmen” of the 332nd Fighter Group, which became part of the 15th Air Force.

The airmen would go on to become one of America’s most successful fighting units.

Morrow believes their success likely stemmed from their need to prove their worth as warriors.

They had “to prove to the world, but especially America, that we were as good at what we did as anybody else,” he said.

Morrow’s military experience began before World War II.

He joined the Army after graduating from high school in May 1941, getting his basic training at Myrtle Beach, S.C.

When war was declared following the Pearl Harbor attack, Morrow was sent to Philadelphia, where he did guard duty at a Navy shipyard. Then he was sent to Europe, where Nazi Germany was wreaking havoc.

Initially, Morrow was based in England as part of the Army’s Quartermaster Corps, which was responsible for supplying troops at the front lines with arms, munitions, food and clothing.

Some memories are fading for Morrow, but a couple are still fresh.

While in the Army Quartermaster Corps, he and others were in a supply depot when German planes flew overhead, attacking Allied positions on the ground.

“I was running, trying to get out of the way and had to jump over a barbed wire fence,” Morrow said. “It was in the winter and I had on an Army overcoat, which got caught in the barbed wire, and I could not move.”

It was a good thing he was stuck, however. The next bullets struck the ground where his feet were set to land.

“I am quite sure that ... would have got me,” Morrow said. “I consider myself as being fortunate, as being one of those who was in a combat situation and didn’t get a scratch on me.”

He later was shipped to North Africa, still as part of the Quartermaster Corps, and then served in engineer and communication units, ending his war career in the mountains of Italy.

As a member of combat engineers, his group was building a bridge over the Arno, a river in the Tuscany region of Italy.

“That’s when I lost one of my best friends, who was drowned,” Morrow said. “He fell in the river and we couldn’t rescue him.”

And at Monte Cassino, a rocky hill southeast of Rome, “every time we built a bridge, it was blown up” by the Germans, he said.

Morrow was in Italy when the war ended with the official surrender of the Japanese in Tokyo Bay on Sept. 2, 1945.

He doesn’t recall much about the mood of soldiers at the time. Many of them were fighting a new war: boredom. Their time in Italy after the German surrender in May 1945 was meant as a respite from the bloody war.

“We had very little, if anything, to do,” Morrow said.

By that point, many troops looked upon the Japanese surrender as eventual, especially with the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

“We were glad it was over with, but we accepted it as a matter of fact because we felt that was what was going to happen,” Morrow said.

As for the war itself, he doesn’t study it too much these days.

“But when I do, it seems to come vividly in my mind,” Morrow said. “I’m glad that it doesn’t show up in my life more than what it does.”

There’s a big trend for gopro and drone footage these days, but we think you’ll agree this one is really special. While out having some fun with a rubber ring, a speed boat and a drone camera off the coast of Donegal, these folks caught some incredible footage of 40 to 50 dolphins frolicking in the waves. 

The folks from Eye in the Sky posted this footage taken off Malin Head in County Donegal . The video shows the pod of dolphins racing beside the speed boat and playing, darting back and forth with each other like excited puppies. 

On YouTube they wrote: 

“I was out on my friend's boat in Malin Head Co. Donegal to mess about on a rubber ring when a pod of Dolphins came cruising alongside to check us out. You can only see a small number of them but there was between 40-50 Dolphins in the pod. Managed to get my drone over them for a close up. Amazing experience.”

Dolphins are probably a species that you would more readily associate with warmer climates like Florida but, according to the group Shannon Dolphins , the bottle nose dolphin is familiar and abundant in Ireland’s waters. In fact, it’s just one of 24 species of cetacean ( whales , dolphins and porpoise) recorded in Irish waters. Of course, we have our resident dolphin Fungie, but it seems to us that more and more up close and personal encounters with these beasts are being recorded.

It is the highest number since officials began collecting data in September 2001 and higher than the previous peak of 284, which was recorded in 2005, the year of the July 7 bombings. 

			 
Officials say there has been a ""marked increase"" in the number of those arrested who consider themselves to be of British or British dual nationality. 



 
In 2014/15, they accounted for more than three-quarters of those detained for terrorism-related offences, compared with 52% in the year to March 2011. 

The figures also showed that the number of 18 to 20-year-olds arrested more than doubled on the previous year from 20 to 43. 

A large amount of the overall increase was driven by a spike in the last three months of last year, when there were 106 arrests. 

The rate fell from January to March this year, with 67 terror-related arrests, but this was still higher than the same period in the previous two years. 

			 
A Home Office statistical bulletin setting out the data said: "" Since 11 September 2001 the numbers of terrorism-related arrests have fluctuated. 

""There was an  initial spike in the number of arrests in the period soon after the September 11 attacks on the US  and around the time that the US-led invasion of Afghanistan was beginning. 

""There was a large  increase in the number of arrests in the period immediately after the 7 July London bombings, where  the number of arrests was at its highest since the data collection was established. Soon after this, the  number of terrorism-related arrests declined, until late 2010. 

""In late 2010, the Arab Springs began, and  throughout the years since the initial uprising, the number of terrorism-related arrests in Great Britain  has seen a steady rise."" 

			 
The total number of terror arrests in the UK since the Twin Towers atrocity 14 years ago is just short of 3,000. 

The data also showed that a record 35 females were arrested on suspicion of terror offences after the number more than trebled in five years. The increase in women being arrested was driven by a surge between October and March. 

Eight of those arrested were under 18. 

Senior officers have recently warned of a step change in the terrorism landscape, with women and children increasingly at risk of radicalisation. 

A string of high-profile cases have emerged in which women are said to have taken their children to territory controlled by IS in Syria. 

			 
There has also been a significant increase in the number of suspects arrested who were aged 30 and over, with a rise of more than a third compared to the previous year. 

Of the 299 people arrested in 2014/15, less than half - or 100 - were ultimately charged with terror-related offences. 

The Home Office said this was the highest proportion since records started, ""suggesting that police were more frequently able to find  evidence to support the link to terrorism following a terrorism-related arrest"". 

It is likely that the volume of terrorism arrests has risen further since the period covered by the statistics. 

Last month Mark Rowley, the country's leading counter-terrorism officer, disclosed that suspects are now being held at a rate of more than one a day. 

Fifty-six of the arrests related to international-related terrorism - defined as ""activities linked to or motivated by any terrorist group based outside the UK"". This was more than a third (35%) higher than 2013/14. 

The number of suspects arrested over domestic terrorism - where there is no link to Northern Ireland or international groups, more than doubled from 15 to 32. 

Security Minister John Hayes said the Government is determined to detect and disrupt all terror threats to the UK. 

He added: "" The figures released today once again highlight the hard work carried out by the police, Security Service and Crown Prosecution Service to keep the public safe - and emphasise the scale of that challenge. 

""At a time of very significant threat, it is vital they have the powers they need to protect the British public."" 

Laws rolled out earlier this year have "" bolstered our already considerable armoury of powers to disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight, reduce the risks they pose on their return and combat the underlying ideology that feeds, supports and sanctions terrorism,"" he said. 

Mr Hayes said the forthcoming Investigatory Powers Bill, covering the controversial issue of security services' access to communications data, will ensure they are "" equipped with up to date capabilities to protect us from those who would seek to do us harm.""

New ways to grab dinner, the trick to using a tool, and learning the local dialect. These are behaviors that animals pick up from each other. K iller whales ,   chimpanzees , and   birds   seem to have a cultural component to their lives. Now a new study suggests that   sperm whales   should be added to that list. 
   
(From National Geographic / by Jane J. Lee) — The ocean around the   Galápagos Islands   hosts thousands of female sperm whales and their calves that have organized into clans with their own dialects. (Mature males congregate in colder waters near the poles.) How these clans form has been something of a mystery until now. 
  

  
A   study published Tuesday   in the journal   Nature Communications   suggests that culture—behaviors shared by group members—keeps these sperm whale clans together. Specifically, these deep-diving whales have a distinct series of clicks called codas they use to communicate during social interactions. 
 
Sperm whales with similar behaviors spend time together, and they pick up vocalizations from each other. Scientists call this social learning. Whales that “speak the same language” stick together, giving rise to the clans that researchers have observed for more than 30 years. 
  
This is one more pillar of support for the idea that animals have culture, says lead study author   Mauricio Cantor , a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. 
   
When Cantor and colleagues ran computer simulations to determine the most likely way the clans formed, factors like genetic relatedness or the transmission of information from mother to offspring couldn’t explain the pattern observed in the wild. The best explanation their analysis could find was a preference in how sperm whales learned vocalizations. “Like-minded” individuals learned from each other.  

  
It’s fascinating to see that animals like whales display something that may seem uniquely human, Cantor says. But really, “we’re not that different from them.” 
   
Killer whale pods have their own dialects, humpback whales pass on new feeding behaviors via their social networks, and chimpanzees share the secrets of tool use with their compatriots. 
   
Cantor hopes that by learning more and more about animals, people will be moved to think about the environment and perhaps act on calls for conserving the planet.

Twice Preston came from behind, firstly when Hugill cancelled out MacDonald's goal to earn extra time and then when a late Johnston penalty forced a penalty shootout after Pugh again put Bournemouth ahead in the extra period, but after this two-two draw it was the Cherries that advanced beating PNE three-two on penalties.

An upset was something people could sense, at least wanted, ahead of the game, but poor defending from Preston helped MacDonald (23) into heading Bournemouth into the lead at the midway point of the first half.

With an exit looking on Cunningham's cross gave Hugill (84), who had come off the bench, the chance to equalise and the striker took this as he headed home to force extra time with six-minutes left.

King had seen his initial effort blocked but when it dropped to Pugh (96) he made no mistake as he forced the ball home to again have Bournemouth ahead in the first period of extra time.

It was Pugh's handball though that gave Preston a dramatic late chance to force a penalty shootout, which Johnson (118) did when he beat Federici from spot.

Hugill, the hero towards the end of the 90-minutes, and Browne both had penalties saved with Sunderland loanee 'keeper Pickford keeping out Gosling's to keep Preston in the game.

However, unlike his effort to force penalties, Johnson couldn't beat former Reading 'keeper Federici again to keep the tie alive with his save putting the Cherries into the fourth round after a three-two shootout win.

There wasn't to be a Preston upset, like the win over Watford in the last round, this time with PNE no left to 'concentrate on the league', until the FA Cup anyway!

An upset was something people could sense, at least wanted, ahead of the game, but poor defending from Preston helped MacDonald (23) into heading the side in front and after a brief and very short lived spell of ball possession and attack Brian McDermott conceded and the penalty awarded, only for an appeal which would have meant torrents of abuse from the amped up Red Army that the foul hadn't brought a penalty, was not made. A threat affected Preston, but lack of coaching but Kwas","home his low effort past Rudd who had tried taking himself off injured before he even realised there would need saving - perhaps due to hearing cheers for having saved Foley just four minutes earlier!

VANCOUVER, BC –(Marketwired – September 12, 2015) - The team members at QS Fencing, a Vancouver Fencing and Gate Installation company , know there are many reasons to put up fencing. One of the most common is to discourage wildlife, and this fencing must be checked and maintained, particularly during the fall season. 
 
“This is a high risk time for wildlife encounters,” says a company representative. “As animals start preparing for winter, they will be searching for food, and the lure of scraps and edible garbage can bring bears, skunks, raccoons, and deer closer to neighborhoods and homes.” 
 
Although most animals are skittish and pose little threat, there can be altercations, particularly when children are present. It is therefore advisable to anticipate risks and take precautions. 
 
“Look for any holes or erosion at the base of your fence. Check fasteners and holders on metal gates. Make sure they are secure and line up, so nothing can squeeze through. If you do notice something that needs attention, contact a fence repair expert.” 
 
With a little attention, you can drastically reduce chance encounters between humans and wildlife. The best advice is to be aware of your surroundings and make sure any barriers in place are maintained for maximum protection.

Chinese billionaire funding our MPs

EXCLUSIVE

He may have made his fortune in China's property market, but Dr Chau Chak Wing is making a name for himself in higher education, with yet another multimillion dollar donation to an Australian university.

A $15 million gift from the reclusive Chinese-Australian entrepreneur will help fund a new museum at the University of Sydney.

The Chau Chak Wing Museum will comprise two of the university's historic buildings, joined by a new extension, and cost an estimated $42 million.

The rest of the new museum's costs would be met from the university's operating budget, specific project grants, revenue from the museum's café and shop and philanthropy, according to the director of Sydney University's museums, David Ellis.

The Chau Chak Wing Museum would be unique among Sydney's cultural institutions, Mr Ellis said. ""A multi-disciplinary museum where the arts and sciences meet and ancient worlds encounter contemporary art and ideas.""

The new museum will house artistic, scientific and archaeological artefacts from the Macleay, Nicholson and University Art Gallery collections. It will include gallery spaces, teaching areas and a venue for public events as well as an exhibition area for Chinese art and artefacts when it opens in 2018.

""I hope that this collaboration will further promote education and enlighten people, building a platform for greater international cultural exchange,"" Dr Chau said. ""This donation is my heartfelt contribution to developing the Australia-China friendship.""

The $15 million gift is one of the five largest donations given to the University of Sydney as part of its Inspired campaign, which was launched in 2008 to raise $600 million.

It follows Dr Chau's $20 million donation to the University of Technology Sydney to help fund its new Frank Gehry-designed Business School building in Ultimo, which bears his name. Dr Chau, whose son Eric studied at UTS, also donated $5 million to fund Australia-China scholarships.

The building of Chau Chak Wing Museum adds to the building boom in Sydney's cultural institutions, with plans to redevelop the Australian Museum, Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney Opera House, Walsh Bay as well as arts facilities in western Sydney. The Powerhouse Museum will also be moved from Ultimo to Parramatta.

Sydney University's vice-chancellor, Michael Spence, compared the new museum to the world's first university museum in Oxford.

""I'd draw a parallel with the Ashmolean in Oxford in the sense that it is also a museum that has a whole variety of things. It's not just a picture gallery,"" he said. ""In the same way, this will have even more because the Ashmolean doesn't have ethnographic or etymological collections.""

Dr Spence said the $15 million donation was driven by Dr Chau's passion to open up the university's collection of 700,000 items to the public – 99 per cent of which are currently held in storage out of public view.

Dr Chau has a significant art collection, particularly of historical Chinese artefacts, at his Imperial Springs resort in Guangdong.

Dr Spence said Dr Chau had a strong commitment to deepening ties between Australia and China beyond commerce.

""I really enjoy Dr Chau's company,"" he said. ""He is a man who started life as a house painter and became a very successful businessman.

""He did that just by being a constant source of new ideas. He is very interested in the world and he is very future looking.""

Dr Chau, reportedly one of Australia's biggest political donors, also purchased James Packer's La Mer property in Vaucluse last month for an Australian record price of $70 million.

The university's cultural and scientific collections contain more than 700,000 items, including nine of the earliest known Indigenous bark paintings (from Western Arnhem Land), a 500,000-year-old palaeolithic hand axe from northern France; a 3300-year-old ancient Egyptian statue of Horemheb, who led Tutankhamun's armies and more than 1000 natural history specimens.

The total eclipse will begin at 9:11 p.m. CT, and it’s the last one visible anywhere in the world until 2018. If skies are clear it should be a good show.

During this celestial event the Earth passes between the moon and Sun, and the moon’s surface will appear reddish for more than an hour under the core of Earth’s shadow.

But have you ever wondered what this would look like from the surface of the moon? Now, thanks to NASA, there’s an animation for that. Above there’s a still image of what the Earth would like from the moon. From the moon’s perspective this is a solar eclipse.

Here’s what it looks like in animation form 

The stunning circle of fire around the Earth is caused by the planet’s atmosphere bending light. From the moon you’re seeing every single sunset and sunrise on Earth at each given moment.

One day, hopefully in my lifetime, we’ll be able to buy a ticket to see the show appears from the moon.

862166,31607c7a-cde8-408c-bcab-ce705bdd4615,$17K down the drain as company goes bust,NewsMail,"LISA McDade will fight to wrest the $17,000 she is owed from failed accounting firm Talos Accounting Group. 
 
The single working mum and owner of Gladstone cleaning firm Domestic Bliss Total Solutions is just one of the creditors likely to miss out on being paid following the liquidation of Talos Accounting Group, the company that owned LBS Accountants until recently. 
 
Ms McDade has been the cleaner at LBS long before the company was bought by Talos in 2013. But she says the payment problems only started after the business was sold. 
 
""I wasn't getting paid and it was only about five or six months ago I realised that things weren't good, and I started to put pressure on Talos to be paid,"" she said. 
 
""I am in a difficult position because not only am I the cleaner - LBS is my accountant - so it was a bit embarrassing asking for the money I was owed."" 
 
She said she was fobbed off by the company time and time again with a variety of stories; right up to the time of the liquidation on August 11. 
 
""When I first started hassling them, Bob Hughes, who was my manager, told me it would be all sorted soon after the end of the financial year. That day came and went and there was no sign of any money."" 
 
Eighteen months ago it was Milan Versic that sold LBS to Talos; leaving some funds in the business and retaining ownership of the Auckland St building. 
 
But he too has lost out - not only with the remainder of the purchase price, but also in lost rent, although he didn't say how much. 
 
Mr Versic continued to work for the company after selling the business to a company that appears to have ties with a former bankrupt New Zealand businessman involved in one of that country's major financial collapses. 
 
After Talos started missing payments for buying the business, Mr Versic and his partner stopped working for them. 
 
""Then we did more research and lo and behold Mark Ryan (the Talos representative they dealt with) is Mark Bryers,"" Mr Versic said. ""He was the head honcho; the man we would report to."" 
 
Mark Bryers was the co-founder of New Zealand's 2008 failed Blue Chip property investment scheme that left more than 2000 investors with losses of more than $310 million at the time. 
 
Mr Bryers' bankruptcy has been lifted but he is still banned from managing or directing a company for seven years. 
 
""The plans were to grow to 100 firms Australia-wide and float it on the stock exchange,"" Mr Versic said. 
 
""We met him a few times in Gladstone and he was in charge of the direction the firm was going."" 
 
On August 11 they were going to evict the Talos Group from the office but the company had already left. 
 
He said he was still owed one-third of the sale price of the business. 
 
Talos Group's liquidator, BRI Ferrier manager Alan Tang, said creditors like Mr Versic who had debts from before August 11 would not see a return; everything the company has will go to the banks. 
 
""The director, Stephen Lacy, has provided a number of personal guarantees and he will go bankrupt in the near future. He has put family home on the line,"" he said. 
 
""Creditors are going to have to write off their debts and move on.""",567,"five or six months ago I realised that things weren't good, and I started to put pressure on Talos to be paid,"" she said.

605539,9424bea3-e7b2-47c4-bdaf-26ed0f236448,"Construction Sites, Things Fall Apart and Nigeria",The Flying Otter,"So, I just put coffee in a glass. In a glass people. And this was in spite of the fact that I know glass can actually break when you pour liquid into it that's too hot.

As you can tell, I'm getting a little bit desperate - this summer our house has turned into a bit of a construction site, since my parents decided they wanted a completely new veranda, on top of completely new windows. I haven't been able to use our kitchen in three days and at this point I'm beginning to feel the caffeine withdrawal. So, coffee in a glass it is! (I was bold and stole the coffee out of one of the drawers my mother had sealed air-tight ... but psssst!) The downside is, it's black coffee, since I couldn't get the milk out of the fridge. I suppose this will have to be this night's shenanigan ...

Reading-wise, I've also had an exciting week, since I finished reading Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. It's an amazing novel, honestly - it depicts the life in an Igbo village in Nigeria before and during colonisation by focussing on one man and his family in particular. The fascinating thing is that the book actually comes down critical on both sides though, namely on the main character as well as the Christian missionaries. It's not a black and white thing at all, which makes the story seem all the more real to me.


For honesty's sake, I should tell you though that this wasn't an easy book to get into at first. The author uses a lot of Igbo words and phrases in his narration, which are very confusing in the beginning. But don't let that deter you, if you do decide to read this book as well! The more chapters I read, the more I fell in love with the inclusion of these words and phrases - it really adds to the atmosphere of the novel. And besides, it's not like I don't do the same in everyday language, only with English and French. Sometimes words in another language just fit certain concepts better. And that's certainly true for words like chi, which in Igbo apparently means a kind of personal deity that watches over you.

Anyway, so I came away really loving this book, and then I realised that I know absolutely nothing about Nigeria ... So I went and did some research and then made a powerpoint presentation about it! (You would be wrong in thinking that I have too much time on my hands ...)



Can you believe that there are actually 182 million people living in Nigeria, which makes it the most populous country in Africa (7th most populous in the world!)? I had no clue! (And neither did my best friend - she thought more along the lines of 18 million ...) And then there all these different ethnic groups living in the same country - more than 500 with more than 500 languages! It's just mind-boggling! Although it really does explain why Achebe chose to write his novel in English: he said himself that he viewed English as a tool to enable all Nigerians to speak to each other, no matter their first language. Thus, by writing in English he hoped to reach every Nigerian citizen, I believe.

The reason why there's this blue arrow on the right is that I wanted to point out the setting of the story: it's set in an Igbo village, after all, and the Igbo people apparently primarily live in that light-brownish area. They're the third biggest ehtnic group in the country by the way - after Yoruba and Hausa. Quite impressive I think ;).

I've actually made a couple more slides about Nigeria with pictures of the country as well as a detailed character map of the novel, but I'll spare you I think ;). I'll let out my inner Mad Hatter another day.

For now I'll leave you with this Sherlock video to Ed Sheeran's Photograph, which has had me captivated for the last couple of days:



... Okay, I lied, there's one more thing, namely this song:



I JUST LOVE IT! It's got the right kind of soothing sadness (I don't care if that's an oxymoron) to it and it makes me go UGGGH every time I hear it. I hope it can do the same for you!

Learn how Oncor incentives can make energy efficiency an affordable reality for your home through three separate programs: home efficiency, low income, and solar power. Tiffany Aller	Sep 11, 2015	The cost of home repairs and updates can easily spiral into thousands of dollars. And when it comes to heating or cooling your home, those numbers can multiply even more astronomically. The good news for Dallas and Fort Worth area homeowners is that energy efficient homes are now made more affordable through incentives offered by Oncor energy delivery. Most of the state of Texas is on its own electrical grid — no small feat, since the entire country only has three electrical grids in total throughout the continental United States. So the good news is that Texas is not reliant on power produced elsewhere to fuel its homes and businesses. On the flip side, however, is that Texans use a lot of power, which is why the Texas legislature passed what is now known as the “Energy Efficiency Rule,” which mandates that money be set aside by electric delivery corporations each year to fund incentives for homeowners to create more efficient homes. Energy Efficiency for Low Income Families If your household meets stringent low income guidelines, the incentives set aside by Oncor could fund a majority of your energy efficient upgrades, from adding insulation to sealing your home to upgrading your indoor and outdoor healing and cooling appliances. Incentives may also pay to cover making your water spigots in bathrooms and kitchens more efficient, as well as installing more efficient lighting throughout your home. Energy Updates Regardless of Income If your household doesn’t meet low income guidelines, you can take advantage of a separate pool of Oncor incentives to majorly subsidize the costs of improving your home’s energy efficiency. The general home efficiency incentives plan includes the following as eligible upgrades that you can pursue for greatly reduced costs: Increasing your attic insulation to recommended standards Sealing your windows and doors to prevent costly drafts Ensuring your ductwork is both sealed and working appropriately without energy loss Upgrading heating and cooling equipment Installing Energy Star appliances and fixtures. Solar Power for Energy Efficient Homes A final pool of Oncor incentives can heavily subsidize the cost of installing solar panels at your residence to provide an alternate form of power for your home. Not only can solar panels greatly reduce your home’s reliance on the Texas electrical grid, but if enough energy is produced, you may, in fact, sell the overage back to the electrical company to use for other homes. So not only can you install panels at a great savings, you might also reduce or lose your electrical bill entirely or even make a few dollars along the way. Join In Oncor incentives are released each spring and are available until the funds designated for that calendar years are exhausted. Depending on how many homeowners jump on these incentives to upgrade to energy efficient homes each year, funds may remain available either for only a month or sometimes throughout the entire spring and summer. Begin watching for program announcements on www.takealoadofftexas.com each year in the early spring and then use that site to locate approved providers in your zip code. The provider you choose will conduct an energy audit of your home and prepare a proposal to show what upgrades may be covered entirely, what may be subsidized to reduce cost, and what additional updates you may consider but that are outside of the program’s scope. You must use an approved provider, as only they can receive incentives on your behalf. Incentives are paid directly to service providers, meaning that you only have to worry about the additional costs you may agree to for further upgrades. Ready? Set. Get efficient!

Pope Francis said in an address at the White House that climate change ""can no longer be left to a future generation."" 
President Obama welcomed Pope Francis to the White House this morning before a cheering throng of thousands. 

In an address, President Obama welcomed Pope Francis to Washington on Wednesday and credited the pontiff for setting a moral example that is ""shaking us out of our complacency"" with his reminders to care for the poor and the planet. 

The pope arrived in Washington D.C., yesterday in his first trip to the United States. He is only the third pontiff to appear in America. 

After a meeting with President Obama, the Pope will later appear at a mass at the Basilica. 

WATCH LIVE STREAM OF POPE FRANCIS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 

A presidential first unfolded yesterday at Andrews Air Force Base, where President Obama left the White House for the first time to greet an arriving dignitary. Along with the president and his family was Vice President Joe Biden, the first Catholic vice president and his family. 

A number of cardinals from around the United States were present, including Houston Cardinal Daniel DiNardo. Also in the audience awaiting the Pope's arrival were 10 or 12 Houstonians who had tickets to that event. 

 
The Pope begins today with an official greeting at the White House with the Obamas and 20,000 invited guests. Many of the tickets were handed out early and they will not be scalped as some of the tickets for this mass were scalped. 
There are 20,000 tickets handed out for the mass later this afternoon at the Basilica. The church was not happy that some of them were later sold. 

The question in many people's minds is what now will the Pope say at the White House. Will he talk about hot button issues such as immigration, inequality and maybe even gay rights? The Vatican says this is not a political visit but many are expecting he will wade into political waters. We'll just have to wait till later today to find out. 

Pope Francis in America: Today's Schedule 
8:15am : The Pope will arrive on the south lawn of the White House for an official welcome ceremony and meeting with the president. 
10am : A papal parade will travel along the National Mall as Pope Francis heads to St. Matthew's Cathedral. 
10:30am : The pontiff will pray with bishops of the United States at St. Matthew's Cathedral. 
3:15pm : A mass at the Basilica Confident National Shrine of the Emaculate Conception will begin with the Pope and nearly 30,000 people expected in attendance.

The Strikers put themselves in a powerful position after rallying from a goal down in the final quarter to defeat Western Australia 2-1 on Saturday night in Sydney.

It's also sudden death for the Canberra Lakers, who must beat the highly-ranked Victorian side on Monday to progress to the knockout stages of the men's tournament in Darwin.

The Lakers lost 3-0 to WA on Saturday night and are third in their pool behind WA (six points) and Victoria (three), with Canberra and South Australia level on one point each.

The Strikers are also on three points and are equal second behind NSW (six) and WA (three), with those teams facing each other on Monday in the final pool round.

The Strikers were in danger of being relegated to the consolation rounds trailing WA 1-0 with one quarter to play, but goals to Laura Grey and Catriona Bailey-Price saved the day.

Strikers coach Mark Stafford made a couple of critical tactical changes going into the last quarter that proved to be the difference.

""We stayed in the game right until the end and when it came to crunch time the girls came home really well,"" Stafford said.

""We just changed up a few players, we moved a few players forward that were a few fresh legs and different people up front that threw the opposition out.

""They weren't sure what was coming at them.""

Tasmania is winless from their two games, but Stafford said that didn't mean his team could afford to take them lightly.

""We've got to go out there with the proper mindset, it's another tough game,"" he said.

""They're one of these sides that haven't got that superstar quality, but they've got a good bunch of girls that can play together.

The new triangular shape followed a team visit to the Ngati Toa marae in Wellington during a pre-Rugby World Cup camp. But team members are refusing to reveal the origins of the new arrangement or say what meaning it gives to the electrifying war dance. 

The formation saw captain Richie McCaw at the front of the challenge, with fellow experienced players Kieran Read and Ma'a Nonu behind him and the rest of the team fanning out in rows behind them depending on seniority. 

The formation is reminiscent of the French challenge to the haka in the last World Cup final at Eden Park when the Tricolours formed behind their captain Thierry Dusautoir. 

Asked about the new-look haka, midfielder Conrad Smith declined to reveal details. 

""It's just something we discussed as a team,"" Smith said. ""That's about it. We obviously had a bit of time in New Zealand before we went away and it's something we wanted to do but that's about all I want to say."" 

Lock Brodie Retallick said the new shape was locked in as a change before the All Blacks departed for England. 

""It is something we talked about way back in the camp in Wellington,"" he told Fairfax Media. ""Obviously, we also spent a wee bit of time out at the marae. 

""We thought it was something we would do for this group and it brought us together. So it is the way we will be doing - that is going to be the formation of the haka going forward."" 

Ka Mate was composed by Te Rauparaha of Ngati Toa to commemorate his escape from death during an incident circa the 1820s. The name is simply translated to mean ""it is death, it is death"". 

A pre-game haka is a rugby tradition that dates back to 1888 when the New Zealand Native team performed it during their tour of the UK, and by the ""Original"" All Blacks in 1905. The All Blacks initially performed Ka Mate as pre-match entertainment. 


The Rugby World Cup opener between England and Fiji had more combined viewers in New Zealand than any other match so far, including the All Blacks v Argentina game on Monday morning. 

The Twickenham fixture at 7am on Saturday morning on Sky Sport 1 had 5.5 per cent of all people aged 5 years and older in New Zealand watching, which equates to more than 230,000 viewers. 

Another 4.4 per cent - more than 182,000 viewers - tuned in to the opening game screened live on Prime. 

However, despite being in the early hours of Monday morning, the All Blacks and Argentina game on Sky Sport 1 was the most watched on a single channel - attracting 5.9 per cent between 3.47am and 5.37am. This is more than 247,000 viewers. 

Prime did not have live action of this game but its delayed coverage at midday got 2.1 per cent, which is more than 87,000 people watching the free-to-air coverage. 

The fourth most watched game was a replay of Japan's upset over South Africa at 6.30pm on Sunday night on Sky Sport 1. This had 2.5 per cent, or over 105,000 viewers. 

Other high-viewership games included France v Italy live on Sky Sport 1 on Sunday morning and a replay of All Blacks v Argentina on the same channel at 6.30am on Monday morning. Both received more than 87,000 viewers. 

The figures - sourced from Nielsen TV Audience Measurement - are based on a national audience of 4,200,882. 

Sky Television declined to comment on whether its subscriber numbers had increased because of its broadcasting of the Rugby World Cup. 

Meanwhile, the Guardian reported that ITV figures in Britain peaked at 9.4 million viewers, with an average of 7.8 million, for England's opening match against Fiji at the weekend. This makes it the most watched sporting event in Britain this year. The newspaper reported that more than four in 10 people watching TV at the time were tuned in to the World Cup opener.

The 1935 All Blacks  album will  be auctioned. 

Richie McCaw has  stressed to his players the importance of remembering those who have worn the famed black jersey before them. 

As the All Blacks strive to make history and win consecutive world cups, a timely reminder of the team's  history has surfaced. 

An album remembering the 1935 All Blacks team, which toured Britain and Ireland, is going under the hammer. 

The bound book contains 30 signed, black-and-white portrait photos of every team member who embarked on the gruelling five-month tour. 

The tour, which stretched into 1936 and stopped over in Canada on the way back,  featured 30 matches,  with four tests against England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. 

The inside front cover  shows it once belonged to Mr S. S. Dean and is stamped N.Z. Union ... P.O. Box ... Wellington. It  goes under the hammer at Cordy's Auctioneers in Auckland on October 6, with a  reserve of $850.

The anniversary of New Zealand's worst military catastrophe is being marked near the scene with a rugby game between the New Zealand Defence Force and Belgium. 

The defence team, the Defence Blacks, will play at Zonnebeke, a Belgian town near Tyne Cot cemetery. The World War I cemetery includes the graves of 520 New Zealand soldiers, 322 of them unidentified. A memorial wall at the rear of the 3.5ha cemetery commemorates 1176 New Zealanders who have no known grave and were casualties of conflict on the Western Front. 

The October 3 game has been billed as the Dave Gallaher Memorial Tournament after the captain of the ""Originals"", the national side that toured Britain in 1905-06. 

Gallaher was fatally wounded on October 4, 1917, during the Passchendaele offensive. He was among the 484 New Zealanders cut down in the battle for Broodseinde, which was seen as a ""success"" for the British-led forces. 

Worse was to follow barely a week later. The First Battle of Passchendaele, on October 12, cost the lives of 845 New Zealanders, the blackest day in the country's military history. 

After the Defence Blacks play Belgium on October 3, a memorial ceremony will be held the following day. 

The game comes a week after the Defence Blacks play a French selection in Paris for the Somme Cup.

Alan Purwin picked up his taste for flying early. 

When he was 5, he would perch on a stack of pillows in his father's Cessna so he could see past the instrument panel as the plane rose over the San Fernando Valley. When he was 16, he received his pilot's license. A couple of years later, he was a crop-duster in Indiana. 

When he came back to Los Angeles and started flying for film studios, his aeronautical career took off in earnest. 

Purwin, who staged heart-stopping helicopter chases for the movies and flew life-saving missions for critically ill children, died Sept. 11 in Colombia in the crash of a small plane being used to transport crews for the Tom Cruise movie ""Mena.""He was 54. 

He was in Colombia helping to shoot the film. 

Carlos Berl, a Colombian pilot who was also aboard the twin-engine Piper Aerostar, was killed after takeoff from the colonial town of San Francisco de Antioquia, officials in Colombia told the Associated Press. Jimmy Lee Garland, a pilot from Georgia, was critically injured. It was unclear who was at the controls as the plane flew into bad weather on the short hop through the Andes to Medellin. 

Purwin was the founder, owner and chairman of Helinet, a helicopter service based at Van Nuys Airport. With 18 choppers, Helinet works for TV news programs, does aerial shoots for films and TV, conducts surveillance for law enforcement agencies and flies donated organs to patients in need. 

Sister companies founded or acquired by Purwin were involved in developing new equipment for aerial cinematography, including film shoots from drones. 

""He was the quintessential entrepreneur,"" said Jack Snyder, Helinet's chief operating officer. ""His passion was flying, but he was really able to anticipate trends and new uses for helicopter-related equipment."" 

Purwin worked on more than 100 films, including the ""Transformers"" series, ""Armageddon"" (1998), ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008). In the 2003 remake of ""The Italian Job"", he piloted a chopper that screamed through skyscrapers, skimmed over traffic-jammed streets, raced under a bridge and churned through a tunnel as it chased bad guys driving Mini Coopers in downtown Los Angeles. 

He plotted his stunts meticulously. 

In the tunnel sequence, ""I worked with the city on removing the vapor lights…and then I got the effects guys to bring in a huge fan driven by a Chevy engine,"" he told The Times in 2005. ""I wanted the whole ceiling and the rafters blown out to see if there was anything loose that would come down and go into the rotor blades and cause a problem."" 

With all that done, Purwin had a small, powerful, maneuverable chopper trucked down the tunnel and wheeled in. ""Then I had somebody rotating the blades so I could measure how much width I had. Once I determined it was all feasible, we kind of just laid out a plan and I went into it very cautiously."" 

Snyder, Purwin's colleague at Helinet, said the helicopter chases in ""The Italian Job"" were among the pilot's most iconic work. 

""He loved the creativity, the ability to help directors realize their vision,"" Snyder said. ""He liked the camaraderie on the set. Honestly, when he'd come back from being out filming, I didn't think I'd ever see him happier."" 

Born Aug. 28, 1961, Alan David Purwin grew up in North Hollywood. His father owned an auto repair business and flew a Cessna 182, which he owned with several friends, for enjoyment. He also volunteered to transport patients for a medical charity.

Ever since Ben Huntsman tragically drowned at a Central American pool party his family has been inundated with well-wishes from his friends around the world.

Dozens of Facebook profiles have changed to include the 28-year-old's image, ceremonies have been held in various countries and the calls, texts and visitors keep flooding in.

""The reaction had been phenomenal,"" his mother Mary Dunkley-Allport said.

""It's been quite overwhelming. We didn't fully understand the extent of his influence.""

The exact circumstances surrounding Mr Huntsman's August 30 death in Nicaragua remain in part a mystery and may never be known.

He was on a ""Sunday Funday"" pool party crawl in coastal San Juan del Sur, a popular surfing spot. 

Similar to a pub crawl, during the pool party crawl party-goers are bussed to three hotels with pools and bars.

""We know that his death was accidental by drowning,"" Ms Dunkley-Allport said.

""It is Nicaragua, it is the party capital of the world, and he was found drowned in one of the Sunday Funday pools."" 

Ms Dunkley-Allport said there was no evidence of physical injury or foul play.

Mr Huntsman had been staying at one of the crawl's hotels, The Naked Tiger, but did not die in its pool.

Ms Dunkley-Allport said she didn't blame any of the hotels or organisers of the crawl for his death, calling it a ""misadventure"".

""Benjamin didn't have an angry bone in his body. Holding animosity doesn't bring him back,"" she said.

""It's 350 20-something-year-olds at a pool crawl. But it shouldn't have happened and we don't know how it happened, because Ben is street smart.""

Ms Dunkley-Allport said her son's popularity was due to his inclusiveness.

He was friends with people from all walks of life, races and ages, and would organise events and parties to bring them all together.

""He had an effusive, gregarious personality,"" she said.

""He had a beautiful eccentricity. He had silly dress-ups and he came in and started sing, and got everybody singing for no apparent reason.""

His love of meeting new friends and partying took Mr Huntsman all over the world, including multiple trips to Asia and Europe and his final dream trip to Latin America.

He also channelled his boundless energy into his job as a chef, where he had success helping to set up Chew Burger, named as one of the top 10 new burger joints by The Age last year.

Mr Huntsman had a ""unique life"" with his five siblings living between Echuca and Surrey Hills, commuting during the week to attend Kingswood College.

Ms Dunkley-Allport said the family was now focused on his repatriation so they could hold a funeral planned for 3pm on Wednesday at Hawthorn Town Hall.

882848,316989bf-63ad-4241-82dd-0bf9e03d3a01,The Alternative Ending of John Boehner,Views from the Hill,"October 31st marks the ending day of John Boehner’s time in the House of Representatives. His career spanned almost twenty-five years, cumulating in his rise to Speaker of the House five years ago. It was widely reported that having the Pope speak to an open session of Congress was a personal, 20 year quest of Boehner, and that, combined with the stress of trying to corral his wild and unprincipled Republican colleagues was enough for him to throw in the towel and retire at 67. This is particularly a partial win for him, because of the implied promise of no government shutdown at the end of this week with his resignation. I have another theory. Boehner is a sincerely religious man, and has a deep and abiding faith in his Catholicism, and has won many public service awards for his unfailing stands against abortion. As part of Pope Francis’ visit to Congress, Boehner arranged a private, one-on-one visit with the Holy See, the contents of which have not been made public or hinted at. What if John Boehner had an attack of consciousness? The Pope is recognized for being a candid and outspoken leader in the fight for equality and compassion for the poor. He believes it is everyone’s duty to extend a helping hand to those below them on the economic ladder, and even skipped a lunch with political leaders to meet with street people and the poor. Consider this: What if during their private meeting Pope Francis, noted for his frankness,  figuratively called him out for living a misguided life? I can imagine a conversation where Francis confronted Boehner, asking if he believed his role here on earth was to aid the moneychangers? Further, the Pontiff might ask if he really felt that he was following his christian upbringing by working for the super wealthy on the backs of women, mothers and young children? Shouldn’t Boehner be using his role as a leader to help the poor, the homeless, and the hungry? Couldn’t he be doing more with his life than he had so far? Boehner could have taken this entire conversation to heart, as an awakening and acknowledgement, both to Francis and himself, that he had time left to change, and would begin immediately. Boehner himself changed course quickly after his resignation announcement. During an emotional interview on Face the Nation, when asked if the hard-liners were unrealistic, “Absolutely they’re unrealistic,” he said. “But the Bible says beware of false prophets. And there are people out there spreading noise about how much can get done. I mean, this whole ideas that we are going to shut down government to get rid of Obamacare in 2013, this plan never had a chance.” Boehner even voiced an opinion that those far-right super conservatives did not want to change Washington, they were out to destroy it. I don’t see him being so outspoken without having had an epiphany immediately beforehand. There is deep fear that chaos will reign with Boehner’s departure, and that a Republican who promised they could govern when installed in office in 2014, are clearly on a path of self-destruction, at least as seen by the adults in the room. The next speaker will be forced even further right than Boehner ever was. Perhaps to his credit and old line sensibilities when it comes to how government should run, Boehner suddenly grew a heart, realized that what he was doing and where he was heading was not his purpose in life, and wisely chose to move on. Never a fan of John Boehner and his methods, I, at least, would feel much better about him if this is a closer approximation of what went on last week behind closed doors.    ",623,"government shutdown at the end of this week with his resignation.

444540,33318f39-8dd9-40b5-9a2d-4e9c6c2265b6,Judge orders officers charged in Freddie Gray case to be tried separately,South Florida Sun-Sentinel,"A judge on Wednesday ordered that six Baltimore Police officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray be tried separately. 

The ruling was one of three that Judge Barry Williams handed down during the first pre-trial motions hearing in the case. Williams earlier denied defense motions to dismiss charges against the officers and to recuse State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby's office from the case. 

Prosecutors argued to have the six officers tried in groups, while defense attorneys had argued their clients should be tried separately. 

Defense attorneys had sought to have the charges against their clients dismissed due to prosecutorial misconduct, and for Mosby and other prosecutors in the State's Attorney's office to be recused from the case because of alleged conflicts of interest. 

They argued that Mosby had gone too far in her remarks when she publicly announced charges against the officers on May 1. But while Judge Barry Williams said while he found some of Mosby's remarks ""troubling,"" he said they did not prevent the officers from receiving a fair trial. 

Defense attorneys cited alleged conflicts of interest that they said required Mosby's office to be recused from the case. On that motion, Williams said the defense ""didn't come close"" to justifying a removal of the prosecutors' office. 

A second pre-trial motions hearing is scheduled for Sept. 10, when the sides are scheduled to argue a defense motion to move the trial out of Baltimore. 

Gray, 25, suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody on April 12 and died from his injuries a week later. The six police officers were indicted on charges ranging from second-degree depraved heart murder to misconduct in office. 

Andrew Graham, a defense attorney for Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., argued that when Mosby publicly announced the charges against the officers on May 1, she ""adopted and encouraged the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace,'"" and that her statements tainted the jury pool. 

""She handled this as though it was some sort of pep rally,"" Graham told Williams. 

Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow said Mosby's comments were taken directly from a statement of charges and that Williams should consider the words she spoke and not accept the defense's ""gross distortion of what she said."" He said any effort to calm the unrest throughout the city served a ""legitimate"" law enforcement purpose. 

Catherine Flynn, a defense attorney for Officer Garrett E. Miller, argued for the recusal of Mosby and repeated arguments made in written motions that prosecutors in Mosby's office became witnesses in the case through their independent investigation of Gray's death. 

She said the court should decide on the issue prior to allowing the case to go to trial. Schatzow argued that prosecutors had no conflicts of interest, noting prosecutors regularly perform investigative tasks. 

""None of these conflicts represent real conflicts that require recusal of anyone, let alone the entire State's Attorney's Office,"" he said. 

Williams, who at times cut off both the defense attorneys and prosecutors arguing their points, raised questions about statements made by Mosby made, including when she answered a reporter's question about whether the police officers had cooperated with the investigation. 

""It's inappropriate, and you know it,"" Williams said to Schatzow about that exchange. 

But in his ruling, Williams said it was not within his authority to decide whether she had broken the Maryland Lawyer's Rules of Professional Conduct, which guide attorney behavior. That was for the Attorney Grievance commission to decide, he said. 

The judge also said defense claims of conflicts of interests by Mosby and other prosecutors ""didn't come close"" to meriting their removal from the case. Williams called the alleged conflict based on Mosby's husband, Nick Mosby, serving as a City Councilman in the district where Gray was arrested ""troubling and condescending."" 

At the conclusion of his remarks, Williams told attorneys to stop seeking media sound bites and making unsupported claims. 

A gathering of media and sign-toting protesters began to form outside the courthouse around 8 a.m. -- an anticipated scene surrounding a case that has garnered international attention following rioting and unrest in the weeks following Gray's death. 

Protesters began moving downtown toward the Inner Harbor area of downtown Baltimore with arms linked. At least one person was arrested. Protesters then headed north to Baltimore's police headquarters. 

Goodson, the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder. Sgt. Alicia D. White, Lt. Brian W. Rice and Officer William G. Porter are charged with manslaughter. Officers Edward M. Nero and Garrett E. Miller face lesser charges, including second-degree assault. 

The officers have all pleaded not guilty. They waived their rights to attend Wednesday's hearing. Gray's family was also not expected to attend, according to their attorney. 

Following Gray's death, peaceful protests against police brutality were staged across the city. But on the day of Gray's funeral on April 27, students and other residents began clashing with police officers near Mondawmin Mall, and portions of the city quickly spiraled into rioting, looting and arson. 

More than 100 police officers were injured and more than 400 businesses were damaged amid the rioting, which prompted Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake to institute a curfew and Gov. Larry Hogan to deploy the National Guard. Mosby announced charges against the officers on May 1, and they were later indicted by a grand jury. 
 
Police have been preparing for the hearing by meeting with business leaders and law enforcement counterparts from agencies across the Baltimore region. They also canceled leave for officers on Wednesday and on Sept. 10, when a second hearing is scheduled on the defense motion to have the case moved out of Baltimore because of the tremendous amount of exposure it has had in the city. 

Prior to the hearing resuming at 2 p.m. Wednesday, East Baltimore resident Malcolm Wilson, 23 said he's pleased by the judge's ruling not to recuse Mosby and not to drop charges against the officers. 

""It's a step in the right direction,"" he said, calling it ""a move to keep the city calm."" 

Wilson said he knew Gray personally. He clutched a white cardboard sign that read, ""I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray."" 

He said he's less concerned about whether the officers will be tried separately, but said he is worried about a later motions hearing to decide whether the case should be moved to another jurisdiction.

NILES — A Berrien Springs man accused of stabbing his roommate in June has been found incompetent to stand trial -- at least for now. 

Thomas James Jones, 21, is charged with assault with intent to murder and assault with a dangerous weapon in the stabbing of Jahad Glaze in the chest during an argument on June 19. Glaze was treated at Lakeland Medical Center in St. Joseph for a stab wound to the chest. 

A forensic examination was ordered for Jones in late June by Berrien County Trial Judge Dennis Wiley. Tuesday, Wiley read portions of the report into the record and then ruled him incompetent to stand trial at present. 

Assistant Prosecutor Amy Byrd said the next step will be for Jones to get medical treatment for his mental health problems with the Center for Forensic Psychiatry making periodic updates to the court about his progress. 

Jones could be found competent to stand trial if he is able to understand the charges against him and assist in his own defense after treatment. If treatment doesn't result in his being found competent, he could enter a not guilty by reason of insanity plea and be placed in a mental institution. 

Wiley noted Tuesday that the doctor examining Jones found him to be ""actively psychotic"" at the present time. The examiner said Jones has a history of mental health problems and had received treatment earlier this year at both Memorial Hospital in South Bend and the Riverwood center in St. Joseph. 

The examiner reported that Jones exhibited delusional thoughts and inappropriate behavior such as laughing and spitting at the wrong times and mumbling to himself. Jones has had a history of threatening others, the examiner added.",293,"Wiley read portions of the report into the record and then ruled him incompetent to stand trial at present.

Boyd, president and chief executive officer, commented, ""The summer months are when we plan and prepare for the next ski season. This summer has been no different, with activity on many fronts. Most significant has been the continued progress at Mount Snow.

""As we announced in late August, we have received investor commitments to fully subscribe the $52 million EB-5 capital raise for Mount Snow with $50.8 million in escrow as of September 4, 2015. In addition, the construction work that began this summer on the West Lake project component is proceeding well. Further, we continue to expect approval of the first I-526 Petition in the near future, which will allow the release of the funds in escrow.""

Boyd added, ""Earlier this summer, we also created a new Sales and Marketing group for our Northeast Resorts. This group will allow us to leverage our multiple resort presence, which we believe will increase our overall sales in the region. Across the resort portfolio, we continue to work to make certain the ski experience remains top quality, with maintenance capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 expected to be in the range of $5 million to $6 million (exclusive of the West Lake project), about $1.4 million of which was spent in the first quarter. Our resort teams are making certain everything remains in tip top shape following our $59.5 million in infrastructure investments in recent years, in particular in new snowmaking technology.

""Overall, we are excited to be implementing our roadmap for growth, which calls for a mix of organic growth, resort development and acquisitions. We continue to evaluate potential value-add acquisitions.""

Three-Month Resort Operating Results 

Stephen J. Mueller, Peak Resorts' chief financial officer, noted, ""Total revenue and resort operating expenses both declined slightly in the first quarter. Through July 31, higher revenue from the zipline rider attraction at the Attitash resort did not offset lower food and beverage revenue related to the termination of a restaurant lease at our Big Boulder resort in March 2015.

""The zipline at Attitash is proving to be a popular attraction. We expect it to continue to attract visitors through the fall as it gives riders a great view of the Mount Washington Valley from high above the tree canopy. We expect a strong contribution from the zipline to our second-quarter revenue.""

Financial Position Supports Strategy 

Mueller noted, ""The strength of our balance sheet at year end has allowed us to continue to implement our strategic plan during the summer months when our cash receipts are typically lower. At July 31, 2015, we had $11.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $16.8 million at April 30, 2015, reflecting normal operating cash flow, the investment we are making at Mount Snow in advance of the release of the EB-5 funds held in escrow, as well as dividend and interest payments totaling $4.7 million.""

Richard K. Deutsch, vice president, business and real estate development, added, ""As previously announced, we have moved ahead with the development plan at our Mount Snow ski resort, breaking ground in May 2015 for Phase 1 – the West Lake project. The West Lake Project continues in full swing, with over 10 miles of pipe installed so far this construction season. The excavation of the physical West Lake is now 60% complete.As we have reported, we are very pleased with the interest in and success of our EB-5 program, which will finance this work. When we closed the program in August, we had investor commitments to provide all of the funding and we now have in escrow $50.8 million of the $52 million raised.""

Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures 

Reported EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The company defines Reported EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, gain on sale/leaseback, investment income, other income or expense and other non-recurring items. The following table includes a reconciliation of Reported EBITDA to net loss:

We have chosen to specifically include Reported EBITDA as a measurement of our results of operations because we consider this measurement to be a significant indication of our financial performance and available capital resources. Because of large depreciation and other charges relating to our ski resorts, it is difficult for management to fully and accurately evaluate our financial results and available capital resources using net income. Management believes that by providing investors with Reported EBITDA, investors will have a clearer understanding of our financial performance and cash flow because Reported EBITDA: (i) is widely used in the ski industry to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary by company primarily based upon the structure or existence of their financing; (ii) helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating structure; and (iii) is used by our management for various purposes, including as a measure of performance of our operating entities and as a basis for planning.

Items excluded from Reported EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance or liquidity. Reported EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternative to, or substitute for, net income, net change in cash and cash equivalents or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Reported EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, Reported EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

His visit will mark a number of historic firsts, including holding mass on U.S. soil (Washington, D.C., New York City and Philadelphia), as well as canonizing the first Hispanic saint, which will also be the first canonization in America. It is also his first time visiting America in his life, which will include a visit to a correctional facility. It is one of his first stops that will be most politically interesting, especially for those on the Religious Right. At the invitation of Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), Pope Francis became the first Pope to address a joint session of Congress on Thursday. While there was much speculation as to what he would speak on, though his flurry of encyclicals over the past two years were an excellent preview. From climate change to inequality, Pope Francis made it very clear that the way to correct the world’s ills is to take care of the weakest among us. The Pope had an audience of not only Congress, but four Supreme Court Justices, which included three of the six Catholic justices. As politics goes in America, most of the elected officials got to Congress by professing their deep faith in a Christian religion that professes to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. Like all of these denominations, Catholicism has a different interpretation on what it means to follow those teachings. However, unlike the majority of those sitting in the chamber, Pope Francis believes in walking the walk. The current leader of the Catholic Church has been noted for his subtle and not so subtle attempts to move the church into modern times. He has suggested that there are reasons for marriages to end, even though the church has long been against divorce. He has also suggested a more welcoming approach to gays and lesbians, even possible support for civil unions. Perhaps his boldest statement came in a papal encyclical which urged Catholics to make safeguarding the environment and climate change an urgent priority. A champion of the poor, Pope Francis sees capitalism as not only harming the earth, but also humankind. Conservative Republicans have long fought against climate change, believing that the earth and her people should put their faith in, well, faith. During his speech, the Pope emphasized that this was not the way, saying that “This common good also includes the earth.” The Pope has also put the Catholic community on notice that they should open their churches to the Syrian refugees currently flooding the borders of several European countries. Here in the United States, Republicans have taken a harsh stance against immigration, including removing undocumented families from the country, and building walls at the border to protect the xenophobic interests of their base. While President Obama has said he would be open to taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees, Republicans warn of terrorists among the ranks of the traumatized men, women and children who have suffered under years of conflict. The Pope reminded Congress that this was a nation of immigrants. He noted that thousands of people travel north to in search of better opportunities. He urged America to treat them as people and “To respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal.” It is the Pope’s message as a champion of the poor that will test the faith of most in Congress. Inequality has reached unprecedented levels in the past two decades, and the millionaires that make up the bulk of Congress have done little to stem the tide. The Pope reminded the crowd that has continually cut programs that help the elderly, the poor and the young that they must they must include these groups in the common good. They need to share the wealth, instead of, for example, denying healthcare to people who can’t afford it under the auspices of individuality that favors the wealthy. Pope Francis also addressed the nation that is the world leader of incarcerated people and one of the only industrialized countries that still uses the death penalty. He used a phrase popular with the anti-choice crowd but did not refer to abortion. Instead, he called for the abolition of the death penalty. “I am convinced,” he said, “that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.” The Pope is not a political official. His stances on the issues affecting our world come from a faith-based moral perspective of compassion. To be fair, the Catholic Church has not become a sudden bastion of liberal thought under his leadership, as its stances on gay marriage, abortion, women as priests and the continual scandal of sexual abuse by priests show. Yet, in America, his focus on the morality of the effects of climate change, inequality and helping those fleeing from war is a political statement. In the end, the “People’s Pope” reminded the government for the people, by the people, and of the people why they were sitting in that chamber: “Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been invited, called and convened by those who elected you.” In other words, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. LOVE THIS?

It might be the sort of thing that only bands and people who are paid to write about music would notice, but crowd safety and comfort has become quite the issue in the last year or so. But very few bands are actually doing much about it beyond occasionally shouting down/standing up to unruly fans or saying that it really sucks when fans don’t feel safe. 
 
Not so with Massachusetts fuzz-rockers Speedy Ortiz. They’re rolling out a help hotline for fans to call if they feel unsafe at their shows supporting their new album,  Foil Deer . 
 

 
The hotline allows fans to text the band directly with their name and where they are in the venue, so that security can be alerted and sent to help. 
 
Frontwoman Sadie Dupuis took to Twitter to talk about the new system, and no-so-subtly suggest that other bands should try something similar. 
   
This help hotline is a new system we're trying out, but one we hope will make our shows a lot safer & more fun for all. We love you folks. 
 
— sadie dupuis (@sad13) September 7, 2015 
 
   
sometimes as a showgoer i've felt unsafe & didn't know what to do. as a performer i've always have an easier time getting security's ear 
 
— sadie dupuis (@sad13) September 7, 2015 
 
   
i'm hoping we can leverage our privilege as performers to help keep our friends in the crowd safer. we'll see how it goes but i'm optimistic

and if this hotline help system does seem to work, we hope other bands will set them up too. hint hint ;)

We'll probably never understand what this guy was thinking as he decided his best move involved breaking through metal barricades (possibly while intoxicated) before being tackled by security; apparently ""security"" used more force than necessary during the altercation because here we now sit watching video footage capturing it all going wrong right from our computer screens......(scroll over & click play on embedded player below). We have some questions too regarding why didn t sound check started earlier i mean one couldn read off list until after 2pm! Also thought festival organizors took no chances concerning stage height even though audience sits lower level seats were situated higher tier location seemed rather close together especially those within sections furthest away behind us perhaps could been improved upon plus wouldn include separate VIP section altogether which always creates division amongst general public thus giving opportunity attend special events etc.....it just doesnt fit well fitting both needs simultaneously making","While it may be a small issue, crowd safety and comfort have become significant concerns for bands and music writers.

877407,d9e901b8-e9aa-48fb-8b72-71265890e967,"Orca Gold: High Grade Intercepts From Liseiwi Prospect, Block 14",Market Pulse Navigator,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 -- . (TSX VENTURE: ORG) (""Orca"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce a new discovery on its Block 14 mineral licence in Sudan. 

The focus of exploration in 2015 has been to identify and develop new targets that will add additional satellite resources to the Galat Sufar South (GSS) deposit. Based on a successful trenching and channel sampling programme carried out in Q2 2015 and first pass drilling at Prospect NE, a 5,000m reverse circulation (RC) drill campaign was commenced in mid-August to test four new prospects. 

The Liseiwi Prospect (Figure 1) located 58km north east of GSS is the first prospect to be drilled in this drill campaign. Drilling is targeting channel sampling results from a large area of artisanal workings. These channels returned a number of significant intercepts including 20m at 1.76g/t, 30m at 1.27g/t and 28m at 1.27g/t from the northern end of the workings and up to 38m at 6.51g/t (uncut) / 4.38g/t (cut to 10g/t) from a cross cutting high grade zone at the southern end of the workings. 

11 RC holes have been completed in this first drilling campaign at Liseiwi. Assays have been received for the first 6 holes and are detailed below and shown in Figure 2: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Au g/t Au g/t Hole Type From To Metres Uncut Cut to 10g/t ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC592 RC No significant Intercept ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC593 RC 11 14 3 0.95 0.95 --------------------------------------------------------------- 17 20 3 0.95 0.95 --------------------------------------------------------------- 30 50 20 1.48 1.48 --------------------------------------------------------------- 60 63 3 1.33 1.33 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC594 RC 67 77 10 2.68 2.68 --------------------------------------------------------------- 82 85 3 2.08 2.08 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC595 RC 0 24 24 3.89 2.13 --------------------------------------------------------------- 65 68 3 5.20 4.33 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC596 RC 38 48 10 15.32 7.40 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- GSRC598 RC 30 45 15 2.46 2.38 --------------------------------------------------------------- 49 53 4 0.53 0.53 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: Due to the preliminary nature of the drilling, true widths have not yet been calculated. 

Mineralisation at Liseiwi is contained within a fine grained andesite host with disseminated and vein pyrite and silicification over a strike length of 125m. The strike remains open in all directions. 

Further results are expected in the next few weeks. However, with the success at this first Prospect a follow up program is being prepared, with the objective of increasing the Block 14 resource base. 

Drilling at Prospect P, the second target of this current campaign, located 9km south of the GSS resource (Figure 1), will commence shortly. Trenching at Prospect P, over a strike length of 600m, returned values including 22m at 0.45g/t, 12m at 1.55g/t, 20m at 0.57g/t and 20m at 1.81g/t. Mineralization at Prospect P is hosted by a deformed, felsic dyke intruding carbonate sediments. 

The other two Prospects to be drilled in this campaign are Prospect M and Prospect NE, both located within 200 metres of the main resource at GSS (Figure 3). 

At Prospect M recent trenching has returned 42m at 1.64g/t and 18m at 2.46g/t. At Prospect NE first pass drilling in 2014 returned results of 19m at 6.04/3.91g/t and 18m at 3.32g/t. 

Commenting on the results, Hugh Stuart, President and CEO, said, ""These first results from Liseiwi confirm our view of the potential for Block 14 to host numerous high grade deposits in addition to the current resources at GSS and Wadi Doum. We continue to be excited by the upside at Block 14, with new areas of artisanal activity being opened up and assessed by Orca geologists on an ongoing basis. We are also building a strong technical understanding of mineralization controls towards identifying new targets outside of artisanal areas. We believe we have only scratched the surface at Block 14."" 

Orca has defined a Mineral Resource at the Galat Sufar South Prospect (""GSS"") (News Release: February 4, 2015) comprising an Indicated Resource of 26.4Mt grading 1.77g/t for 1.50 million ounces of gold and an Inferred Resource of 8.7Mt grading 1.7g/t for an additional 0.0.48 million ounces. 

In addition, an initial resource has been defined at a satellite target Wadi Doum (News Release: February 4, 2015), 55km east of GSS comprising 1.30Mt grading 3.02g/t for 0.13million ounces of gold and an Inferred Resource of 1.63Mt grading 2.2g/t for an additional 0.12 million ounces. 

At the end of Q2/2015 Orca had $CAD 22.3 million in its treasury.

136039,1216fb08-ad50-40e3-a55d-9a9bfd6461f6,Adventures with Larry & Caleb: What are the Pros and Cons of Vocational Ministry?,the upstream collective,"Upstream co-founders, Larry McCrary ( @LarryMcCrary @LarryMcCrary ) and Caleb Crider ( @calebcrider ) are living in very different places: for Larry, Madrid, Spain; for Caleb, Richmond, Virginia. Along with their families they’re not just teaching  Tradecraft  missionary skills, they’re also applying them. So we wanted to tap into their unique experiences, and at the same time parallel their local and global perspectives. So “Adventures with Larry and Caleb” will be an ongoing series throughout the year where we ask them one mission-related question at a time. Here’s the question for this month’s episode: 
 What are the pros and cons of vocational ministry?  
Larry McCrary 
 
The North American church naturally celebrates the word ‘missionary’ and anyone sent out to be one. In some cases, being a missionary raises your status level in the Evangelical church world. It’s subtly reflected when we say that “ordinary” people can also live overseas with missional importance. Why are they “ordinary”? Because we see them as secondary to a vocational missionary. More than ever before, this is simply not true. 
 
What in the world are you doing in my country? 
 
I was once asked this many years ago while serving overseas. It’s a question that’s often posed to overseas workers who call themselves missionaries. And it can create an intense crisis. In many parts of the world, governments and people are not very open to having Christian missionaries. In other places you may enter as a vocational missionary, but it’s a term that most people will misunderstand. They may feel that missionaries are those who are sent to poor regions in the world to provide relief. Others may be more cynical and feel that missionaries are religious radicals who sabotage cultures. 
 
I see three challenges as a vocational missionary: 
  Their  Identity may create tension. This begins in the hearts of the missionaries themselves. On both formal and informal bases they must articulate who they are and what they’re doing. This may form an issue of conscience, especially if they can’t be fully honest (such as pointing to a platform or project that they actually don’t maintain). In addition, nationals can see when someone is posing, which leads to suspicion more than curiosity. Some missionaries in such circumstances have even been accused of being spies.  Their  Credibility may not be high. In post- or non-Christian contexts many people will not welcome them as a missionary (i.e. religious fanatic or cultural saboteur) nor as a poser (i.e. spy). Credibility is the gateway to relationship, and relationship is the gateway to sharing the gospel. Without it they may not get to the first conversation, and certainly not beyond it. And to the extent that the missionary lacks credibility among the people, Jesus lacks credibility.  Their  Accessibility to the people they want to reach may be limited. Though they have more time for language acquisition and relationship-building, they can’t consistently rub shoulders with people who are busy at work. For example, I have a heart to see urban professionals follow Jesus, but vocational missionaries can’t really access the core of that population segment. However, the good news is that over 6,000,000 North Americans live abroad and have natural access to the people they work with. The Christians among them are an army of potential missionaries.   
Caleb Crider 
 
Typically, a missionary is someone who is paid (through fundraising or full-time pay) to move to a different land and make disciples of the people there. Folks who choose this model of missionary service tend to pursue theological education in preparation, and often subject themselves to emotional, spiritual, and strategic evaluation in an attempt to establish their preparedness for life on the field. This “mission as career” approach to mission frees the sent-one from having to find and maintain regular work, allowing him instead to focus his time and efforts upon the work of ministry. At first glance, this might seem like the best way–even the only way–to  be a missionary. 
 
Many Christ-followers are now beginning to explore their part in God’s mission. These are bank tellers, teachers, students, web developers, and claims adjusters who feel as though the decision to become a missionary requires them to leave their jobs, raise funds, and go. This false understanding couldn’t be further from he truth. The “career missionary” model simply isn’t the only (or the best) way to go and make disciples among the peoples of the earth. 
 
Firstly, it is not sustainable. The thousands of missionaries currently serving around the world require millions of dollars in financial support each year. Whether it’s due to limited resources or apathy on the part of sending churches, we simply don’t have the the money to send all of the people that need to go. 
 
Secondly is the question of access. When a worker quits his or her job to become a “missionary,” they also leave behind the “backstage pass” that would allow them to enter a new culture. “Career missionary” isn’t something the people and governments of other countries welcome; doctors, entrepreneurs, carpenters, and social workers, on the other hand, are welcomed in many parts of the world. For someone with a “regular job” to move to a new place on God’s mission may be more complicated, but it puts the believer into a position to build strong relationships and to model for local people what their lives would look like in Christ. 
 
Now, this isn’t an argument against fully-funded church planters living abroad. We need “career missionaries”! But we cannot allow these missionaries to be the only missionaries. In 1 Corinthians 9:3-18 we read Paul’s teaching on the subject. As a bivocational missionary, Paul makes the argument that churches should provide financially for some of those that they send. But throughout Acts, we see Paul using his trade to earn a living while making disciples in the marketplace. Paul is a good example for those who are contemplating missionary service today: your willingness to go comes first; your mode of service is a secondary question that doesn’t necessarily involve leaving the workforce. 
 
In the end, churches desperately need to separate the role of missionary from the career of “missionary.” Only when we understand the sent-ness of all of God’s people and the need for creative approaches to sending and maintaining people on mission will we truly be able to be obedient to Christ’s command to go.",1061,"of vocational ministry?

""The good old days"": When I first got involved as president four years ago September seemed late.

ForeWord Digital Review 
 “Given the enormous and increasing budget cuts facing these historically tax-supported programs, this epidemic of homelessness forces us to care for one another in creative ways that are unprecedented in recent memory. For this pressing reason, Levy’s book presents a pretreatment model for action that is becoming necessary reading as narrative for improving policy, supervision, and outreach counseling services for the most vulnerable among us.” 
 
-Pamela Harris Kaiser –  ForeWord Review  of Homeless Narratives & Pretreatment Pathways 
 
Health Care for the Homeless  Review 
Levy crafts stories of characters who sear the memory: Old Man Ray, the World War 2 veteran who resents the VA system and regards himself as the de facto night watchman at Port Authority; Ben who claims to be a prophet disowned in his own country, crucified by the government and enslaved by poverty finds a bridge to the mainstream services and a path to housing through the common language of religious metaphors, including redemption and forgiveness; and Andrew who has been “mentally murdered” is helped to understand his own situation and gain disability benefits through the language of trauma; among others. 
 
These stories are deftly interwoven with theory and practice as Levy constructs his developmental model of the engagement and pretreatment process. The outreach worker strives to understand the language and the culture of each homeless individual, builds a bridge to the mainstream services, and helps those providers to understand the special circumstances of these vulnerable people. Levy bears witness to the courage of these pilgrims who wander the streets of our cities, and his poignant book is a testament to the healing power of trusting and enduring relationships.

According to an official statement from Qihoo, the company has a put option to sell its entire stake in the joint venture to Coolpad at a total price equal to twice its fair market value, exercisable if Coolpad breaches its non-compete obligations under the shareholders agreement. 
 
The company also proposed a fair market value of $742.5 million USD for the 49.5% stake, based on a US$1.5 billion valuation of the entire share capital of the joint venture. Accordingly, the purchase price payable by Coolpad would be $1.485 billion USD. 
 
The start of this messy breakup can be traced back to Dec. 2014, when the two firms set up a joint venture to focus on mobile terminal products distributed through Internet channels. Qihoo has invested $409.05 million USD for a 45% stake in joint venture and then increased its stake to 49.5% gradually. 
 
Six months later, however, Qihoo has seen its partner turning favor toward a direct competitor LeTV, which became the second largest shareholder of Coolpad by purchasing an 18 percent stake in the company. 
 
Qihoo claimed the agreement with Coolpad specified that Qiku will oversee smartphone production and Coolpad will be responsible for sharing resources in retailing channels and cooperation with telecom carriers. Yet, Coolpad circumvented the agreement through partnership with LeTV and give its competitor access to Qiku’s IP and research capabilities. 
 
Coolpad’s partnership with LeTV have enraged Zhou who responded the news with a resentful WeChat status “Whoever stabbed me in the back to screw me up, my principle is that I will definitely fuck back.” 
 
Several elements have soured the once sweet cooperation between Qihoo and Coolpad. The joint venture started with a dual-brand strategy to focus on different user groups—Dashen on 1,000 RMB budget smartphone market and Qiku on mid-and high-tier markets. 
 
But the two partners are going separate ways as Zhou Hongyi, the CEO of Qihoo, gives more priority to businesses related to Qiku smartphone and Coolpad’s team for Dashen. Although Coolpad is still the controlling shareholder of the joint venture, Qihoo is seeking ways to become the largest shareholding through various means, according to a people close to the matter . 
 
Qihoo responded that they did not excise the option immediately after Coolpad-LeTV tie-up in hopes that further negotiation may settle the matter. But months of talk wasn’t quite productive. 
 
If Coolpad refuses to purchase 49.5% stake, it is highly possible that Qihoo may offer to acquire the remaining stakes in the joint venture. The issuance of this notice might help Qihoo to extract better bargains.

Earlier rumors that the move was related to the non-compete issue turned out false as the two parties did eventually reach an agreement and doubled the frequency of the joint venture’s board meetings.

Comedian Damon Wayans has attacked the alleged victims of Bill Cosby as ""un-rapeable"" and branded them ""bitches"" taking part in a ""money hustle"".

Wayans made the comments during an extensive interview on the nationally syndicated New York 105.1 Breakfast Club show.

Wayans, know for his appearances on Saturday Night Live, In Living Color and My Wife And Kids, was asked what advice he had for 78-year-old Cosby, who . ""If I was him I would divorce my wife, wink wink, and then I would go do a deposition,"" said Wayans. ""I would light on of them three-hour cigars and have me some wine and maybe a Quaalude and I would just go off because I don't believe he was raping.

""I think he was in relationships with all of them and then he was like, 'It's 78 and, know what, it don't work any more. I can't get it up with any of y'all. Bye, bitches' And they are like, 'Oh, really. Rape!'""

He also questioned the timing of Cosby's accusers.

""I mean how big is his penis that it gives you amnesia for 40 years?"" he said, adding: ""And some of them, really, is unrapeable. I look at them and go, 'No, he don't want that. Get outta here!'""

Wayans' extraordinary comments were met with hilarity and apparent approval from hosts DJ Envy (Raashaun Casey) and Charlamagne Tha God (Lenard McKelvey), while the third presenter, Angela Yee, appeared less comfortable with the rant.

Later in the interview, Wayans appeared to soften his stance, saying, ""My heart goes out to anybody who was raped by Bill Cosby. I'm sorry and I hope you get justice"", before seeming once again to condemn the victims.

Twitter was swift in its condemnation of Wayans.

The ex-shadow business secretary also said immigrants have to do more to integrate with the local community, claiming it is ""crazy"" for someone who has been in the country for 30 years not to speak English. 
  Chuka Umunna pulled out of the Labour leadership race days after announcing he would stand, and has refused to join Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet   
He said Labour must recognise concerns about welfare, including acknowledging some people try to ""rinse"" the system. 

			 
At a fringe event at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Mr Umunna - whose father was a Nigerian immigrant - said: ""Immigration clearly has been an issue that our movement hasn't felt terribly comfortable talking about. Actually, I don't think we should have an inhibition about talking about immigration at all."" 



 
He said some recent migrants from Somalia, Eritrea and Eastern Europe are ""living parallel lives"" and not mixing with local communities. 

""My view is that integration is a two-way street. Both the settled, existing population and newcomers have a responsibility,"" he said. 

""I do think it is crazy that we do have first generation immigrants in our country who have been here for 20 or 30 years who can't speak English."" 

Being able to speak English helps ""barriers break down"" and can take some of the ""toxicity"" out of the issue, he said. 

			 
But Mr Umunna warned: ""The idea that we should in any way buy into the narrative that says 'immigrants are responsible for all of our people's problems' and go down any avenue which seeks to set up different groups against each other, we should have a firm line that we are not going anywhere near that at all."" 

In a sign that Labour has to ""meet the public where they are at"", Mr Umunna said: ""We have got to get into this conversation, in the same way that we have got to get into the conversation around our social security system. 

""I have had young people come to my surgeries who can't find work, they don't want to be just doing nothing where they live all day long, they want to be working. 

""But equally we all know there are people who rinse the system as well. 

			 
""There has got to be a way for us to get into that debate in a way that doesn't sound like we are being defensive, that we go on the offensive, that we are for the people who want to work hard and we are also for maintaining the integrity of our welfare state."" 

Mr Umunna, who refused to serve in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet because of major policy differences, insisted he has ""no interest in being a thorn in the side of the leadership"". 

Asked whether he believes Mr Corbyn is the ""best possible person"" in Labour to be the next prime minister, Mr Umunna replied: ""I want the Labour Party to win the next general election. I want whoever is our leader to be prime minister."" 

He criticised Ed Miliband's leadership, complaining that ""our message changed every single bloody month"". 

He mocked the focus on the ""cost of living crisis"", adding: ""Who wants to be told they've got a crisis? They want to know what the solution is."" 

			 
He continued: ""We changed our message constantly. No wonder nobody knew what we really stood for."" 

Mr Umunna pulled out of the race to succeed Mr Miliband just days after announcing his intention to stand, blaming intrusion into his family life. Explaining his short-lived campaign, he said: ""I had a situation where my political life, my work, directly contradicted with the rest of my life and my loved ones and my family.

Steve Palackdharry and his wife, Libby Palackdharry, said they’ve enjoyed living in Royal Oak on a deep, narrow lot beside other lots like it. 



But they and their neighbors on Vinsetta Boulevard were shocked two years ago when a developer bought the two houses next to theirs, then announced he’d demolish them to put up not two, not four, but eight houses on the same parcel. 

As city documents show, those who sold the two homes to would-be developer Kevin Baird, a real estate agent, said that Baird and his fiancée “Tara” posed as ordinary home seekers, promising each of the two sellers that the couple would remodel their aging ranch houses and move in.

“Do we stand by and let them get away with it?"" Steve   Palackdharry said this week, as he and his neighbors — enmeshed in a two-year battle to block the multiple lot splits — readied their next step: a neighborhood garage sale. 

The city blocked Baird's plan for eight lots last year but granted his later request to split one lot in half, prompting residents to hire an attorney. 

“We have to raise money to pay our lawyer. It’s the only way. The city has done all they can, but now it’s up to us,” Palackdharry said. This weekend’s garage sale that ended Saturday raised $1,200, adding to the take at the group’s wine-and-cheese fund-raiser last month, when homeowners pitched in more than $2,400, he said. 

It’s a do-it-yourself effort, with more than 100 neighborhood donors so far. Deed restrictions neighbors are holding up say, in effect, that lots can't be split because no lot may contain more than one house. The city, although supportive, “does not have any jurisdiction” in a dispute about deed restrictions,  Royal Oak City Attorney Mark Liss said. 



Instead, the neighbors — organized as the Vinsetta Heights Property Owners Association, which Steve Palackdharry heads — can fight back only with the fine print of arcane language of their subdivision’s deed restrictions. Michigan property deeds typically contain deed restrictions — legal language that’s often overlooked by property owners and ignored by big-time investors who have lawyers vetting their deals, say experts in real estate law. 

“What surprises me is that the defendant (Baird) bought these houses when he had to know about these deed restrictions,” said Lyle Russell, a Waterford attorney who is handling the lawsuit filed against Baird by the Vinsetta group. 

Baird did not return a phone call from the Free Press. His lawyer, Birmingham-based attorney Will Hosler, said his client could not comment directly on the dispute. Hosler did pose a general question: “How do you juxtapose responsible development when it butts up against deed restrictions that were meant to preserve a certain type of neighborhood that now is outdated?” 

Whether Baird’s approach constitutes “responsible development” is debatable. In a 2012 letter on file at Royal Oak City Hall, Baird wrote to one former homeowner on Vinsetta who ultimately sold her house to him: “We are a young couple who have been saving for years and we fell in love with your home and the property. We have a beautiful golden retriever with epilepsy named Cassidy who is 2 years old. He was our main motivation in starting the search for a home with a large yard.” 

Five months later, the seller wrote to Royal Oak City Planner Joe Murphy that she was “devastated” to learn “that Mr. Baird was planning to demolish the house and clear the trees to create four separate lots."" Each lot is unusually deep for Royal Oak — more than 200 feet — with frontage on both Vinsetta and  West Webster, a seeming invitation to build. 

A decade ago, such tactics were commonplace in the real estate bubble of the early 2000s, which brought on hyper-flipping of properties in speculative hot spots like Birmingham. Now, Royal Oak has seen a resurgence of property values, a flurry of residential construction and, apparently, the return of such tactics. 

“We’re seeing the most single-family construction I’ve probably ever seen here” since coming to work in Royal Oak in 1991, said City Planner Tim Thwing. Although Royal Oak officials from the mayor on down have been strongly supportive of the Vinsetta homeowners’ battle with Baird, the city is virtually powerless to enforce deed restrictions, Thwing said. 

“These old subdivisions have a lot of restrictions in their master deeds. Some of these things tell you how big your dog can be,” Thwing quipped. Other restrictions, still widely found on Michigan property deeds, state that owners can’t sell to “anyone of Hebrew persuasion” — meaning Jews — or to “anyone to any degree of non-Caucasian background,” referring to black people. 

“Those kind of restrictions are obviously unenforceable,” Thwing said. 

So far, what Royal Oak officials have done is deny Baird’s initial request to turn the two lots into eight. Baird sued over the denial and lost last year in Oakland Circuit Court, where a judge upheld the city's interpretation of zoning rules. 

Yet, this year the city gave Baird permission to split one of two  lots in half. That triggered a lawsuit, also filed in Oakland Circuit Court, by the homeowners group against Baird and a development partner.

When it comes to such disputes, beauty is in the eye of Michigan’s landholders, but only if they're willing to foot the legal bills to defend deed restrictions on their properties, said John Staran, attorney for the City of Berkley and Franklin Village. Both communities have seen recent neighborhood battles involving deed restrictions. 

Five years ago in  Franklin, “somebody wanted to put in an office development on Telegraph Road, south of 13 Mile,” Staran said. 

The wooded property was deed-restricted to remain residential lots, but that might have been overlooked except that “the neighbors rallied to enforce their deed restrictions, and they prevailed” in court, Staran said. 

“This is something that people don’t think about too much, but it can be a superior tool in the arsenal of defense for property owners. The difficulty usually is that residents don’t know about them, or aren’t successful at passing the hat” to pay legal costs, he said, adding: “You’ll see garage sales, bake sales, and the popular thing these days is crowdfunding.” 

In Berkley, residents who live just west of the popular Vinsetta Garage restaurant on Woodward Avenue fought restaurateur Curt Catallo's efforts last year to turn residential lots into a parking lot. Residents packed successive city meetings, speaking against the plan, and the city planning commission voted against Catallo's request to change the zoning. 

But if City Hall had sided with him, residents were ready to take him on in court because their deeds contained a vital restriction — nothing but single-family homes was allowed on the lots, said John Lizza of Grosse Pointe Shores, a lawyer considered the dean of deed restriction lawsuits, who briefly advised the residents of their right to sue. 

""They were ready to pass the hat — I told them, they absolutely would win in court,"" said Lizza. He should know, having battled twice on behalf of homeowners in Grosse Pointe Farms who lived near the Grosse Pointe War Memorial, all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court. In two landmark cases argued by Lizza, the residents' single-family residential deed restrictions trumped the War Memorial's plan to build a community education center, more parking and condominiums on adjoining lots. 

According to the legal response by Baird’s attorney to the Royal Oak homeowners’ lawsuit, “they’re trying to say that the deed restrictions have not been applied consistently, and so they can ignore them,” said Craig Daly, a lawyer who is a board member of the homeowners group. 

But the group can show that the restrictions have been enforced going back to at least 1947, Daly told a gathering of more than 50 neighbors last month, at the group’s wine-and-cheese fund-raiser. 

Clutching a microphone while people made out donation checks, Daly said: 

“What’s really important is that we stick together.”

Craig Morrison – „Go your own way“!,Brija Dot Com,"There are cerain artists who manage to stay „cool“ no matter how long they are around. Mostly because they stand out of the avarege and also because of their special touch. One of those artists are certainly Silicone Soul, a legendary duo from Glasgow and it must be their music and attitude that makes them so special. The highlight of their career was with no doubt their single Right On, Right On’ in 2001, but that was only a hit song, which attracted the attention from the fans and industry. We spoke with Craig Morrison about their current and future projects, changes, they have been facing in their career and their latest EP on Darkroom Dubs. 
  If someone asked you, who or what is Silicone Soul, what would you answer and where would you direct that person to look online?   
We are just two friends that met in high school that shared a dream. We play and produce modern electronic music and you if would like you can find out more about us on our website & social media platforms.

  You guys are working together since 1998. Music, scene and audience have changed a lot since. How did you guys change, how did your music change and how do you see the electronic music changed ever since?   
The music changed as the technology changed, to some extent but I think all aspects of electronic music revolve, evolve and rotate. When we started, analogue hardware was the main tools to produce then ‘soft synths’ and computer based DAWs became more readily available, essentially moving production out of a more studio based environment, enabling ‘bedroom’ production and a whole new ethos and approach to music making. Now analogue and modular hardware is popular again, as I guess it’s more tactile and perhaps creates a more authentic sound and randomness to the creative process. We’ve moved with the times, you always have to move forward but as certain genres come in and out of fashion it would be impossible not to be influenced by that. I think we’ve managed to keep our own sound and identity though. It’s not a good idea following fashions. You need to have your own sound and vision and that sentiment has been with us from the beginning. ‘Go your own way, do your own thing, no matter how far out’ was our early mantra. It’s a completely different world to when we started, music and being a DJ wasn’t a career option or a platform for fame and fortune. It was a darkroom, a strobe and a good time. Who the DJ was, wasn’t important, it was all about the quality of the music and the search for the hottest new record. Everything has to progress, from promotional faxes to sponsored Facebook posts but my concern is that image is far out weighing the quality of the music. As DJs spend more time promoting themselves than coming up with fresh sounds. But only love at the end of the day! 
 
  
  You have just released your latest EP on Darkroom Dubs, called “Help will come”. You have collected great feedbacks so far. What does the title refer to? This is your first EP after 2 years? What can we expect from you in the future?   
Actually, Graeme has two house cats and one escaped and was missing for a day, he just sat there knowing that help will come. It makes a great title which we all can related to and follows on from the imagery from our ‘Save Our Souls’ album. 
 
With so much work on our Darkroom Dubs label and the other aspects of music life we’ve been a little less prolific in the last few years in the studio. We are now working on a lot of new music now, especially with our long time collaborator, guitarist Chippy. We are writing a new track for the Soma 25 years compilation, which is next year and working on a new album too for the 25 years. Also, we are finishing off collaborations with Nick Warren and Pedro Aguilar and working on a new EP for Darkroom Dubs.

  Which happening or moment do you consider a breaking point in your career so far? What impact did it have to your professional life?   
Releasing our first record on our own label, Depth Perception with school friends Chris and Peter in ’96. Signing to Soma in ’98. Then the release of our ‘Right On, Right On’ track in 2001, which gave us international exposure and allowed us to start traveling the world playing music for a living. A dream come true really.

  Your schedule is as busy as always. By your opinion, what do you think attracts people to your gigs?   
The thrill of the unexpected and hopefully the knowledge that they are gonna get some cracking fresh tunes they haven’t heard before! 
 
  
  Do you guys often appear separatley and why?   
Sadly it’s down to economics. The flights are often too expensive for the promoter to have us both play. I know other duos like MANDY and Tiefschwarz have the same dilemma. A sign of the times really. It’s hard being a duo sometimes. 
 
  
  I know it is hard to tell, but when you play separately, does your music sound similar or not to when you appear as a duo?   
Haha, yeah that is a tricky one. I think Graeme’s music is a little deeper and musical maybe and I play more darker and a little more “crazy”. But essentially we share the same tastes and a lot of the same music. 
 
  
  In the beginning of October, you will play in Ljubljana (Craig). What would you like to say to your fans here.   
I can’t wait to come back to Ljubljana. I’ve always had a wonderful time and been touched by the hospitality. Looking forward to entertaining you all once again! 
 
  
 
Silicone Soul w. Craig Morrison will appear in Ljubljana on Friday, October 2 nd 2015.

It’s a completely different world to when we started, music and being a DJ wasn’t a career option or a platform for fame and fortune. It was a darkroom, a strobe and a good time. Who the DJ was, wasn’t important, it was all about the quality of the music and the search for the hottest new record. Everything has to progress, from promotional faxes to sponsored Facebook posts but my concern is that image is far out weighing the quality of the music. As DJs spend more time promoting themselves than coming up with fresh sounds. But only love at the end of the day! You have just released your latest EP on Darkroom Dubs, called “Help will come”. You have collected great feedbacks so far. What does the title refer to? This is your first EP after 2 years? What can we expect from you in the future? Actually, Graeme has two house cats and one escaped and was missing for a day, he just sat there knowing that help will come. It makes a great title which we all can related to and follows on from the imagery from our ‘Save Our Souls’ album. With so much work on our Darkroom Dubs label and the other aspects of music life we’ve been a little less prolific in the last few years in the studio. We are now working on a lot of new music now, especially with our long time collaborator, guitarist Chippy. We are writing a new track for the Soma 25 years compilation, which is next year and working on a new album too for the 25 years. Also, we are finishing off collaborations with Nick Warren and Pedro Aguilar and working on a new EP for Darkroom Dubs. (link: https://soundcloud.com/siliconesoul/sets/silicone-soul-help-will-come-darkroom-dubs-preview ) Which happening or moment do you consider a breaking point in your career so far? What impact did it have to your professional life? Releasing our first record on our own label, Depth Perception with school friends Chris and Peter in ’96. Signing to Soma in ’98. Then the release of our ‘Right On, Right On’ track in 2001, which gave us international exposure and allowed us to start traveling the world playing music for a living. A dream come true really. (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe4gjKQUQ7U ) Your schedule is as busy as always. By your opinion, what do you think attracts people to your gigs? The thrill of the unexpected and hopefully the knowledge that they are gonna get some cracking fresh tunes they haven’t heard before! Do you guys often appear separatley and why? Sadly it’s down to economics. The flights are often too expensive for the promoter to have us both play. I know other duos like MANDY and Tiefschwarz have the same dilemma. A sign of the times really. It’s hard being a duo sometimes. I know it is hard to tell, but when you play separately, does your music sound similar or not to when you appear as a duo? Haha, yeah that is a tricky one. I think Graeme’s music is a little deeper and musical maybe and I play more darker and a little more “crazy”. But essentially we share the same tastes and a lot of the same music. In the beginning of October, you will play in Ljubljana (Craig). What would you like to say to your fans here. I can’t wait to come back to Ljubljana. I’ve always had a wonderful time and been touched by the hospitality. Looking forward to entertaining you all once again! Silicone Soul w. Craig Morrison will appear in Ljubljana on Friday, October 2 nd 2015.

Pretty Great, Actually",The Chronical-Express.com,"We already know that ""Everything Has Changed"" on Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy , and for Meredith ( Ellen Pompeo ), that means readjusting to life with roommates - you know, the kind who finish the last of the coffee creamer and bang holes in your wall without permission (though, to be fair, a tequila-swilling Meredith did apparently offer encouragement to ""take the bitch down""). We're talking, of course about Meredith's sister-in-law Amelia ( Caterina Scorsone ), who is also having issues adjusting to life in the Grey household - and their third roommate, Maggie ( Kelly McCreary ), who gets thrust into the role of mediator right off the bat. This is going to be a fun dynamic.

Apparently not Webber ( James Pickens Jr. ), who looks like a cartoon character whose tongue flops out and turns into a staircase when he's around her. Barf. Team Bailey. Later in the episode, Dr. McConnell obviously just happens to be in the observation deck with Webber and Bailey right at the moment that Meredith and Owen's ( Kevin McKidd ) patient crashes, and ends up narrating them through a life-saving scramble as Webber drools more. Luckily, just when she's about to abandon all hope, Bailey gets a pep talk from Ben ( new series regular  Jason Winston George ), and makes her own case for the job while performing a surgery. The summary? Dr. McConnell is new and shiny, but may see Grey Sloan as a stepping stone. For Bailey, the hospital is her home and her challenge. ""This job belongs to me,"" she says. Yep, Team Bailey.

Speaking of, Callie and Arizona ( Jessica Capshaw ) have sold their house, and now Arizona's looking for a roommate - and, she's getting so desperate that she even invites Stephanie ( Jerrika Hinton ) to take the spare room.

[caption id=""attachment_4186"" align=""alignright"" width=""300""] Shelley Lamprell-Josephs[/caption]

I arrived somewhat nervous for my first day, in my first role as an auxiliary nurse, aged just 17. I was directed to a patient’s room having been told she had just died. I was asked to sit with her so that she was not alone. Initially, this was a scary prospect, however, as I sat there holding her hand, I knew it was the right thing to do.

Over 25 years later, my journey as a health and social care professional has included many years of working with palliative clients. This has always included a particular interest in emotional and spiritual needs, which I gradually recognised as an integral part of end of life care. However, several years ago, when I was asked to care for a family friend, my career began to change and further embrace a much more holistic approach. ‘Marian’ was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was extremely frightened, but more than anything, wanted to die in the home she loved.

I supported ‘Marian’ in the few months before she died, accompanying her in her outpatient chemo sessions, inpatient stays and at her home. We talked, laughed and cried and I supported her with anything, from hoovering the front room and sorting out her paperwork, to sitting quietly, holding her hand and offering Reiki sessions. I was there with her throughout the last 24 hours of her life, offering love, reassurance and support to her and her family. I helped to wash and dress her ready for the funeral directors and I supported her family through the funeral process and beyond.

The experience I shared with ‘Marian’ highlighted for me the need for a greater focus and understanding of good quality, individualised, holistic care at the end of life. I have since worked in this way with several other people and I was then asked to create courses for carers and professionals (such as counsellors, nurses, social workers and chaplains) to have all the tools they need to offer quality, holistic end of life care. These courses offer an in-depth exploratory learning environment, which looks at physical, emotional, social, environmental and spiritual aspects of care and support in palliative care.

Through my career, I have discovered that spirituality embraces all our personal beliefs and values that have formed throughout a lifetime, not just religious beliefs, but also individual non-partisan perspectives. These form the way we view the world we live in, as well as our wishes and choices. I was keen to develop further research into this area of palliative care and was therefore delighted to have this opportunity with my undergraduate dissertation. There were some interesting results discovered in the research study, including the issue of linguistic paucity, i.e., are our words/language limited in verbalising our experience of metaphysical phenomena? Also of interest were the repetitive patterns of thinking that highlighted a new processing theory – Primary Existential Design.

Added : Monday, September 21st 2015 
  
The world-wide beer revolution has taken Italy by storm. There are now 900 breweries in the country, the number will soon hit 1,000 and there’s no sign of it stopping there. 
 
Many of the breweries are tiny and some are based in bars. But the likes of Baladin in Piedmont and Lambrate in Milan are growing fast and becoming major players on the beer scene. Brewing is not confined to big cities but takes place in the mountainous Dolomites and as far south as Naples and Sicily: there are between 10 and 15 breweries in Sicily. 
 
Italian artisan beer was in vibrant form at Fermentazioni, a three-day festival in Rome attended by 15,000 exuberant and mainly young drinkers. It’s the third such annual festival and 34 breweries from all over the country (including Sardinia, above) supplied beers that ranged in style from pale and golden ales to midnight black export stouts. 
 
The festival is supported by Slow Food, an influential movement in Italy that believes good food and drink should be made with the finest raw materials and allowed to develop naturally without the aid of artificial chemicals and stabilisers. Slow Food produces an annual Guida alle Birre d’Italia , edited by Luca Giaccone and Eugenio Signoroni, which lists all the breweries and beers in the country. 
 
Andrea Turco, who organises Fermentazioni, is an  IT programmer in Rome who caught the beer bug 15 years ago when he tasted German imports and realised there was more to beer than Moretti and Peroni. 
 
“The concept of ‘good beer’ was strange at first,” he says. “Italians love taste in their food and wine. But we have no brewing history, no roots. Back in 1996 there were just three craft breweries, Italiana, Baladin and Lambrate. Within 10 years, there were 100 breweries.” 
 
Andrea created a group of kindred spirits -- home brewers and beer lovers – to promote good beer and in 2006 he started a blog about new Italian breweries, events, bars with good beer and trends in the industry. He teamed up with the renowned Lorenzo Dabove, the great champion of Italian craft beer, to organise beer tastings. 

From those early stirrings came Italian Craft Beer Week in March, now in its sixth year, during which some 600 bars in Italy stage special events. And then came Fermentazioni. 
 
“Rome is the centre of the craft beer movement,” Andrea says. “Pubs, shops, wine cellars, even bread shops now sell good beer.  Beer and food matching is important when you consider the Italian love of food.” 
 
Most of the Italian breweries are very small but Baladin now produces 10,000 hectolitres a year. The brewery, which is experimenting with ageing beer in oak, uses both barley and hops grown in the north of the country. Free Lions in Tuscany is another brewery that uses only home-grown ingredients. With their close relationship with Slow Food, craft brewers attempt to source raw materials from Italy wherever possible – but one brewer told me loves English Maris Otter malt and imports it for his beers. 
 
With the lack of an Italian beer culture, brewers look abroad for inspiration. The main influences, Andrea says, are Belgium, Britain, Germany and the United States. A two-hour talk and tasting I conducted at Fermentazioni with Eugenio Signoroni was on the subject of India Pale Ale (IPA) with beers from Britain, the U.S. and Italy. 
 
The growth of artisan brewing in Italy is all the more remarkable when you consider brewers have none of the tax advantages enjoyed by small brewers in other European countries. There is no equivalent of Britain’s Progressive Beer Duty that gives tax relief to smaller producers. On the contrary: the Italian government has increased beer duty by 30 per cent over the past two years and there’s no difference in duty levels between Peroni (owned by SABMiller), Moretti (part of Heineken) and craft brewers. 

Fermentazioni takes place in a former textile factory close to the Olympic Stadium in the Lazio region of Rome. On the first evening of the festival I met Sergio Daniele, the lay representative of the Tre Fontane monastery in the city that earlier this year started to brew beer after a break of many centuries. The monastery is more than 1,000 years old and its name – Three Fountains – stems from a fable that says when St Paul died three fountains spontaneously burst from the ground. 
 
The monastery, one of the oldest places in the Christian world, was originally controlled by members of the Benedictine order but the abbey was suppressed during the Napoleonic period. It was reopened by Trappists who restored brewing this year. The monks say they found a recipe dating from the 19 th century though in true Trappist style they won’t reveal the details. 
 
But they do say they add eucalyptus to the beer as the plant grows in the grounds of the monastery. The beer is a golden 8.5 per cent Tripel – clearly inspired by Westmalle in Belgium – and Sergio says the eucalyptus, which is good for fighting malaria, is added at the end of the kettle boil with hops. It adds a delicious spicy and herbal note to a beer rich in malt and hop depths. 
 
The monks brew just 1,000 hectolitres a year and most of the beer is consumed by their community, pilgrims and visitors. It’s the smallest Trappist brewery in the world and has been accepted into membership of the International Trappist Association. 
 
In spite of high levels of duty, beer prices in bars in Rome are remarkably good value when compared to London. At Open Baladin, Via Degli Specchi, there are 40 taps serving beers that, regardless of strength, cost 5 euro a glass. It’s one of a growing number of bars run by Baladin in major cities. The eclectic range includes sour, saison, golden, porter, stout and barley wine. Don’t miss the rich, heady Xygayu, a 13.5 per cent beer aged in rum casks that I first sampled at the Great British Beer Festival in 2014 during a talk by Lorenzo Dabove. 
 
In sharp contrast, No Au, 17 Piazza Montevecchio, near Piazza Navona, is a small bar that specialises in craft beer, organic wines and tasty food. The handful of taps includes three British beer engines. Cantillon lambic is usually available, along with Baladin and Borgo della Birra. 

Via Benedetta, on the opposite bank of the Tiber to Open Baladin, is a short, narrow street but it offers two sharply contrasting bars. Bir & Fud at No 25, run by local restaurateur Manuele Colonna, is spacious and revered for the range and quality of the pizzas served in the restaurant. 
 
Opposite at No 23, Ma Che Siete Venuti a Fa’, is a large hole in the wall with a few seats and a bar staggering under the weight of 13 taps. The name means in Roman dialect “What the **** are you doing here?” The answer is goggling almost in disbelief at a beer range that includes Oud Beersel Lambeek, Brewfist Son of a Gun, Kees IPA, Grapefruit IPA and oak-aged imperial stout, Loverbeer Beerbera, Lambrate Imperial Ghisa, Weihenstephaner Vitus and Knobslauch unfiltered lager. 
 
A narrow passage leads to a back room with more seating and cabinets with displays of bottled beers from around the world. 
 
Bir & Fud has seats on the pavement and a large bar (below) offering up to 30 beers. The restaurant at the rear proves its beer credentials with a chalked depiction of the brewing process on one wall. 
 
The pizzas are superb and are matched with a beer list that includes Real Ale Extra from Birra del Borgo with a herbal and spicy aroma and palate. Other beers include Haberstumpf Zwickel Pils, Troll Patela, Amiata Bastarda Rossa, Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale, Brewfist Spaceman, Dell’Aspida Stout and Strong Belgian Ale, De Struise Pannepot and three beers from England: Moor Raw and Simplicity from Bristol and Wild Beer Rubus Maximus from Somerset.

Current bin collection services for Penrith were to be reassessed in June 2017, but will now remain the same until June 2019. 
 
Penrith City Council voted to extend five current 10 year contracts for garbage and organics, recyclables, effluent waste, civic waste and street litterbins for a further two years. 
 
Councillor John Thain supported the idea, and said he believes the community is happy with current services, including options for extra collections if required. 
 
“I think the community actually quite likes the services we provide. There are a number of options you can choose, including an extra red bin, or an extra yellow bin… and an extra bin collection is hardly going to break anyone’s bank accounts,” he said. 
 
Councillor Marcus Cornish is unhappy with the extension, demanding weekly collections be reinstated. 
 
“It’s insulting to the people of Penrith. The bin collection effects people who are less well off, who can’t afford the extra costs,” he said. 
 
Glenmore Park resident Judy Adams has paid for an extra recycling bin for the last three years, and said it’s absolutely necessary for a large household. 
 
“There’s six of us in the house, and it just wouldn’t all fit. It does cost more, but if you have a lot of people in the household you need to have the extra bins otherwise the rubbish flows out and it’s disgusting,” she said. 
 
“However, I do think Council should reassess whether or not they give larger households extra red bins. And I don’t think they should have to pay for them.”

She eventually expressed her feelings to this reporter before leaving to Independence Square to continue her protest where the Venezuelan president was expected to speak.

More than half a million Mozambican women between the ages of 20 and 24 years old got married before the age of 18. 
 
Albino Francisco, a National Coalition to End Child Marriage in Mozambique representative told delegates at a psychosocial forum on Thursday, “… 56 323 of [them] were married before they reached 15 years of age.” 
 
He was speaking at the three-day long forum held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, hosted by the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative (Repssi). The network hosts the forum bi-annually to promote awareness among governments, civil society, academia and media about the need for psychosocial support for children. 
 
Francisco said these statistics are from an analysis of the latest health surveys (in 2011), census projections and governmental administrative data. The statistics translate to 48.2% of the women in this age group getting married before they turned 18 and 14.3% of them getting married before they turned 15. “In Mozambique, child marriage is illegal before the age of 18, although the law allows for exceptions up to 16 years of age where there is consent from the child’s parents,” he said. 
 
Teen pregnancy was a natural association of child marriage and the statistics for this were equally shocking. “In total, more than 439.453 women aged 20-24 had their first child before their 18th birthday, 85.257 of which concerned mothers who were aged less than 15 at the birth of their first child,” he said. 
 
He said “religious and regional” factors contributed to the ongoing practice and there was a much higher rate of child marriage in central and northern regions than in southern regions. Interestingly, he said, “girls living in female-headed households have a significantly lower probability of getting married before 18 than girls living in male-headed households”.  “Similarly, the probability of entering into child marriage decreases unambiguously with the age of the head of household.” 
 
Some of the effects of child marriage were a “significantly lower likelihood of finishing primary school and starting secondary school” and “the children of adolescent mothers are significantly more malnourished than children of mothers in other age groups at the national level”. 
 
Neighbouring country, Tanzania, has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. 
 
Co-ordinator for the Agape Aids control programme, Deozawadi Marandu, told delegates that on average, “almost two out of five girls will be married before their 18th birthday”. The programme was established in 2006 and operates in the country’s Shinyanga region and its founders entered an agreement with the Firelight Foundation this year to implement a Stop Child Marriages and Early Pregnancies Project. 
 
He said the causes of child marriages in the region include “the prevalence of harmful norms that make the community to view girls as source of income”. 
 
In some communities “child marriage is preferred as it is believed that when a girl conceives while at home, she will remove the honor of the family and reduces bride wealth,” he said. The programme aimed to educate and sensitise communities about child rights and the harmful effects of child marriages through “public video sessions; community and victims change agent groups, and school clubs”. 
 
They attempted family reconciliation and re-unification and gave victims legal representation. They also advocated for changing the Tanzanian Marriage Act of 1971 “which says children are allowed to be married at 14”, he said. 
 
As a result of their efforts, more than 750 vulnerable girls have been rescued from child marriages and reintegrated into formal education, he said. Others have been supported in accessing vocational studies to pursue jobs such as tailoring, welding and electrical installation. Sixty girls have received business training and been given start up grants to initiate small businesses.” 
 
“To effectively address the problem of child marriages, there is a need to have a holistic approach that looks at policy changes, addresses community attitudes, strengthens households economically and also empowers girls,” he said.

 So often in this column I feel that I'm writing about basic concepts and using trivial examples. It's often up to you, as the reader, to figure out how to apply these concepts to your development. I thought it might be a good idea to take some space to try to bring a lot of the concepts together and build an application. I don't always take the space to do so, but thought I'd give it a try here.  

I'm sure that most of you read (or at least have heard of) blogs. Blogs are a great way to keep up on the up-to-the-minute comings and going of whatever community you choose. There are tons of bloggers throughout the ColdFusion community, some blogging from inside Adobe. Many blogs provide an RSS feed for content. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and is an XML dialect. There are a handful of RSS aggregators in the ColdFusion community such as mxna ( http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mxna/ ), Full As a Goog ( www.fullasagoog.com/ ), and Feed Squirrel ( www.feed-squirrel.com/ ). I've always thought it would be cool to create something like a LiveJournal friends list of my very own. In this series of articles, I'm going to step you through the thought process that I'd go through to create one. First I'll concentrate on designing the database and fleshing out the ColdFusion components. 

 Designing the Back End 
When developing an application, I normally start with the database design, and that is where we'll start here. If you need a refresher on database design techniques, you can review the database design article from this column at http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/49177.htm . What data do you want to store in an RSS Aggregator application? You can read all about the RSS 2.0 spec at www.rssboard.org/rss-specification . For purposes of this article, I'm only going to concentrate on required fields. 
 RSS Feeds: The RSS feed seems like a good place to start. The app will have to store the name of the RSS feed and the URL location of the feed.  Items: Since we're aggregating feed data from a lot of different sources, we'll need to store the posts from each individual feed. It'll be more efficient to store them locally than to create the feed manually each time we want to display something. A post is put into the RSS XML document as an item. According to the spec, nothing is required in the item except for title or description; there's no guarantee that one will be there. For the sake of this article, we'll assume that title, link, and description will be there. Items have a one-to-many relationship with RSS feeds. Each blog can contain many posts, but each post belongs to only one blog. To implement this in the database, we put a primary key for the RSS feed into the items table.  Categories: Within the app, I want to be able to categorize each feed, so I can filter the group of messages that I'm reading. We'll add a category table to the database. This data won't be coming from the RSS, but some identifier that we create. The database structure is shown in Figure 1 . 
For the model portion of this app, I'm going to use ColdFusion components. You can read more about component basics in two of my articles at http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/47203.htm and http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/47446.htm . I'd create one CFC for each element: an RSS Feed, an Item, and a Category. You can see the model in Figure 2 . You may notice that the CFCs are named in the singular tense, while the database tables are plural. This is because each CFC is designed to represent a single item, while the database tables contain many items. I left out individual getter and setter methods from the diagram, but the code will use the generic getter and setter methods from Hal Helm's BaseComponent.cfc http://halhelms.com/webresources/BaseComponent.cfc . Each component includes an init and a commit method. The init will load information out of the database, while the commit will create (or update) information in the database. 
 
The RSSFeed and RSSCategory components will be used for maintaining feeds and categories. You might notice that the RSSFeed component contains an RSSCategory component instead of the CategoryID foreign key. I thought about putting an array of item objects in the RSSFeed, but decided against it. The application won't need to load all the items from the feed in question; a gateway object can be used to handle this type of action when viewing the data (although that's beyond the scope of this article). The RSSaggregator component is where most of the magic takes place. It will be the background process, run as part of a scheduled task. It will loop through each feed in the database, collect the latest data, and store the new items in the database. It will use the item component. 

 Creating the RSS Feed Components 
In real-world applications, I often like to start by building the administrator first. That way I don't have to worry about filling the tables with fake data to test the public-facing part of the site. Before we can start to process feeds on the back-end, we have to be able to enter the feeds into the database. We can start by fleshing out the RSSFeed and RSSCategory components. First, let's examine the RSSCategory component, as shown in Listing 1 . Nothing in the RSSCategory.cfc should surprise you. It contains two instance variables, the CategoryID and Category. The CategoryID is initialized as a string because this app uses UUIDs as primary keys instead of auto-incrementing integers. The component has two methods (plus a few inherited from Hal's BaseComponent.cfc). There's an init method that accepts the CategoryID and the datasource. It queries the database and sets the instance variables, if applicable. The second method is a commit method. It accepts the datasource name as an argument. If the CategoryID is blank, a new category is created. If it isn't, an update is performed. This isn't much different, in concept, from the address.cfc I wrote about in one of my previous component articles. 

The RSSFeed component is shown in Listing 2 . You'll notice many similarities to the RSSCategory component. There are more properties in RSSFeed than RSSCategory, but the concept is the same. You can notice that the category property of the component is an instance of the RSSCategory component. Instead of containing the category information directly, only the reference is stored. To access the category information, we can use the get, or set, methods off the component instance. The set methods are demonstrated in init; while the get methods are demonstrated in commit. 

 Entering the Data 
To enter the data, a simple HTML form is used, as shown in Listing 3 . The first lines include a syslib.cfm file. This is just a utility library of functions. Two functions from the library are used in this component. The GetCategories function contains a query to get all categories. The ""CreateSelectList"" function is very similar to the cfselect tag for those who don't use cfform. (I'll make sure that all the code behind this article gets up on my blog; I left out the syslib.cfm for brevity). 

The file creates an instance of the RSSFeed component. If an RSSFeedID is defined, it will run the init method; otherwise the base component is used. A form is created that asks for the category, and the http link of the RSS feed. The title and description are displayed on this form, but are actually populated from the RSS feed, so they're not editable. 

The form submits onto Feedip.cfm, which is shown in Listing 4 . The initialization code is the same as in Listing 3. Then the code enters a try block. To get the description and title, we need to call the RSS feed. If the cfhttp call times out, we know that the RSS feed is wrong. The URL could be invalid in other ways, but that's the only thing we check for in this code. XMLParse is called on cfhttp.filecontent. I wrote an article about getting and processing XML feeds this way, and you can read it at http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/117667.htm . The remainder of the code sets the instance variables and calls the commit. Congratulations, you've saved a feed in the database. 

 What's Next 
I've just about run out of space for this article, but this app is far from complete. In the next article I'll talk about the RSSAggregator and item componentS. It will create the scheduled task to call the aggregation code. Space permitting, I'll go into a gateway component along with some code that can be used to look at the aggregated data. If there isn't space in the next article for that, I'll fit it into some future article. Until next time, keep coding.

Contrary to mainstream media attention, the multiple possibilities of how consumer IoT will transform our everyday lives aren’t the only angle of this headline-gaining trend. There’s a huge opportunity for “industrial IoT” and “Smart Cities” to impact the world in the same capacity – especially during critical situations. For example, a community water dam that needs to release water can leverage embedded critical communications logic to alert the appropriate individuals, on the right device, as soon as they are needed to take action.

You'll notice many similarities to the RSSCategory component. There are more properties in RSSFeed than RSSCategory, but the concept is the same. You can notice that the category property of the component is an instance of the RSSCategory component. Instead of containing the category information directly, only the reference is stored. To access the category information, we can use the get, or set, methods off the component instance. The set methods are demonstrated in init; while the get methods are demonstrated in commit. Entering the Data To enter the data, a simple HTML form is used, as shown in Listing 3 . The first lines include a syslib.cfm file. This is just a utility library of functions. Two functions from the library are used in this component. The GetCategories function contains a query to get all categories. The ""CreateSelectList"" function is very similar to the cfselect tag for those who don't use cfform. (I'll make sure that all the code behind this article gets up on my blog; I left out the syslib.cfm for brevity). The file creates an instance of the RSSFeed component. If an RSSFeedID is defined, it will run the init method; otherwise the base component is used. A form is created that asks for the category, and the http link of the RSS feed. The title and description are displayed on this form, but are actually populated from the RSS feed, so they're not editable. The form submits onto Feedip.cfm, which is shown in Listing 4 . The initialization code is the same as in Listing 3. Then the code enters a try block. To get the description and title, we need to call the RSS feed. If the cfhttp call times out, we know that the RSS feed is wrong. The URL could be invalid in other ways, but that's the only thing we check for in this code. XMLParse is called on cfhttp.filecontent. I wrote an article about getting and processing XML feeds this way, and you can read it at http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/117667.htm . The remainder of the code sets the instance variables and calls the commit. Congratulations, you've saved a feed in the database. What's Next I've just about run out of space for this article, but this app is far from complete. In the next article I'll talk about the RSSAggregator and item componentS. It will create the scheduled task to call the aggregation code. Space permitting, I'll go into a gateway component along with some code that can be used to look at the aggregated data. If there isn't space in the next article for that, I'll fit it into some future article. Until next time, keep coding.

Katy Perry  might be the superstar of the family, but her father has some major jokes. Over the weekend, our favorite California Gurl took to Burning Man 2015 for the very first time, and showed off her not-so-great segway skills. 
 
In the clip, which she posted on Instagram, the pop titan is seen spinning around on the electric scooter, before falling off the device and losing it to the mega-winds of the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. If it makes you feel any better, Katy, it was a pretty graceful stumble. 
 
It was clearly all in good fun as Katy took to the social media platform just one day later to share a video of her father, Keith Hudson , doing his own spin on the segway ... just without the fall. ""Hey Bird, you need a lesson 'cause this is the way you do it,"" her father says, before cracking a laugh. As for Katy's response to the jab, she wrote in the caption for the video, ""thanks dad .""

But the footsteps of director Ken Kwapis' adaptation of Bill Bryson's 1998 memoir tread both sides of the moral divide simultaneously, making his expedition suitable only for discerning adults. 
 
Despite its real-life origins, the film manages to combine a number of standard Hollywood elements more often found in Tinseltown's fictional fare. For starters, we have a pair of mildly cantankerous older men — travel author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford), who takes Andy Rooney-like exception to contemporary prices, and lovable rogue Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), the aging embodiment of an Allman Brothers Band song from about 1972. 
  Robert Redford and Nick Nolte star in a scene from the movie ""A Walk in the Woods."" The Catholic News Service classification is L — limited adult audience, films whose problematic content many adults would find troubling. The Motion Picture Association of America rating is R — restricted. Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. (CNS photo/Broad Green Pictures)  
These estranged friends are thrown back together — and thus enabled to qualify as an odd couple — when Bill, chafing at semiretirement and seeking a remedy for his long-standing writer's block, decides to defy his physical limitations by hiking the 2,200-mile-long Appalachian Trail. The old ""grandpa's not ready for the home just yet"" theme? Check. 
 
Not surprisingly, Bill's eminently sensible British-born wife Catherine (Emma Thompson) objects vigorously to his quixotic plan. Though he remains resolute, Bill does at least yield to Catherine's insistence that he include a companion on the trip. 
 
But the only volunteer Bill can find to accompany him turns out to be Stephen, a figure from his distant past with whom Bill — partly, at least, by choice — has long been out of touch. 
 
As domesticated Bill and his rolling stone of a sidekick lumber through the forest — a veteran of multiple orthopedic surgeries, Stephen is in even worse shape than Bill — they pass the time comparing notes on life. Some of these, most prominently, perhaps, Stephen's struggle with alcoholism, are honorable enough. 
 
Yet a surfeit the pals' dialogue deals with sexuality — including the humorously remembered bedroom escapades of their shared youth. And the frivolous tone of Rick Kerb and Bill Holderman's script invites viewers to regard physical intimacy, at least among singles, as little more than a form of entertainment. 
 
Marital fidelity gets a somewhat more sober treatment. But even events turning on this topic are dealt with ambiguously. 
 
While one sequence celebrates faithfulness in the face of temptation, another winks at a potentially adulterous dalliance. The moral significance of this potential encounter — the screenplay leaves us uncertain just how far things actually progressed — is sloughed off on the dubious grounds that the randy behavior of fat people is too ridiculous to be taken seriously. 
 
All this detracts from what is, in other respects, a generally pleasant, though excessively talky, excursion through a series of landscapes that vary from the soothing to the magnificent. 
 
The film contains defective values, including an ambivalent attitude toward adultery, a nongraphic scene of aberrant sexual activity, a glimpse of partial rear nudity, much off-color humor, numerous uses of profanity and frequent rough and crude language.

For starters, we have a pair of mildly cantankerous older men — travel author Bill Bryson (Robert Redford), who takes Andy Rooney-like exception to contemporary culture, and old codger Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), who welcomes it. Then there's a beauty (Emily Blunt as Mary Katherine ""Katherine"" Waterson). She's showing the ""beauty"" less tolerance than the gruff Bill.

They agreed in separate interviews with KUNA that a major factor that forced about 10 companies to quit the KSE recently was that the capitalization value of their stocks did not match their announced value on the market, besides the cost of listing they pay annually.

Other reasons were the low trading over their stocks and the drop of their capital value, in addition to new laws they could not cope with, such as the governance bill.

For the General-Manager of Al-Arabi Financial Brokerage Company Maitham Al-Shakhth, this is a ""healthy phenomenon"" as it helps ""clean"" the market and only keeps companies with strong solvency in.

Some think that withdrawals are likely to harm the market, even if the firms cannot take decisions, or if they make loss, he told KUNA. They are mistaken.

On the other hand, head of the Traders Society Mohammed Al-Tarrah adopted a view that the withdrawal, though ""voluntary"", has cast dark shadows on traders, noting that the market lost KD 2 billion in August.

Al-Tarrah referred to some ""fault"" in the market that has to be repaired as soon as possible to preserve people's money, especially small traders.

He agreed that the listing at the KSE constitutes a financial and an administrative burden for many firms that could not apply the recent decisions taken by the Capital markets Authority.

He urged the concerned authorities to develop investment alternatives to stop the phenomenon.

Meanwhile, the KSE ended Sunday's session in the red zone, as the Weighted Index fell by 5.09 points, the Price Index lost 91.82 points, reaching 5,666 points, and the KSX 15 went down by 14.36 points.

The number of trades was 3,618 with a value of KD 11 million and a volume of 168 million. The first session of the week was dominated by anticipation, as some market makers refrained from getting involved in trading amid rising speculations and rapid profit-taking operations over some stocks that hit tempting prices last week.",362,"laws they could not cope with, such as the governance bill.

Intriguing Answers Form Acclaimed Authors,Huffington Post,"I've had the great fortune of interviewing many acclaimed authors. They always have much to say about the craft of writing. One of the questions I've asked often has been What has surprised you about the writing life?  

Here is what some of those widely read authors said: 

Sue Grafton: I'm an introvert. I love that about my life, but it's part of my job to get out in the marketplace and promote my books. It surprised me to learn it was expected of me; and it surprised me even more that I've become quite good at it. 

Linwood Barclay: The biggest surprise I think is that becoming an author has afforded me the opportunity to experience humiliation in ways I never knew existed. You think, 'Wow. I'm a published author, now.' Then you go to a bookstore event, and absolutely nobody comes. The only thing worse than nobody coming to an event, is if only one person shows up. If nobody comes, you just go to the nearest bar. But if one person is there, you have to talk, and maybe even sign a book, if one manages to get sold. 

Sara Paretsky: A big surprise for me is that there's such good will among crime writers. In the world of the important literary writers, there are always feuds and quarrels, such as the classic one between Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal. Crime writers aren't viewed as being as important as so-called literary writers; that creates a different and more collegial atmosphere. 

Louis Begley: I'm surprised by how steadying writing is for me. Without writing, I would be impossible to live with. If I did not have this occupation, I would be in great trouble. So, I need the writing to maintain equilibrium in my life. 

Harlan Coben : What really surprises me is that after a long climb up the ladder, I've become a bestselling author, and can still have a normal life, living in the suburbs with my wife and four kids. 

Lisa Gardner: What surprises me is that it doesn't get easier. With thirty books written, you would think I'd feel proficient, but each book is painful in its own way. I'm always just feeling my way to that other side--the completed novel. I feel I'm forever gnashing my teeth and banging my head against a blank computer screen. 

David Morrell: What surprises me most of all is how things have changed in the writing world. When I started, there were no book signings. Novelists didn't go on tour or do publicity. None of the chain bookstores existed. There was a time when ten or fifteen book warehouses existed in each state; they serviced mom-and-pop grocery stores and stationery stores. Those warehouses disappeared. The chain bookstores appeared, and now, most of them are gone. And of course, we now have the e-book revolution. I've seen a great deal that's changed in the writing world. 

Jayne Ann Krentz : What surprises me is that today, authors get stuck with so much of the marketing end of publishing. It wasn't the case when I started out. I think it's because of the chaos in the industry now. Publishers used to do the marketing. But today, with so much happening online, most writers are forced to do a great deal of their own marketing. 

Michael Connelly: What's surprised me is how storytelling is so important around the world. A character trying to solve a murder and find his place in the world in L.A. can connect with someone in Dublin or Paris.  As I've had more success, I've had more opportunities to travel. It always surprises and fulfills me when someone stands up at a book signing in France and says they're very worried about Harry Bosch. 

Dennis Lehane: What surprises me is that it's as cool as I had hoped it would be. Even twenty years down the line, it still seems surreal. I mean, there was a time when I was a complete nobody, and in my fantasy life thought, 'Wouldn't it be cool if somebody actually wanted me to sign one of my books?' I still live in that place--where it all seems like a fantasy. 

Faye Kellerman: The biggest surprise is that it doesn't get easier. With most tasks, the more you perform them, the more rote they become. With writing, you can never, ever, sit back and have it come easily. It's a joy, but it's a struggle. It always gives me a headache. The more you write, the harder it gets because you've used up plots; you've used up characters; you've used up words. 

Ian Rankin : What's surprised me is that as I get older, writing doesn't get easier. When I started, I thought this would be like being a car mechanic. Once you've stripped enough engines and put them back together, you can do it blindfolded. But for a writer, each book is different. It's never the same engine. You want to make this one the book. We keep going because none of us has written the perfect book--the distillation of everything you want to say about the world. 

Clive Cussler: I would have to say, the only real surprise has been the success. That's really been quite unexpected. I get up in the morning, get to the office and write until about six o'clock in the evening. Then I share a bottle of wine with my wife. Everything else is the same.

Linwood Barclay: I would never have estimated that sheer thrill I get from accepting an invitation to talk about my book in a register office, my reading at a library in a small city or from seeing my face on a book poster at my local library. There's an interesting frisson at the thought I might never have experienced had I not chosen to become a writer. Andrew Veresay: Sometimes","The biggest surprise for any writer who hasn’t yet written a book…is just how long it takes from when inspiration first strikes (whenever exactly “inspired” may be) until publication day—a process which might take several years during this brave new world we live In these interviews are insights into becoming successful writers such as Stephen King on being honest with oneself and Robert B Parker offering his suggestions over 40 pages or three sections.

John Fetterman, the mayor of Braddock, Pennsylvania, announced Monday that he was seeking the Democratic nomination to take on Republican Sen. Pat Toomey next year. Standing at 6' 8"", with tattoos and wearing cargo shorts and a black, short-sleeved shirt, Fetterman announced his bid from a rooftop near Pittsburgh, according to WTAE-4 in Pittsburgh . 

""I do not look like a typical politician. Ha, I don't even look like a typical person,"" said Fetterman, who is running against Katie McGinty and former Rep. Joe Sestak for the Democratic nod. 

Voters have taken a shine to outsiders so far -- lifting up candidates like Sanders, Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, while peeling away from veteran politicians like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush. 

On the face of it, Fetterman fits that mold: he is a former Americorps volunteer, albeit a Harvard-educated one, who has spent the last 14 years working in Braddock to try and turn around the western Pennsylvania steel town. 

But he faces one candidate with strong establishment backing -- McGinty has won the support of former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell --  and another with strong Washington ties -- Sestak. 

""I haven't done any polls, I haven't done any focus groups. I mean look at me. I'm not a polished specimen here,"" he told WTAE's Bob Mayo. ""I'm going to either win or lose this race by being my true authentic self and telling the people the truth.

The US PGA Championship winner succeeded Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings after a final round of 69 earned him a six-shot victory at Conway Farms. 
  Australia's Jason Day is on top of the world   
Being his sport's top player is an experience that Day could come to be comfortable with, but hitting the summit for the first time had him struggling to explain his emotions. 

			 
""I'm not really thinking about it right now. It doesn't feel real,"" he told Sky Sports 4. 



 
""Knowing the Shark (Norman) spent 331 weeks up the top of the world ranking list - a very long time - and next week's going to be my first week."" 

Day, having recorded scores of 61, 63 and 69 in his first three rounds, finished on 22 under par after carding three birdies and a bogey on Sunday with nearest challenger, American Daniel Berger, only managing to equal his two-under-par final-round effort. 

The 27-year-old Australian added: ""I feel good. Just all the work ever since I was a little kid trying to get to number one in the world and today I did it, which was great. 

""To have an opportunity, knowing I had to win this week to gain that spot, and stepping up and doing it was fantastic."" 

			 
Day begins his reign at the summit by playing at The Tour Championship, starting on Thursday, and the Queenslander is in the driving seat to scoop the FedEx Cup. 

""I'm going to take Monday and Tuesday off,"" he said. 

""I'm going to go home (to Westerville, Ohio) and then I'll fly down to Atlanta on Tuesday night. Try to get as much rest as possible. The last two days have been very stressful for me. 

""Emotionally it's been very up and down inside. I may not show it but inside I'm going up and down. 

			 
""I've got to try to reset everything. After this week, after my celebration tonight, it's done. I've got to get into next week and try to win the FedEx Cup."" 

Berger could have been closer to Day having registered five birdies on Sunday but, unfortunately for the 22-year-old, they were accompanied by three bogeys in a topsy-turvy round. 

Scott Piercy made birdie at the final hole to clinch third at 15 under and  JB Holmes, Rickie Fowler and McIlroy were tied for fourth one further shot adrift.

781404,819fcbc2-2bfe-48d2-aae0-8bb6971fbe4d,Companies Face Hurdles in Addressing Climate Risks,Stock Nod,"A growing number of major global companies are assessing the risks posed by climate change, but many still struggle to translate climate data into actions to improve resilience, according to a new report by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES). "","" released today at Climate Week NYC, examines how companies are preparing for climate risks and what is keeping them from doing more. C2ES also suggests companies and cities collaborate to strengthen climate resilience. 

Most major companies - 91 percent of the Standard and Poor's Global 100 Index - recognize climate risks to their business. A growing number - at least 39 percent - are conducting vulnerability assessments, and many (30 percent) use climate-specific models, according to the report. 

But there's no one-size-fits-all method to assess climate risks, and companies struggle to connect the dots between global data projecting long-term impacts and location-specific, short-term business decisions. 

""Governments and companies must take action to reduce the emissions contributing to climate change,"" said C2ES President Bob Perciasepe. ""But climate change is already imposing real costs on companies and communities, and they'll need to work together to increase resilience."" 

""Climate impacts - rising sea level, more frequent and intense heat waves, flooding and drought, and other extreme weather events - affect a company's facilities, operations, supply and distribution chains, employees and customers,'' said report co-author Katy Maher. ""Many companies are taking steps to better understand their risks, but they face challenges to building climate resilience."" 

The report synthesizes findings from public disclosures by S&P Global 100 companies, in-depth interviews with more than 50 companies, and workshops with business leaders, government officials, academics and other stakeholders. It expands on a 2013 C2ES report that provided a baseline for how companies were assessing their climate vulnerabilities. Funding for the multi-year C2ES research initiative on business resilience is provided by Bank of America. 

The report was released at a Climate Week NYC event featuring Amy Luers, assistant director of climate resilience and information at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy; Alex Liftman, Bank of America's global environmental executive; Roberta Barbieri, global environmental director for Diageo; Jay Bruns, vice president of public policy at The Hartford; and Melissa Lavinson, corporate sustainability officer for PG&E. 

Key Findings 

Most major companies recognize and report climate risks. Ninety-one of the 100 companies in the S&P Global 100 Index see extreme weather and climate change impacts as current or future risks to their business. Most of the companies (84) discuss climate risk concerns in CDP questionnaires. Fewer companies do so in their sustainability reports (47) or financial filings (40), but reporting has increased slightly since 2013. Companies worry about climate impacts beyond their facilities. Almost all companies interviewed expressed concern about impacts to their supply chains. As one company noted, ""You are only as resilient as your weakest link, so it is important to identify where that link is."" They also worry about public roads and other infrastructure, and access to electricity and water. There isn't one right way to assess and manage climate risks. Many companies view climate change as a ""threat multiplier"" that exacerbates existing risks. This puts climate change into a familiar context, but could cause companies to overlook or underestimate threats. Some companies examine risks across their enterprise, while others focus on specific facilities, regions, or threats - such as climate impacts on water supply, which was a key concern. Companies struggle to translate long-term, global climate data into short-term, local risks. Despite growing access to climate-related data and tools, companies say they need ""actionable science"" that helps them understand locally-specific risks or risk scenarios. They also struggle to incorporate long-term climate risks into short-term business decisions. C2ES Recommendations Companies can start with a limited-scope vulnerability assessment - focusing, for example, on the most critical parts of the business - to raise internal awareness of climate risks. Companies should facilitate regular communication across departments involved in climate risk and resilience -- including sustainability, risk management, operations, and finance - and consider whether to change planning horizons to better incorporate climate risks. Companies, state and city governments, non-profits and local experts should explore partnerships to analyze data, evaluate climate risks, do cost-benefit studies, and implement resilience planning. Not all companies report climate risk and the degree of detail varies significantly among those that do. Governments should look for ways to streamline climate risk reporting and provide more guidance on how to incorporate climate risks into financial disclosures. Governments should improve public infrastructure and provide opportunities for the private sector to contribute to resilience planning efforts and investments.

“ Qué, Qué ?” The repeated cry of “why?” over social media was all that could be said in light of the news: Sábado Gigante, the TV variety show that has been an institution in Latin and North American homes for 53 years, is going off the air. 
 
The announcement stunned the show’s millions of fans. After all, Sábado Gigante ( Gigantic Saturday ) is the longest-running variety show in television history, certified by Guinness World Records. During the show’s 2,600 consecutive weeks on the air, or 16,000 hours of programming, there has never been a single rerun. Fresh episodes have been airing every weekend since the show premiered in Chile in 1962. 
 
“Did I know, that first night, that the show would go this far? Never,” says Gigante creator Mario Luis Kreutzberger Blumenfeld. “It was an idea born under modest circumstances.” 
 
In fact, the juggernaut that has at times reached an estimated 90 million homes was part of Chile’s baby steps into the broadcasting world, thanks to a young man’s love of American television — and lack of interest in tailoring. 
 
Kreutzberger, 74, was born in Talca, Chile, where his Jewish parents fled after escaping Nazi Germany. 
 
His classically trained mother’s singing lessons sparked a desire in him to perform, and he had some early success with acting and character-driven stand-up comedy. His father, probably thinking in more practical terms, sent Kreutzberger to New York in 1959 to follow in his footsteps and become a tailor. 
   
Don Francisco says Sábado Gigante’s legacy will be the good memories it leaves with viewers when the show airs its final episode Sept. 19. (Photo: Rodrigo Varela) 
   
While in New York, Kreutzberger fell in love with American TV — not zoning out in front of it, but getting inspiration. Chilean television was in its infancy when he returned home in the early 1960s, bringing with him some very big ideas about a variety show. He put together a program packed with comedy and news, singing and dancing, parodies and serious interviews. To host the show, Kreutzberger created a funny, flirtatious alter ego with an easier-to-remember name: Don Francisco. 
 
Early versions of the show ran on Sunday, lasted eight hours and were canceled twice. The third time —along with a Saturday-evening time slot and a downsizing to around three hours — was the charm. 
 
Sábado Gigante became a hit in Chile, then in Latin America, Europe and beyond. In more than 40 countries, every Saturday night, generations of families, from abuelos to grandkids, gathered around the tube to watch together. 
 
The show began airing in Miami in 1986 on the Spanish International Network (SIN). The following year the network was relaunched as Spanish-language U.S. network Univision, and the show became a ratings monster as millions of immigrants reconnected with a family tradition. 
 
The show’s reputation for wildly over-the-top comedy skits and cheeky contests made it popular with non-Spanish-speaking viewers, too. You didn’t have to understand the language to be joyfully transfixed by El Chacal de la Trompeta , a singing competition featuring a hooded judge whose name translates to Trumpet Jackal.

When appropriate, the show took a serious tone. Viewers met presidential candidates through Don Francisco’s direct, news-anchor-like interviews, and were invited to celebrate Cinco de Mayo at the White House in 2001. They processed the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks and were riveted by the 2010 rescue of the Chilean miners in reports that were by turns straightforward and emotional. 
 
Sábado Gigante ‘s 40th year of programming in 2002 was cause for celebration, as well as contemplation. 
 
As Sábado continued to beat English-language programming on the big networks, Kreutzberger, who missed only one show, when his mother passed away in 1974, may have been the only one thinking about the end. “I spent a lot of sleepless nights consulting my pillow, as well as my wife (Teresa “Temmy” Muchnik), my kids (Vivi, Francisco and Patricio), and of course my colleagues on the Gigante team,” he says. “For the past 13 years, I’ve been preparing to stop doing what has been the love of my life.” 
 
Univision president of programming and content Alberto Ciurana admits, “There is no replacing Sábado Gigante ,” but says the plan is to fill the time slot with Sabadazo, another variety show, and a Saturday edition of celebrity news show Sal y Pimienta ( Salt and Pepper ), which will also keep its regular Sunday time slot. 
 
The final episode of Sábado Gigante airs live Sept. 19 and will be “full of adrenaline,” Kreutzberger promises. “The last show should be a faithful reflection of what it has always been: humble, vibrant, exciting, full of human warmth.” As Antonio Arias predicts, “It will be a historic moment in television.”

948880,ded8ad9c-eb80-44bd-a083-9f4213b0cc90,Guinea celebrates with song as victory over Ebola nears,ZeeNews.com,"Conakry: Thousands of Guineans have celebrated the country reaching the final stages of the battle with the deadly Ebola epidemic at a concert featuring artists from across Africa. The tropical virus has killed more than 11,000 people in west Africa - 2,500 of them in Guinea - since it emerged in the country's southern forests in December 2013.

But with Liberia declared free of transmission, and Guinea and Sierra Leone registering just three and six cases respectively in September, life is returning to normal in all three countries.

Entitled ""Ebola: All Together towards victory"", the free open-air concert yesterday in the capital Conakry featured around a dozen Guinean artists including Soul Bang's, Sia Tolno and BanlieuZ'art.

Ivorian hip hop group Kiff No Beat also performed, as well as Nigerian rapper WizKid and singer Denise, from Madagascar, with the crowd predicted to peak at around 25,000.

WizKid, 25, said he was singing to ""encourage the healthcare warriors on the ground"", rallying the audience to ""stamp out Ebola with song"".

""We are singing for humanitarianism and it's free. We are participating in our own way to comfort families, people in tears and orphans who have no support,"" Denise told AFP.

The event, broadcast on Guinean television, was staged by Paris-based international media group Vivendi, which owns a number of businesses including French TV channel and movie producer Canal+.

""Vivendi wants to pay tribute to remarkable efforts from the Guinean government and the World Health Organization in their continuous fight against the Ebola outbreak,"" the company said ahead of the concert.

Earlier in September Guinea notched up a week without a single new case of Ebola, its first since March 2014, and the country has been able to announce presidential elections for October 11.

Despite positive signs that an end to the epidemic is within reach, the United Nations has repeatedly warned against complacency, however, including in the international community.

The outbreak ""is not finished by a long shot"", Bruce Aylward, the head of the UN's response to the epidemic, told reporters in Geneva earlier this month.

He added that vigilance in the three hardest-hit countries would be essential through to the end of 2016, as the virus is embedded within the area's animal population.

Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, September 22 
This tour might not be such a big deal if it were at House of Blues — where one of today’s bigger solo male pop stars, Nick Jonas, happens to be playing the same night — but it’s at the Pavilion, meaning the market for ‘80s nostalgia tours remains not only resilient but profitable, particularly when the performers are responsible for some of the biggest pop-rock earworms of that hit-heavy decade. Rick Springfield has long supplemented his “Jessie’s Girl” earnings with successful careers as an author and actor, including roles in True Detective and the Meryl Streep film Ricki and the Flash this summer alone. Long after the “Talking In Your Sleep” days, Detroit power-pop champs the Romantics have become favorites on Little Steven’s Underground Garage, both the satellite-radio channel and the syndicated FM program. Finally, the indefatigable Canadians behind “Lovin’ Every Minute of It” and “The Kid Is Hot Tonite,” Loverboy, have now endeared themselves to multiple generations of weekend warriors.

Catfish & the Bottlemen 
House of Blues, September 23 
A band is doing well in Britain when it is featured on the cover of longstanding music bible NME; it’s doing even better when the cover copy says, “Step aside, Liam!” That’s big talk from even the notoriously excitable UK music press, but thus far the excellently named four-piece Catfish & the Bottlemen have shown all the signs of being a real contender. A clever strategy of setting up shows in the parking lots of gigs by bands like Kasabian quickly got the Bottlemen noticed; from there it was a pretty short hop to Universal Records and 2014’s brash and lofty The Balcony, an album that — while it may not be quite as majestic as vintage Oasis — again confirms how deeply the gritty but stylish sounds of the Strokes have seeped into the water supply of Great Britain’s millennial indie-rockers. 

Dale Watson, Rosie Flores 
Discovery Green, September 24 
Surely Discovery Green will be a fine place to see Dale Watson, but it’ll be hard not to feel a twinge of sadness that he’ll never again play Blanco’s, his Houston honky-tonk home for many years, and now closed for almost two. But life goes on, and the 52-year-old founder of “Ameripolitan” music — basically what we used to call country, until country music turned into watered-down pop and classic rock — is thriving, making his Austin City Limits debut in 2014 and this year releasing Call Me Insane , another excellent album full of both humor (“Heaven’s Gotta Have a Honky-Tonk”), heartbreak (“Burden of the Cross”), a little of both (George Jones tribute “Jonesin’ For Jones”), and plenty of hard twangin’ in between. Joining him Thursday is Rosie Flores, the San Antonio native who has been a maverick and a trailblazer since her first album, 1987’s Rosie Flores , was produced by Dwight Yoakam’s longtime guitarist Pete Anderson. Now a longtime resident of Austin, Flores is a grande dame of rockabilly who can rip up the stage with the best of them; her latest evidence is 2012’s Working Girl’s Guitar .

He was part of Austin's twang supergroup the Twangbangers, formed in 2001 with Redd Voelkaert, Dallas Wayne and Joe Goldmark.

There were big plays against the new-look secondary, and you can't blame John Lovett any longer. 
 
Byron Maxwell, the highly-paid free agent cornerback looked more like Bradley Fletcher than he did his old teammate in Seattle, Richard Sherman. 
 
Sam Bradford threw two interceptions, one on the final last-gasp drive to win the game, ala Mark Sanchez. 
 
And Cody Parkey, who missed two key field goals in a late-season loss to the Washington Redskins, missed wide right on a 44-yard attempt that would have given the Eagles the lead with 2:27 to play. 
 
Here are some other observations from Chip Kelly's first-ever opening-day loss.   
 
Best, or at least longest, Drive Ever : The Eagles third-quarter touchdown drive that culminated with a five-yard touchdown pass from Sam Bradford to DeMarco Murray that cut the score to 20-17 was amazing. 
 
It will go down as a 95-yard drive after the Falcons' punter Matt Bosher put the ball out of bunds at the 5 yardline. The drive, however, withstood four Eagles' penalties, which made it an actual 138 yards of total offense on the drive. 
 
Nickel Defense: Chip Kelly wouldn't reveal what his nickel defense would be all week and then pulled a surprise Monday night.  
 
Safety Chris Maragos, known for his special teams prowess more than his defense, was inserted as a deep safety and base safeties Malcolm Jenkins and Walter Thurmond alternated against the Falcons' slot receiver. 
 
The back-up outside corner appears to be E.J. Biggers, who came in for one play, when Nolan Carroll got shaken up on a play in the third quarter.  
 
Bad Start : The Eagles offense managed just 34 total yards in the first quarter and 14 of those 34 came on a Sam Bradford pass to Darren Sproles on 3rd-and-24. 
 
Worse Start : DeMarco Murray, who came back with two second-half touchdowns, did not get his Eagles career off to a great start. The former Cowboy lost 12 yards on his second run of the night; and on the next play lost two more yards on a reception. 
 
Rotating Linebackers: Defensive coordinator Billy Davis rotated his three inside linebackers — Kiko Alonso, DeMeco Ryans and Mychal Kendricks — as expected. It appeared Ryans was on the field mostly for what they thought would be running downs.   
 
Rotating Wide Receivers: Kelly started the game with rookie Nelson Agholor, veteran Riley Cooper and second-year man Jordan Matthews in his three receiver set. Second-year man Josh Huff was in on the second series for Cooper and continued to rotate in and out of the lineup. Veteran Miles Austin saw considerable action in the second half, especially on the long touchdown drive. 
 
In crunch time on the final two drives, it was mostly Cooper, Agholor and Matthews, with an occasional Austin. 
 
Who was home? : Atlanta has never been known as a football city, at least not a NFL city. Monday night there seemed to be as many Eagles fans in the Georgia Dome as Falcons fans. Whenever the Eagles made a big play, offensively or defensively, the cheers were as loud, or louder, as when the Falcons did the same.

177415,36285a9a-bbe1-4bd4-9dce-caaba3f43aab,You carry your 'microbial cloud' with you,NewsChannel 10,"(HealthDay News) -- In a finding that's sure to alarm germophobes everywhere, scientists say people emit a ""microbial cloud"" of bacteria wherever they may be. 

The study found that air samples could even pinpoint which individual had just left a sealed chamber, based on the makeup of their particular cloud of bacteria. 

""We expected that we would be able to detect the human microbiome in the air around a person, but we were surprised to find that we could identify most of the occupants just by sampling their microbial cloud,"" study author James Meadow, of the University of Oregon, said in a news release from the journal PeerJ . 

The findings were published in the journal on Sept. 22. 

It's long been known that humans are host to a myriad of mostly helpful microbes, both in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin. This colony of organisms is what scientists have dubbed the ""microbiome."" 

Now, the Oregon study finds that people also emit some of their microbiome in a kind of haze around themselves. 

In the study, Meadow's team tested the air around 11 different people while they were each placed alone in a sealed, sanitized chamber. 

The researchers found that the presence of most of the people could be sequenced and identified within four hours of leaving the chamber -- just by the cloud of bacteria in the air they had left behind. 

Different combinations of several groups of bacteria commonly found on and in humans are the key to distinguishing individuals, the research team said. Key species were Streptococcus , usually found in the mouth, and skin germs such as Propionibacterium and Corynebacterium . 

""Our results confirm that an occupied space is microbially distinct from an unoccupied one,"" Meadow said, and ""demonstrate for the first time that individuals release their own personalized microbial cloud."" 

The findings may help improve understanding of how infectious diseases are spread in buildings, or even offer new ways to identify crime suspects, the researchers said.

The online study of 633 U.S. based respondents, conducted between August 7 and September 3, 2015, revealed an audience that is notably engaged, cross-generational and active during all sporting seasons of the year, representing an expanded opportunity for cross-channel marketers in a range of industry sectors. The sample was weighted to be representative of the U.S. population based on age and gender. 

 The Findings 
As football season commences, advertisers and marketers in particular categories are increasingly focused on the sports enthusiast. The world of Fantasy Sports is an emerging gateway to this expanding digital audience. The 1R study showed that what was once a singular demographic, consisting of young men checking stats at work on their desktop during the day, is now a diverse segment -- with women and multiple generations partaking. The expanded audience is connecting across devices during all parts of the day, throughout all sporting seasons of the year. Select findings include: 

 A Closer Look at the Audience Shift 
Traditionally, men have been the main participants in Fantasy Sports and this remains true, as men are more likely than women to participate in Fantasy Sports leagues, 22.8% vs. 5.7%, respectively. Among men, the most active Fantasy Sports league segments are respondents aged 35-44 years (35.7% participate) and 25-34 years (33.3% participate). But the gaps are closing, especially among new players. Here, women are increasingly leveling the playing field in Fantasy Sports league participation. Whereas nine-out-of-ten (89.7%) participants who have been playing Fantasy Sports for a year or more are men -- among new players, in their ""first season,"" nearly half (47.3%) are women. 

Football rules among Fantasy Sports participants -- widely outpacing, more than double, all other leagues for participation. 71.9% of Fantasy Sports participants have been active in a fantasy football league in the past 12 months. This includes 76.1% of male Fantasy Sports fans and 54.1% of female Fantasy Sports fans. 

""The Fantasy Sports enthusiast audience now represents a broad marketing opportunity that includes men and women, is increasingly cross-generational, and persists year-round,"" said Chuck Moran, VP Marketing for RhythmOne. ""This emerging fan profile presents marketers with a unique opportunity to leverage Fantasy Sports content to reach and engage highly targetable audience segments outside of traditionally expected content channels. With the run up to the prime Q4 advertising season, Fantasy Sports properties and content should be considered by a wide array of advertisers -- including CPG, Auto, and Retail -- as the playing field to reach their target consumer.""

Vice News correspondent Jake Hanrahan and cameraman Philip Pendlebury were arrested while filming in the south-east region of Diyarbakir. 
 
They were detained along with a Turkish colleague, who has not been named, while filming clashes between police and youth members of the pro-Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) last Thursday. 
 
They were charged on Monday, allegedly with ""assisting Islamic State"" (Isis), and are due to stand trial in Turkey. 
 
Vice News condemned the accusations as ""baseless and false"", with global rights and press freedom groups calling for the men's immediate release. 
 
Amnesty International said the charges were another example of the Turkish authorities ""suppressing the reporting of stories that are embarrassing to them"". 
 
Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International's Turkey researcher, said: ""It is completely proper that journalists should cover this important story. 
 
""The decision to detain the journalists was wrong, while the allegation of assisting Islamic State is unsubstantiated, outrageous and bizarre.""

He added: ""They are held on pre-trial detention, and they could well be there until it comes to trial. 
 
""In Turkey it is very slow-moving and it could take six months, or even longer, for an indictment to be prepared. It could well not come to trial before six months or more."" 
 
However, this does not mean the men will be held in custody for the duration, as their lawyer will have the opportunity to challenge the detention. 
 
Mr Gardner continued: ""They were detained on the basis of what looks like a tip-off. They were questioned to do with their work, what they were doing, who they were speaking to. And they were asked if they have any connection or relations with Isis or PKK. 
 
""All the questions related to their duties of journalism, and it doesn't look like there was any evidence of criminal activity."" 
 
PEN International and PEN Turkey - which promote literature and freedom of expression - said they ""are extremely concerned"" about the men's detention. 
 
Zeynep Oral, president of PEN Turkey, said: ""It is becoming increasingly difficult to carry out journalistic duties in Turkey. In a period of uncertainty, both in the country and in the region, we are in the greatest need of freedom of expression and the right to know. We ask for justice and the immediate release of journalists doing their jobs."" 
 
Commenting after the men were charged, Kevin Sutcliffe, Vice head of news programming in Europe, said the pair had been charged in an ""attempt to intimidate and censor their coverage"". 
 
Vice said Mr Hanrahan and Mr Pendlebury are experienced reporters, who have together covered the migrant crisis in Calais, the Scottish referendum, republicanism, and various other stories.

384115,04e0f797-dd49-460e-96d2-b35b82d6787a,Poll: Carly Fiorina rockets to No. 2 behind Donald Trump in GOP field,Q13 Fox,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Carly Fiorina shot into second place in the Republican presidential field on the heels of another strong debate performance, and Donald Trump has lost some support, a new national CNN/ORC poll shows . 
 
The survey, conducted in the three days after 23 million people tuned in to Wednesday night’s GOP debate on CNN, shows that Trump is still the party’s front-runner with 24% support. That, though, is an 8 percentage point decrease from earlier in the month when a similar poll had him at 32%. 
 
Fiorina ranks second with 15% support — up from 3% in early September. She’s just ahead of Ben Carson’s 14%, though Carson’s support has also declined from 19% in the previous poll. 
 
Driving Trump’s drop and Fiorina’s rise: a debate in which 31% of Republicans who watched said Trump was the loser, and 52% identified Fiorina as the winner. 
 
During the CNN debate, Fiorina clashed with Trump over his personal attacks and their business records and scored points for her condemnation of Planned Parenthood. 
 
The top three contenders underscore a key theme in the 2016 race: In a jampacked GOP presidential field, the leading candidates are the only ones who have never held political office. 
 
But one established politician has seen his standing rise after flashing foreign policy chops on the debate stage. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida — identified as Wednesday’s winner by 14% of Republicans, putting him second behind Fiorina — is now in fourth place with 11% support, up from 3% in a previous poll. 
 
In fifth place is former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at 9%. He’s followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 6% each, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at 4%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 3%, Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 2% and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania at 1%. 
 
Five other candidates received less than one-half of 1 percentage point support: former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. 
 
Walker’s collapse is especially stark. 
 
Celebrated by conservatives — in the party’s base and its donor class alike — for his union-busting efforts in Wisconsin, Walker at one point led the field in the key early voting state of Iowa. 
 
His support had already dropped to 5% in a CNN/ORC poll in early September, but the bottom appears to have fallen out completely since then — with a second flat debate performance coming after criticism of his disparate answers on issues like birthright citizenship. 
 
Carson was a quiet presence in Wednesday’s debate, but he remains the most popular candidate in the GOP field, with 65% of Republican voters saying they view him favorably, compared with just 10% saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the retired neurosurgeon. 
 
Rubio ranks second in the popularity contest, with 57% viewing him favorably and 16% unfavorably. He’s followed by Fiorina (54% favorable to 17% unfavorable), Huckabee (53% to 28% unfavorable), Cruz (52% to 22%) and Trump (52% to 40%). 
 
The biggest positive movement was in favor of Fiorina, whose favorability rating has climbed by 9 percentage points since August. And the biggest drop hit Trump, who shed 6 percentage points in that same period. 
 
But Trump still stands out on the issues. 
 
About 44% of likely GOP voters say they see Trump as the candidate who could best handle the economy — well ahead of his nearest competitors: Fiorina at 11%, Rubio at 10% and Bush at 8%. 
 
Trump also wins on immigration, with 47% saying he could best address the issue, ahead of second-place Rubio’s 15% and Bush’s 9%. 
 
He even edges Rubio, 22% to 17%, on who could best handle foreign policy. 
 
The poll offered some good overall news for Republicans: 65% of GOP voters said they are either “extremely” or “very” enthusiastic about voting in the 2016 presidential race, compared with 51% of Democrats. 
 
The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 17-19 and surveyed 1,006 adult Americans, including 924 registered voters — 444 of whom are Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP. The margin of error with the Republican results is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

The top three contenders underscore a key theme in the 2016 race: In a jampacked GOP presidential field, the leading candidates are the only ones who have never held political office. But one established politician has seen his standing rise after flashing foreign policy chops on the debate stage. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida — identified as Wednesday’s winner by 14% of Republicans, putting him second behind Fiorina — is now in fourth place with 11% support, up from 3% in a previous poll. In fifth place is former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at 9%. He’s followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 6% each, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at 4%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 3%, Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 2% and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania at 1%. Five other candidates received less than one-half of 1 percentage point support: former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker’s collapse is especially stark. Celebrated by conservatives — in the party’s base and its donor class alike — for his union-busting efforts in Wisconsin, Walker at one point led the field in the key early voting state of Iowa. His support had already dropped to 5% in a CNN/ORC poll in early September, but the bottom appears to have fallen out completely since then — with a second flat debate performance coming after criticism of his disparate answers on issues like birthright citizenship. Carson was a quiet presence in Wednesday’s debate, but he remains the most popular candidate in the GOP field, with 65% of Republican voters saying they view him favorably, compared with just 10% saying they have an unfavorable opinion of the retired neurosurgeon. Rubio ranks second in the popularity contest, with 57% viewing him favorably and 16% unfavorably. He’s followed by Fiorina (54% favorable to 17% unfavorable), Huckabee (53% to 28% unfavorable), Cruz (52% to 22%) and Trump (52% to 40%). The biggest positive movement was in favor of Fiorina, whose favorability rating has climbed by 9 percentage points since August. And the biggest drop hit Trump, who shed 6 percentage points in that same period. But Trump still stands out on the issues. About 44% of likely GOP voters say they see Trump as the candidate who could best handle the economy — well ahead of his nearest competitors: Fiorina at 11%, Rubio at 10% and Bush at 8%. Trump also wins on immigration, with 47% saying he could best address the issue, ahead of second-place Rubio’s 15% and Bush’s 9%. He even edges Rubio, 22% to 17%, on who could best handle foreign policy. The poll offered some good overall news for Republicans: 65% of GOP voters said they are either “extremely” or “very” enthusiastic about voting in the 2016 presidential race, compared with 51% of Democrats. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted September 17-19 and surveyed 1,006 adult Americans, including 924 registered voters — 444 of whom are Republicans and independents who lean toward the GOP. The margin of error with the Republican results is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. 38.907192 -77.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Carly Fiorina shot into second place in the Republican presidential field on the heels of another strong debate performance, and Donald Trump has lost some support, a new national CNN/ORC poll shows .

524245,40f115b1-7780-48ca-a5a3-04b570ef90cb,Arraignments delayed for Davis murder suspects,Davis Enterprise,"WOODLAND — Two suspects in a downtown Davis homicide made their first court appearances Wednesday but did not enter pleas, saying they wanted to first hire private defense attorneys to handle their cases. 
 
“I’m going to be hiring an attorney I’ve used in the past. I need to get ahold of him,” Martyn Alex Contreras, 25, told Yolo Superior Court Commissioner Kent O’Mara during the afternoon arraignment hearing. “If you could give me two weeks it would be highly appreciated.” 
 
His co-defendant, 21-year-old Zackary Thomas Sandeno, said, “I can’t give you an answer at this time” when O’Mara asked whether he could afford to hire a lawyer, but said he’d prefer private counsel “if possible.” 
 
The two Vacaville residents face murder and criminal street-gang activity charges in connection with Saturday’s death of Peter Alexander Gonzales, a 23-year-old Los Angeles resident who was staying in Davis with his family for his sister’s wedding on Sunday. 
 
Police say was Gonzales was fatally stabbed at the KetMoRee nightclub at Third and G streets while trying to protect his two brothers as they were being assaulted. A third suspect, Sandeno’s brother Joseph Gregory Sandeno, 20, has yet to be apprehended. 
 
O’Mara postponed the defendants’ arraignments for nearly two weeks, ordering both back to court on Oct. 5 — the day before their alleged victim, the youngest of five siblings, would have turned 24. O’Mara also confirmed their no-bail holds at the Yolo County Jail. 
 
Neither police nor prosecutors have offered details as to why the killing is being considered a gang-related crime, and Supervising Deputy District Attorney Garrett Hamilton declined to comment as he left the courtroom Wednesday. 
 
Watching the brief proceedings from the courtroom gallery were several members of Gonzales’ family, including parents Henry and Emma Gonzales. 
 
Afterward, Henry Gonzales said they attend the hearing “to make sure that justice is done, so those individuals who were in there could see that (Peter) had parents, and so that we could have closure in this.” 
 
The couple also noted that their family isn’t the only one impacted by the violent crime. 
 
“I’m sure their family is devastated as well,” Henry Gonzales said of the defendants. “It’s unfortunate, it’s a tragedy, and this is not something that anyone should have to go through.” 
 
They urged anyone who knows the whereabouts of the at-large Joseph Sandeno or who may be harboring him, “be careful out there — have him turn himself in so nobody else gets hurt.” 
 
The Gonzaleses said they planned to take their son’s body home to Southern California today and prepare for services to be held in October. 
 
Meanwhile, as the Davis community approaches what’s expected to be another busy downtown weekend, police say they’ll continue to work with nighttime establishments to focus on public safety. 
 
On Wednesday night, police held their regularly scheduled meeting with bar owners and managers, bouncers, Alcoholic Beverage Control officials and the city fire marshal to discuss a range of issues including security, occupancy limits, fake IDs, and how to best handle fights or problem crowds. 
 
“Basically what we’re trying to do is get everybody on the same page,” Darren Pytel, Davis’ assistant police chief, said of the meetings that are held each fall and spring when the city’s nightlife tends to ramp up. “It’s a lot of exchange of information back and forth.” 
 
For decades, downtown Davis has offered a busy bar scene, and while the number of calls for service haven’t increased dramatically in recent years, “what we are seeing is an increase in the level of violence,” Pytel said. Fistfights, for example, have led to displays of knives and guns, and gang activity also is on the rise. 
 
And while UC Davis students once comprised the bulk of downtown crowds, “Davis has now become a regular destination for our nightlife,” Pytel added, noting the number of out-of-town residents who appear on the local arrest log. 
 
Police and city staff also are considering some future measures, such as the possible establishment of an ordinance that specifically addresses nightclub operations, and looking at service-call statistics to determine whether further actions are needed at locations where officers are summoned the most. 
 
But generally, “it appears that everyone wants the same thing — they want the downtown to be a safe, good destination,” Pytel said.

And while UC Davis students once comprised the bulk of downtown crowds, “Davis has now become a regular destination for our nightlife,” Pytel added, noting the number of out-of-town residents who appear on the local arrest log. Police and city staff also are considering some future measures, such as the possible establishment of an ordinance that specifically addresses nightclub operations, and looking at service-call statistics to determine whether further actions are needed at locations where officers are summoned the most. But generally, “it appears that everyone wants the same thing — they want the downtown to be a safe, good destination,” Pytel said. — Reach Lauren Keene at lkeene@davisenterprise.net or 530-747-8048.

BALTIMORE, MD, September 18, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tonight, a photography exhibit honoring community leader and philanthropist Shoshana Cardin, and her profound role in the struggle for Soviet Jewry, opened at Chizuk Amuno in Pikesville, MD. The exhibit, commemorating the 25 years since the opening of the gates of the Soviet Union to free Jewish emigration, was prepared by Limmud FSU (former Soviet Union), together with The Jerusalem Post. 

Shoshana Cardin, a world-renowned philanthropist and communal activist known by heads of state, diplomats, and celebrities alike, was an integral leader in the Free Soviet Jewry movement. From 1988 to 1992, Cardin served as chairperson of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, and in 1990, was elected to head the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, as the only woman to hold that role. Cardin led numerous delegations to the Soviet Union and met with Soviet officials and leaders to negotiate for the release of thousands of refuseniks who were prohibited from leaving the Soviet Union. 

Cardin, who is 89 today, offered remarks at the reception: ""The Soviet Union managed to keep Jews waiting. There was no real reason. They were hostages. It was a difficult time. We were faced with the problem of a dissolving Soviet Union, where nothing was centralized, and a huge group of people anxious yet unable to leave. We knew it had to happen. We knew that millions were waiting for us."" 

Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD), a relative of Mrs. Cardin, was present: ""I've been in Congress since 1987, and my first day in Congress I joined the caucus on Soviet Jewry. And shortly thereafter, Shoshana was the president of the National Council for Soviet Jewry, so every night I had to report back what I was doing to help save Soviet Jews. I was there at the march in Washington in 1989. I've seen it through every facet. We are so proud of the role Shoshana played. She stood up to the commercial interests of this country. She said, America stands for something more fundamental than just commerce -- we stand for basic human rights. Shoshana stood up to presidents. She stood up to the State Department. And she stood up to the Soviet Union. Jews are safer today because of Shoshana's leadership on behalf of Soviet Jews. She taught us that people can change policy. There's no question that in the State Department, this was not a top priority then. The fight for Soviet Jewry changed the landscape of politics in our country."" 

""I think of all us are extraordinarily proud of so many things my mother has done on behalf of the Jewish community and her work on Soviet Jewry,"" said Sanford Cardin, president of the Schusterman Foundation and son of Shoshana. ""It was a seminal moment in Jewish history, and to know she led such a leading role in this movement, is both humbling and inspiring for all of us. It has helped all her children and grandchildren recommit their lives to helping the Jewish people because of the role model she was."" 

The ""Let My People Go"" exhibition is composed of photographs selected from archives and public and private collections, some of them by the distinguished American photographer Robert A. Cumins, with detailed explanatory captions. The exhibit begins with the epic struggle of the Jews in the USSR for the right to emigrate - the ""Refuseniks"" and ""Prisoners of Zion"", and goes on to illustrate the worldwide campaign for their release, known as ""Let my People Go!"", the opening of the gates and finally, some of the achievements made by Soviet Jews after attaining their freedom. The exhibition, curated by Asher Weill, was launched in Jerusalem Post annual conference in New York in June 2015, and will be shown around the United States, in Israel and in many Jewish communities and at Limmud FSU & Jpost events around the world. 

This exhibit illustrates just a few aspects of the struggle in the USSR, as well as the worldwide campaign on behalf of the struggle, the high-profile activists who headed the movement including leaders from the Baltimore area community such as Shoshana Cardin; scenes of joyful homecoming; and finally, a glimpse at some prominent Russian-born individuals who are having an impact on Jewish life today, in Israel and elsewhere, where more than one million Russian-speaking new free immigrants have changed the face of the nation. 

""There's no better person to honor, with our exhibit commemorating this momentous occasion 25 years after opening the gates, than Shoshana Cardin,"" said Sandy Cahn, co-founder of Limmud FSU. ""She was involved in the struggle, from witnessing it from the point of refuseniks, to leading the American-Jewish response in fundraising and lobbying to pressure the Soviet regime, to ensuring that the aliyah of over 1 million Jews was successful in every aspect. She is a modern-day hero for us. It is fitting that Limmud FSU empowers this successful generation of young Russian-speaking Jews and connects them to their heritage, to their history -- in which great leaders like Shoshana took a major part."" 

Ronit Hassin - Hochman the Jerusalem Post executive director: The exhibition tells one of the greatest stories of the Jewish people, in photos: the struggle for freeing Soviet Jewry, and its success. The Jerusalem Post, the Jewish people's leading newspaper for the past 80 years, has extensively covered the historical events and is proud of the fact the exhibit is now traveling the globe. The Jerusalem Post will continue bringing together the world's Jewish communities with Israel and the Jewish people here through its publications and website and our conferences and events, both in Israel and the diaspora. 

The exhibition is open to the public at the synagogue (8100 Stevenson Road, Pikesville, MD 21208) Monday through Friday from 10 am to 3 pm. For additional information, please call the synagogue office at 410-486-6400.

About Limmud FSU 
Limmud FSU, founded nearly ten years ago by Chaim Chesler (Israel) and Sandra Cahn (New York), reaches out to thousands of young Russian speakers, not only in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but wherever there are Russian-speaking Jewish communities, especially in Israel, the United States, Canada and Australia. It provides a unique pluralistic, egalitarian and all-embracing educational and cultural experience, with no connection to any particular organization or political group, but concentrates on the search for roots, national pride and a sense of unity and an affinity to the State of Israel.

And shortly thereafter, Shoshana was the president of the National Council for Soviet Jewry, so every night I had to report back what I was doing to help save Soviet Jews. I was there at the march in Washington in 1989. I've seen it through every facet. We are so proud of the role Shoshana played. She stood up to the commercial interests of this country. She said, America stands for something more fundamental than just commerce -- we stand for basic human rights. Shoshana stood up to presidents. She stood up to the State Department. And she stood up to the Soviet Union. Jews are safer today because of Shoshana's leadership on behalf of Soviet Jews. She taught us that people can change policy. There's no question that in the State Department, this was not a top priority then. The fight for Soviet Jewry changed the landscape of politics in our country."" ""I think of all us are extraordinarily proud of so many things my mother has done on behalf of the Jewish community and her work on Soviet Jewry,"" said Sanford Cardin, president of the Schusterman Foundation and son of Shoshana. ""It was a seminal moment in Jewish history, and to know she led such a leading role in this movement, is both humbling and inspiring for all of us. It has helped all her children and grandchildren recommit their lives to helping the Jewish people because of the role model she was."" The ""Let My People Go"" exhibition is composed of photographs selected from archives and public and private collections, some of them by the distinguished American photographer Robert A. Cumins, with detailed explanatory captions. The exhibit begins with the epic struggle of the Jews in the USSR for the right to emigrate - the ""Refuseniks"" and ""Prisoners of Zion"", and goes on to illustrate the worldwide campaign for their release, known as ""Let my People Go!"", the opening of the gates and finally, some of the achievements made by Soviet Jews after attaining their freedom. The exhibition, curated by Asher Weill, was launched in Jerusalem Post annual conference in New York in June 2015, and will be shown around the United States, in Israel and in many Jewish communities and at Limmud FSU & Jpost events around the world. This exhibit illustrates just a few aspects of the struggle in the USSR, as well as the worldwide campaign on behalf of the struggle, the high-profile activists who headed the movement including leaders from the Baltimore area community such as Shoshana Cardin; scenes of joyful homecoming; and finally, a glimpse at some prominent Russian-born individuals who are having an impact on Jewish life today, in Israel and elsewhere, where more than one million Russian-speaking new free immigrants have changed the face of the nation. ""There's no better person to honor, with our exhibit commemorating this momentous occasion 25 years after opening the gates, than Shoshana Cardin,"" said Sandy Cahn, co-founder of Limmud FSU. ""She was involved in the struggle, from witnessing it from the point of refuseniks, to leading the American-Jewish response in fundraising and lobbying to pressure the Soviet regime, to ensuring that the aliyah of over 1 million Jews was successful in every aspect. She is a modern-day hero for us. It is fitting that Limmud FSU empowers this successful generation of young Russian-speaking Jews and connects them to their heritage, to their history -- in which great leaders like Shoshana took a major part."" Ronit Hassin - Hochman the Jerusalem Post executive director: The exhibition tells one of the greatest stories of the Jewish people, in photos: the struggle for freeing Soviet Jewry, and its success. The Jerusalem Post, the Jewish people's leading newspaper for the past 80 years, has extensively covered the historical events and is proud of the fact the exhibit is now traveling the globe. The Jerusalem Post will continue bringing together the world's Jewish communities with Israel and the Jewish people here through its publications and website and our conferences and events, both in Israel and the diaspora. The exhibition is open to the public at the synagogue (8100 Stevenson Road, Pikesville, MD 21208) Monday through Friday from 10 am to 3 pm. For additional information, please call the synagogue office at 410-486-6400. Photos attached. About Limmud FSU Limmud FSU, founded nearly ten years ago by Chaim Chesler (Israel) and Sandra Cahn (New York), reaches out to thousands of young Russian speakers, not only in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but wherever there are Russian-speaking Jewish communities, especially in Israel, the United States, Canada and Australia. It provides a unique pluralistic, egalitarian and all-embracing educational and cultural experience, with no connection to any particular organization or political group, but concentrates on the search for roots, national pride and a sense of unity and an affinity to the State of Israel. --- Press release service and press release distribution provided by http://www.24-7pressrelease.com","Senator Ben Cardin: ""Soviet Jewry Taught Us That People Can Change Policy"" At ""Let My People Go"" Photography Exhibit BALTIMORE, MD, September 18, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Tonight, a photography exhibit honoring community leader and philanthropist Shoshana Cardin, and her profound role in the struggle for Soviet Jewry, opened at Chizuk Amuno in Pikesville, MD.

774103,4240b9cc-8509-43df-bcae-c3d17be3ceb0,Ricky Martin brings his 'One World Tour' to US after debut of 'La Banda' on Univision,CJAD 800,", EDT. NEW YORK, N.Y. - Ricky Martin begins the U.S. leg of his ""One World Tour"" on Tuesday, while evoking his days with Menudo as a judge and executive producer of Univision's new reality show ""La Banda."" 

""I am happy to be part of this great production. Being an executive producer is very important to me because it opens doors to a world of infinite possibilities,"" the Puerto Rican star told The Associated Press in a recent interview. 

""We started with Univision with the idea of eventually moving to other English-speaking networks to look for another 'banda,'"" he said in reply to a question about franchising, noting that many ""European countries have already bought the project."" 

The singing competition, with a judging panel that includes Italian singer Laura Pausini and Spanish singer-songwriter Alejandro Sanz, was created by Simon Cowell. The goal is to create a Latin boy band that can sing in both English and Spanish. 

""Being able to go back to the beginning of my career has been the best part,"" said Martin, 43, who started in the '80s in the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. ""I have loved reliving with these boys the uncertainty of one's career beginnings. ... My mission is to be an open book and share with them everything that has worked for me in my career and everything that hasn't worked for me."" 

""La Banda"" debuted Sunday, two days before Martin's concert at the Axis at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, to be followed by more than 20 shows in cities including Houston, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Miami, as well as Toronto and Montreal in Canada. 

""Is a very demanding show for a very demanding audience,"" Martin said. ""It is a great show that includes the new hits and the old, as well as those heart-wrenching ballads that we've been singing throughout the years"" and his best-known party anthems. 

The tour started in April in New Zealand and included stops in Australia and Mexico. 

Martin said about 150 people, including musicians, dancers, technicians and engineers, work on the tour. ""It practically feeds 150 families!"" 

He said his 6-year-old twins Matteo and Valentino start asking what's coming next when they spend a few months in the same place. 

""We live the circus life,"" he said. ""We are circus people.""

This weekend, Ana Laura Cordeiro completed an epic career-comeback story by winning gold in the over 60kg female division at ADCC 2015. Cordeiro's story is one of great success, heartache, victory, and pain. Cordeiro exploded on to the scene in the 2000's with an impressive, aggressive grappling game, which helped her amass an unbeaten competitive jiu-jitsu record before injury almost forced her into retirement. A nasty back injury forced Cordeiro to stop competing for over 4 years. At times it looked like Cordeiro would never make it back on to the mats, but this weekend, Cordeiro overcame the odds to take home gold.

With Ana Laura Cordeiro's victory and with Gabi Garcia suffering defeat, the women's ADCC over 60kg division provided a lot of talking points.
ADCC Women's +60kg

Official results:

1st place: Ana Laura Cordeiro

2nd place: Jessica Oliveira

3rd place: Gabi Garcia
What was the high point of the tournament?

As amazing as Cordeiro's overall performance was, there was one moment that truly shocked the world in this division. Jessica Oliveira, a brown belt, defeated Gabi Garcia, who is perhaps the most dominant female grappler of the last decade, in a massive upset. Oliveira's upset will go down as a legendary moment in ADCC folklore and in my eyes is the tournament's second greatest upset, only being bettered by Eddie Bravo's victory over Royler Gracie in 2003.
Where do the finalists go from here?

Ana Laura Cordeiro will be hoping that she can stay fit. A healthy Cordeiro is truly unstoppable and with all things going well, we could see Cordeiro have success at the Pan American games and the World Jiu-Jitsu championships over the next year. The future is very bright for Cordeiro.

Jessica Oliveira has impressed a lot of people with her performances at ADCC this year and by no means should she feel any shame in losing to Ana Laura Cordeiro. Oliveira will come back stronger and under the tutelage of Henrique Machado, she will undoubtedly come back even better.
Watch now, later, or never?

302427,7b220fe5-9f26-4304-b61c-bf6630bc5bfe,The Dope on Dope,LikeTheDew.com,"Should marijuana be legalized? No, of course not. Why? Because of the drug’s downside. And because of its upside. 
 
First the upside. Let’s face it: the weed is huge fun. But people, what are you thinking? That it’s okay to have a bag of fun just lying around the house? To be indulged in whenever? What’s happened to our puritan heritage? You remember when H. L. Mencken said that puritanism is the fear that somebody, somewhere, is having more fun than you are? Well, what the great sage of Baltimore apparently failed to appreciate was that this is a good fear, an important fear, a society-stabilizing fear. 
 
Most important, it’s a motivating fear. After all, the puritan doesn’t respond to this fear by going out and having more fun. He goes out and works harder, accomplishes more, makes more money, and sneers more fiercely at the free-gigglers. In other words, he keeps the world moving, and I think we can all agree that that’s an essential chore. 
 
So the upside, fun, is problematical. Not that fun, per se, is bad. But fun is the reward state, not the perpetual state. First we do something useful and productive, something to serve the public good, like thanking veterans for their service. Point is—we earn fun. It’s not complicated. And the people who say that “dope” can transform the things we do to earn fun into . . . fun? Well, we’re not listening to those people. OK? Because that’s crazy. 
 
Now, the downside. It ain’t pretty. First we’re going to have to take a candid look at the effects of marijuana, chief of which by any measurement is raging paranoia. Of course, this is another fear, and an equally useful one. What would you do if could get high and not worry about being high, not even think about the worst possible person knocking on the door or the horrible news a telephone call might bring. Of course you would, and so would everybody else. Can you imagine it? All that fun on the loose? Scary. But that’s what we’ll have if pot is legalized. 
 
A final point, a bit personal, about us older folks. Another universally recognized effect of marijuana is that it makes you stupid. Believe me, we geezers don’t need any help in that department. If you’re going to put your old people on a sofa in front of the TV, fine, give ‘em a little pot. Otherwise, no. I already spend enough time wandering from room to room, picking up magazine here, opening a drawer there. So don’t count on us oldsters to get behind your legalization thing. We’ll lose our dignity soon enough without your help. 
 
Well, hell. It’s a young people’s game anyway. All those millionaire hippie kids at Apple and Facebook and Google, blowing the world away with their gizmos and gewgaws. Probably got joint dispensers in the break room. What does a nattering old man know? 
 
Just this: There’s a bigger picture here. The prospect of legal marijuana, alarming as it is, merely illustrates a much larger sociocultural phenomenon: funcreep. Think about it: Sunday alcohol sales, legal gambling, gay marriage, gay Boy Scout leaders. Wow! People are having fun in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. 
 
Hey, I know we got a lot of problems in this country: racial unease, injustice, economic inequality, war. I almost hate to add to the list. But, frankly, I’m worried. Fun is out of control.

Of course, this is another fear, and an equally useful one. What would you do if could get high and not worry about being high, not even think about the worst possible person knocking on the door or the horrible news a telephone call might bring. Of course you would, and so would everybody else. Can you imagine it? All that fun on the loose? Scary. But that’s what we’ll have if pot is legalized. A final point, a bit personal, about us older folks. Another universally recognized effect of marijuana is that it makes you stupid. Believe me, we geezers don’t need any help in that department. If you’re going to put your old people on a sofa in front of the TV, fine, give ‘em a little pot. Otherwise, no. I already spend enough time wandering from room to room, picking up magazine here, opening a drawer there. So don’t count on us oldsters to get behind your legalization thing. We’ll lose our dignity soon enough without your help. Well, hell. It’s a young people’s game anyway. All those millionaire hippie kids at Apple and Facebook and Google, blowing the world away with their gizmos and gewgaws. Probably got joint dispensers in the break room. What does a nattering old man know? Just this: There’s a bigger picture here. The prospect of legal marijuana, alarming as it is, merely illustrates a much larger sociocultural phenomenon: funcreep. Think about it: Sunday alcohol sales, legal gambling, gay marriage, gay Boy Scout leaders. Wow! People are having fun in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. Hey, I know we got a lot of problems in this country: racial unease, injustice, economic inequality, war. I almost hate to add to the list. But, frankly, I’m worried. Fun is out of control. John Yow John Yow has written two books about birds, both published by UNC Press: The Armchair Birder: Discovering the Secret Lives of Familiar Birds (2009) and The Armchair Birder Goes Coastal: The Secret Lives of Birds of the Southeastern Shore (2012). His blog, ""From Pumpkinvine Creek"" (frompumpkinvinecreek.blogtspot.com) is generally concerned with the fate that awaits birds and all other species if we don't stop trashing the planet.

We're back with our latest instalment of La Liga's team of the weekend, featuring all 10 games over the past few days in Spain's top flight. 

Our selection process means we analyse every game to pick out a star XI from the weekend's fixtures, choosing the best players to form a viable formation—this time we go for an old Carlo Ancelotti favourite: the Christmas tree formation, 4-3-2-1. Only the best players in each position from this weekend's action make the cut, leading, as always, to several tough decisions along the way. 

In addition to individual form, we take into account such factors as opposition quality and overall contribution to the team's display. 

Here are the players who make the team from Jornada 4 in La Liga. 

Keylor Navas was placed in an unfortunate and unusual position around the transfer window closure, being his team's No. 1 goalkeeper—yet trying to be replaced in extremely public fashion by his club. It didn't happen, he stayed and now is setting about frustrating every attack he comes up against. 

Another clean sheet this weekend against Granada was no easy feat; Real were lucky an offside decision went their way on one occasion, but every other attack was thwarted by Navas' bravery and reflexes. More than once he dived out at the feet of the forward and a late tip over the bar was important too. 

Five games, five clean sheets, a new club record and, per Marca, just 10 minutes off Iker Casillas' best-ever streak at the club—it's a fantastic start for Keylor. 

This week we've got a fair number of players in our XI from the big three of Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid—but some of the smaller teams in La Liga also picked up important victories and had good performers too. 

Right-back Damian Suarez, now at Getafe, was one of them. 

The Uruguayan was impressive at both ends of the pitch in the 1-0 home win over Malaga, being a great outlet for his side down the flank and delivering a string of balls in toward his forwards but also remaining strong in defence and stopping Malaga's threat from wide with a series of interceptions and challenges. 

Our system this week incorporates two attacking midfield players and the first of those is Espanyol's Marco Asensio, on loan from Real Madrid and a huge performer in the 3-2 win over Real Sociedad. 

Asensio started as the 10 but also played wide and almost as a second forward as Espanyol changed systems a number of time during the game, adapting to falling behind early on but then having a man advantage for the second half. No matter where he played, Asensio continually demanded to receive possession and looked to turn immediately to run at La Real's defence or else play a clever pass into space. 

It was his run behind the defence which saw the game's turning point, a red card for Geronimo Rulli for bringing Asensio down, while the resulting penalty was netted for the equaliser. Asensio played a big part in Espanyol's second-half revival and went off to huge applause from the away fans and bench at 2-1 late on in the match.

A new study of more than 500 Black and Latino college students has confirmed that many encounter obstacles after enrolling in college without adequate financial resources.

""Students were surveyed in the fall, winter and spring of freshman year,"" said Micere Keels, associate professor in comparative human development at the University of Chicago, who led the study. ""At each time-point, approximately 35 percent reported having difficulty paying their bills, being upset that they did not have enough money and being concerned that they would not be able to afford to complete their degree.""

The report is the first of a series that will be released from the Minority College Cohort Study, for which Keels is the principal investigator. The study tracks the emerging adult trajectory of Black and Latino college freshmen from five public and private universities in Illinois.

Students who started college with a high level of financial distress fell into one of three groups. The first group is students who enrolled knowing there was an unmet need that would have to be paid for out of pocket, but hoped that somehow they could find a way to pay it before a hold was placed on their account.

The second group is students who enrolled believing there was no unmet need but the final amount of aid received was lower than expected, or made housing or other changes without realizing that it would create unmet need.

The third group is students who, because of limited financial knowledge, believed that financial aid would cover everything and did not budget for living expenses such as food and activity fees. For students without access to any additional credit, from family or banks, incidental expenses add up and lead to stopping-out.

Students in the study entered college in the fall of 2013 and will be followed for six years, regardless of whether they leave college. They were recruited from five Illinois universities: DePaul University, Loyola University, Northern Illinois University, the University of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The report is available on the project's website.

""This project focuses on Black and Latino students because while there has been substantial narrowing of racial and ethnic gaps in college enrollment, there has been no narrowing of the number that matters most--persistence through to degree attainment,"" Keels said. Consequently, disproportionate numbers of Blacks and Latinos are entering adulthood with college debt but without a degree.

Nationally, approximately 40 percent of Black and 52 percent of Latino freshmen obtain their degree within six years, compared to 63 percent of White and 70 percent of Asian students. Black and Latino students also have significantly more student debt than White and Asian students. For example, approximately 43 percent of Black and 30 percent of Latino graduates have more than $30,500 in student debt, compared to 25 percent of White and 10 percent of Asian students. Consequently, broadening access without increasing persistence disproportionately harms Black and Latino students.

""What we don't know but need to know is the number of students who leave college with debt but without a degree--how many and how much-- and particularly the racial and ethnic gaps in these numbers,"" Keels said.

The study recommends that universities proactively send out three questions campus-wide to help them quickly identify students in financial distress who are in need of follow-up counseling. The questions cover how much difficulty they are having in paying their bills, how upset or worried they are because they do not have enough money to meet expenses, and how concerned they are that they do not have the finances that will enable them to complete their degrees.

Among the study's key findings: This study was supported in part by a grant from the William T. Grant Foundation.

Bournemouth's transfers rated: 8/10 

Eddie Howe might be the new ""wheeler dealer"" in town after securing several deals, none more shrewd than bringing in Glenn Murray on deadline day or signing Max Gradel.

Best bit of business:  Howe added proven Premier League talent (think Boruc and Distin) and brought in some exciting players like Atsu and Gradel. 


Worst bit of business:  Failing to sell Stephane Zubar outright.

All is well in Iceland.

Rick is safely here with me here at Hotel Holt in Reykjavik.  Yes, some participants from the first group are still here and the second group has arrived and are, by now, all ensconced in their rooms at Hotel Holt in Reykjavik!  Week II Yoga and Hot Springs Retreat officially begins tomorrow morning with breakfast.

Just got back from the Blue Lagoon.  Even though all I kept hearing about was how long the lines would be or how crowded it would be, the visit to the Blue Lagoon was really worthwhile!  The water was an incredible turquoise blue.  The weather was extremely windy and raining and the water a pampering warm 38 degrees C (100 F).

This was not the best day for photos!  The winds were really strong and so was the rain.  These photos were taken from inside looking out at the lagoon. Actually I CAN'T believe that I forgot to bring my bathing suit (left it behind at Minniborgir Cottages since I will be back there tomorrow night and I only packed a day bag for the city)  and so I nominated myself to be the official photographer for the group...my plan to photograph the group in the Blue Lagoon back-fired because the winds were so strong that the Blue Lagoon was in ""Lock-Down""mode, which means there was only one way to get  out to the lagoon and that was to swim to it through a small opening door in the water.  The winds were so strong that if you opened a door, it could fly off the hinges and hurt/kill someone, so every door was locked shut.  I took photos through the windows and at one time, begged a staff member to open a door for me so I could take a photo.  I somehow sweet talked the guy, and, against all rules, he opened the door for me, but the camera almost flew out of my hands and I nearly got swept off my feet!  He never let go of my arm. Quickly inside again. He tugged me back in!  The rain drops on the windows made for blurry photos, but I really wanted to post a little something on the Blue Lagoon!

Had I brought my swimsuit, I would not have taken a single photo, so it was meant to be after all.  I still have next week to go to the Blue Lagoon again, this time to soak in the water!

A few facts about the Blue Lagoon:

Features of the Blue Lagoon include a Waterfall (yes, you can actually sit under a waterfall!), a silica mud bath (you can smear the white silica mud on your face, let it dry and wash it off and rediscover a new face beneath the washed away mud), and a Sauna and Steambath  (how good can it get???).

Facts:

	The amount of geothermal seawater in the Blue Lagoon is 6 million liters.
	It takes 40 hours for the Blue Lagoon water to renew itself, in a natural way.
	The distance below the surface to the origin of the geothermal seawater is 6,500 ft or 1,981 meters.
	The lava field surrounding the Blue Lagoon is 800 years old.
	The average temperature of the Blue Lagoon is 100 F or 38 C
	The active ingredients found in the Blue Lagoon geothermal seawater are algae, silica, and minerals.
	The deepest the Blue Lagoon gets is 1.6 meters.  Most areas, are very shallow!

UK and Ireland,"By LONDON/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Britain's second-largest steelmaker, SSI UK, said on Friday it was halting operations at its Redcar plant in northeast England, calling into question the future of its business and putting 2,000 jobs at risk.

The company, a unit of Thailand's largest steelmaker Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) , said a sharp decline in steel prices had hurt its business.

Thai banking sources told Reuters that SSI has debts of about 47-48 billion baht ($1.3 bln) related to its UK business and was negotiating with creditors on a debt restructuring, with talks expected to conclude next week. Media reports have said that SSI UK has missed several debt repayments. 

""It is with great regret that we have had to make this announcement. Our decision follows a major deterioration in steel prices affecting our business during the course of this year,"" Cornelius Louwrens, SSI UK's business director and chief operating officer, said in a statement. 

""We are taking this pause in production in order to re-evaluate and assess the situation following the outcome of ongoing discussions with our various stakeholders, including government and suppliers.""

Britain's steel industry is in crisis, the government said on Thursday during a debate on the sector that followed reports of problems at SSI. 

Producing steel profitably is difficult in Britain due to cheap imports and a strong currency, plus relatively high energy costs and ""green"" taxes imposed on heavy industry that are some of the highest in the world. The sector currently employs about 20,000 people directly, down from 200,000 in the 1970s.

The Redcar plant is located in an economically deprived region of the UK and locals fear permanent closure could put at risk thousands more jobs indirectly related to steelmaking.

""This is disappointing news,"" British Business Minister, Anna Soubry, said after SSI's announcement, adding government officials had met with SSI and union leaders. 

""The government stands ready to assist workers where needed,"" she said.

""Government can’t fix the price of steel but we are doing what we can to help."" 

Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, the industry trade body, said the government was not doing enough.

""The time for warm words has passed,"" he said. ""We need a clear indication from government that it will honour its commitment to compensate steel and other energy-intensive industries from the cripplingly high cost of energy. Failure to do so could mark a potentially disastrous tipping point for the industry."" 

Britain's biggest steelmaker, Tata Steel , said in July it could cut more than 700 jobs as it had been hit by cheap imports and high energy costs.

SSI UK said discussions will be held as soon as possible with trade unions and employee representatives. It added it would retain the Redcar plant in conditions that would allow a restart ""at an appropriate point"".

""This is devastating news. We will be seeking urgent talks with SSI management to find out the full extent of the impact this will have on both SSI employees and contractors,"" said Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of Community, a trades union. 

DEBT IMPLICATIONS

Thai banking sources said SSI's debts related to its UK business would have significant implications on the Thai banking sector if they are reclassified as non-performing loans.

In July, Krung Thai Bank , Siam Commercial Bank and Tisco Bank made extra provisions to cover increased risks related to syndicated loans of 44 billion baht ($1.3 billion) to SSI. 

SSI bought the Redcar plant from Tata Steel in 2011, bringing cheer to locals as it revived 160 years of steelmaking.

Directed by Jon Favreau (“Iron Man”), based on Rudyard Kipling’s timeless stories and inspired by Disney’s classic animated film, “The Jungle Book” is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who’s been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he’s ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don’t exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire. The all-star cast also includes Lupita Nyong'o as the voice of the fiercely protective mother wolf Raksha, and Giancarlo Esposito as the voice of wolf pack’s alpha male Akela. “The Jungle Book” seamlessly blends live-action with photorealistic CGI animals and environments, using up-to-the-minute technology and storytelling techniques to immerse audiences in an enchanting and lush world.

Van Gaal said the 19-year-old, signed from Monaco for £36million up front and a possible total fee of £58.8million, had been signed for the club's ""next manager"" - and suggested that would be his current assistant Ryan Giggs. 
  Louis van Gaal, pictured, reportedly admitted the fee paid for Anthony Martial was ""ridiculous""   
Speaking alongside Giggs at an event in Manchester for executive United season ticket-holders, Van Gaal was quoted by The Times as saying: ""I have not bought Martial for me - I have bought him for the next manager of Manchester United."" 

			 
He added of Giggs: ""I feel I am introducing the next manager of Manchester United."" 



 
Van Gaal said of the Martial fee: ""It was a ridiculous amount of money, but it's the crazy world we are in."" 

The Dutchman also claimed the Red Devils were quoted ""£10million more"" for a player than other clubs. 

He also rejected criticism of United's recent style of football and results from former players, including Gary Neville and Paul Scholes, saying: ""It makes me sick because they should know that it takes time."" 

Meanwhile, United said they did not wish to comment on a separate report in The Times that senior players have raised concerns with Van Gaal that his training methods were stifling their creativity.

Over on Pure Xbox , two new JRPGs have been announced, and they are Xbox One exclusives. One is scheduled to launch in Q1 2016 while the other isn’t quite nailed down but expected sometime between 2016 and 2017. 
 
I am curious to follow this trend of which games end up as PlayStation exclusives as compared to Xbox One exclusives. Final Fantasy has already shifted from being a PlayStation exclusive to being cross platform, and plenty of other JRPGs are opting instead to release on 3DS and Vita instead of PS4 or Xbox One. However, I think the demand is still out there for massive scale JRPGs – just look at all the excitement around FFXV. There is potential for JRPGs to make a come back, and maybe even help to sell consoles again, but they would have to be something really special. Perhaps the Final Fantasy VII remake will help during its timed release, but it’s true exclusives that really make a difference.

Johnny Depp​ says if his wife Amber Heard is jailed over their dogs' quarantine fracas, he would ""assault"" Barnaby Joyce.

Speaking to TV host Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Depp said this would allow him to join Heard, his wife, in prison.

""I'd just fly to Australia and assault that man,"" he says. ""So that I could go to jail.""

Heard has been ordered to face a Gold Coast court on November 2 on charges of illegally bringing Pistol and Boo into Australia in May. She could face up to 10 years jail time and a fine of $100,000 if found guilty.

Depp, who was in the country filming Pirates of the Caribbean, has not been charged.

Asked if he had ""smuggled"" the pair's dogs, Pistol and Boo, into Australia in May, Depp said he and Heard were under the impression they ""had all the paperwork done for the dogs"".

""We were there with the dogs in front of everybody,"" he says.""There might have been other things smuggled. Well they seemed to miss that bit. Might have been. Could have been.""

The feud between the Pirates of the Caribbean star and the Abbott government minister, which sparked international furore and became known as ""The War on Terrier"", began after the two Yorkshire Terriers arrived in Australia via private jet.

Joyce said Depp would have to take his dogs back home, because they breached biosecurity laws, ""or we're going to have to euthanise them.""

Kimmel showed a clip of Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce making the threat during a doorstop interview at Parliament House.

""What kind of a maniac is this?"" Kimmel says. ""He's going to kill your dogs if you don't send them back to California.""

Depp nods placatingly.

""You know, maybe, maybe, he's just doing his job,"" he says. ""You know this, sort of, weird, sweaty-pated gut man man who decided that two five-, six-inch Teacup Yorkshire terriers would harm the country in some way.

""'He's got a point. Especially when you consider that Australia has the most poisonous creatures on earth. Everything will kill you in minutes.""

683629,0c88dce7-9b3e-47bf-8e55-56f69c5c600b,Russia Says Syria's Assad Is Ready to Share Power with Opposition,VICE,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is ready to hold snap parliamentary elections and could share power with a ""healthy"" opposition. 

Russia, along with Iran, has been Assad's principle international ally in the war that has raged in Syria for four-and-a-half years and has claimed a quarter of a million lives. 

Moscow has made clear it does not want to see Assad toppled and has seized on gains made by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq to urge his foreign foes, including the United States and Saudi Arabia, to work with Damascus to combat the common enemy. 

""We really want to create some kind of an international coalition to fight terrorism and extremism,"" Putin told journalists on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, saying he had spoken to US President Barack Obama on the matter. 

""We are also working with our partners in Syria. In general, the understanding is that this uniting of efforts in fighting terrorism should go in parallel to some political process in Syria itself,"" Putin said. 

""And the Syrian president agrees with that, all the way down to holding early elections, let's say, parliamentary ones, establishing contacts with the so-called healthy opposition, bringing them into governing,"" he said.

Moscow wants the US-led coalition carrying out air strikes on Islamic State militant positions to coordinate with the Syrian and Iraqi armies and moderate anti-Assad rebel groups on the ground, as well as Kurdish forces. 

Assad's enemies have refused to cooperate with Damascus, fearing that would help legitimise his rule in Syria, where the West and Gulf states say he is part of the problem, not the solution, and must go. 

A flurry of recent high-level diplomatic contacts have so far failed to yield a breakthrough with the question over Assad being the main point of contention. 

""If it's impossible today to organise joint work directly on the battlefield between all those countries interested in fighting terrorism, it's indispensable to at least establish some sort of coordination between them,"" Putin said. 

He noted that the chiefs of general staff of armed forces of countries ""sitting close"" to the conflict visited Moscow recently on that. He gave no details. 

Putin also said the West had itself to blame for the migrant crisis that has seen hundreads of thousands of people fleeing the Middle East via the Mediterranean Sea and land routes across the Balkans, with many dying trying to reach the European Union. 

Russia criticises the West, especially the United States, for leading to the overthrow of Moscow-allied leaders in Iraq and Libya, where radical and extremist groups are now roaming. 

""Naturally, first and foremost this is the policy of our American partners. Europe follows this policy blindly under the so-called allies' obligations, and then takes the brunt of it itself,"" Putin said.

Fairfax, VA (PRWEB) September 28, 2015 

Rose Marie Miller, an office manager for Coastal Radiology Associates, PLLC, in New Bern, N.C., is the winner of a special RBMA U travel scholarship made possible through a private donation by another member. 

“Awarding travel scholarships that allow more up-and-coming radiology professionals to attend RBMA conferences is part of our important role in developing the next generation of radiology business leaders,” said Daphne Gawronski, RBMA Director of Communications and Development. “The learning, networking and mentoring relationships that form at conferences are incredibly valuable to members at the beginning of their careers in radiology, and our experienced members appreciate this. The fact that this additional scholarship was made possible through one member’s generous gift is but one example of how our members strive to help each other.”

Miller, 51, is married and the mother of two sons who now attend college at North Carolina State University and Belmont Abby College. After helping to raise her family as a working mother, she is eager to now focus on advancing her career.

“I was very excited to win,” she said. “My career development has up until this point mostly involved working full time, raising my children and putting them through college. It is exciting to now pursue rounding out my formal education and training. The RBMA helps your career and opens up so many doors for you. I want to thank Coastal Radiology Associates for supporting the RBMA U online classes I’ve taken and allowing me to attend RBMA conferences. With sons still in college, the scholarship is definitely a big help and allows me to give back to the practice.” 

Miller’s job as office manager for Coastal Radiology makes her responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations and activities of the practice. One of her goals for her education is to become an even stronger team member at the practice and use what she learns to become a better manager and mentor herself. Just as others helped her, she wants to help the employees she now supervises grow in their careers. 

Prior to her current position, Miller was clerical manager with a dermatology group in New Bern, N.C., for more than eight years and assisted in opening and staffing of the new clinic as well as managing the clerical staff. She also assisted in opening New Bern Outpatient Diagnostic Center and worked there as an office manager for 11 years. 

Miller is part of a certified pet therapy team and volunteers at Carolina East Medical Center and assisted living homes on weekends along with her 101-pound therapy dog Bella Moose.

Analytical Framework, Concepts, Definitions, and Classifications  Definition:  Turkey applies the Special Trade System rules for foreign trade statistics. Foreign trade statistics include goods which enter/leave the statistical territory of Turkey from/to other countries and are placed: 

-under the customs normal export and import procedures,  
-under customs inward and outward processing procedures. 

Classification:  The classification used for compiling Turkey's foreign trade statistics is the Harmonized System (HS) 12-digit. The first 8-digit (CN) is international and the last 4-digit is national. Furthermore, the data are available in SITC Rev.4, SITC Rev.3, SITC Rev.2, ISIC Rev.4, ISIC Rev.3, ISIC Rev.2, BEC, CPA, CPC and NST2007 classifications. 

European Union  country classification Geonomenclature is used in classification of countries. 
Classification of product group by technology intensity was prepared by OECD based on ISIC Rev.3 classification.

International and regional guidelines: 
There are no important differences between Turkey's methodology reported in the IMF SDDS and relevant international or regional standards.       
 
Scope of the Data  
 Transactions coverage:  Normal exports and imports, inward and outward processing regime, financial leasing and border trade are included in the statistics. In terms of foreign trade statistics, customs warehouses, free zones    and  duty-free shops in Turkey are considered as beyond the customs frontier. 
 
 Items not considered as imports and exports include: Shuttle trade, transit trade, temporary trade, goods for and after repair and maintenance, operational leasing monetary gold and transactions under $100. 
 
Geographical coverage:  Geographical coverage is based on customs boundaries. Statistical territory is the custom territories except free zones and warehouses. 
 
Unrecorded activity:  Data on shuttle trade are not included. Although TURKSTAT and the Central Bank of Turkey makes estimates on shuttle trade for balance of payments data, these are not included in the foreign trade figures disseminated by TURKSTAT.  
  
Accounting Conventions  
Conversion to unit of account:  The Central Bank's daily exchange rates are used to convert the currencies. 
 
·     Valuation:  Exports are valued free on board (FOB) and imports on cost, insurance and freight (CIF).  
  
Characteristics of Basic Data Sources  
Sources:  Main data source is customs declarations. Data of electricity, natural gas and crude petroleum is received from enterprises. 
   Type of data collected:  Main statistical items collected are: Goods flow, the reference period,  customs, commodity code, partner country , the nationality of the means of transport at the  frontier, mode of transport, customs procedure, statistical value (export FOB/import CIF), net  mass (kg), supplementary unit, delivery terms, nature of transaction, type of payment .   
Basis of country data:  Country of origin for imports and country of last known destination for exports.  

In the January-June press releases data of previous and current year, in the July-December press releases only data of current year is published, temporarily. 
  
Compilation Practices  Processing system:  The program BILGE (SOFIX is French version) is used by customs. 

Processing site:  Turkey's foreign trade data are processed only by the Turkish Statistical Institute. 

Time of recording transactions:  Time of recording is the date on the declaration and refers to the date of clearance.    
Revisions  
Other subjects  
Geographic detail:  The data are available by province, country of origin (for imports) and country of final destination (for exports). A breakdown by country groups is also available.  

Commodity detail:  The data are available in HS 12-digit. 

Seasonal and calendar adjustment:   Seasonal and calendar related effects prevent observing the general tendency of data because of their temporary characteristics. Therefore, identification of seasonal patterns of short term indicators plays crucial role in order to make reliable comparisons between consecutive periods.   



Method Used: Currently,  Turkstat  carries out the seasonal adjustment of Foreign Trade Statistics,  using TRAMO-SEATS methodology based on ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model estimation developed by the Banco de Espana and also suggested by Eurostat. The software that is used for the application of this method  is TRAMO-SEATS for Windows (TSW). 
 
Seasonal Adjustment Process : The process of seasonal and calendar adjustment of Foreign Trade Statistics begins at the end of each year with determination of the specification of models of the next year.  This specified model structure is kept fixed throughout the year to adjust seasonally and/or calendar effects. At the end of the year, just like the previous year, specification of econometric estimation models for the following year is determined. The identified process repeats itself in a cyclical manner each year. 
 
Total export and import figures and subtitles by SITC and BEC classification have bee seasonally and calendar adjusted. While 20 subtitles of external trade series contain both seasonal and calendar effects,   5 subtitles contain neither of these effects,  3 subtitles include only calendar effects.   
 
Direct or Indirect Approach:  Seasonally and calendar adjusted figures of total export and import have been produced by indirect approach. The individual subtitles of External Trade series by SITC and BEC classification are seasonally adjusted and then aggregated to derive seasonally and calendar adjusted totals. The indirect approach has the advantage of easy calculation of contributions to growth from components of main aggregates and advantage of retaining additivity. 
 
Publication: Adjusted data has been published in 3 different ways. 
 
ü   “ Calendar adjusted ” data is derived from unadjusted data by removing calendar and holiday originated effects. Calendar adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the same month/period of the previous year. 
 
  
 
ü   “Seasonally adjusted” data is derived from unadjusted data by removing effects originating from seasonal effects . Seasonally adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the previous month/period 

 
ü     If unadjusted data contains both calendar and holiday, and seasonal effects, “seasonally and calendar adjusted” data is derived by removing these effects. Seasonally and calendar adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the previous month/period. 



      Province data : Trade by province is prepared according to the province where the head office of firm is located in. The main data source of business registers is the Revenue Administration Department’s registers.   In addition, for the enterprises having more than 20 employees full enumeration method is used. Provinces of head office can be change year by year. This situation sould be considered while comparing the data from year to year.

Scope of the Data Transactions coverage: Normal exports and imports, inward and outward processing regime, financial leasing and border trade are included in the statistics. In terms of foreign trade statistics, customs warehouses, free zones and duty-free shops in Turkey are considered as beyond the customs frontier. Items not considered as imports and exports include: Shuttle trade, transit trade, temporary trade, goods for and after repair and maintenance, operational leasing monetary gold and transactions under $100. Geographical coverage: Geographical coverage is based on customs boundaries. Statistical territory is the custom territories except free zones and warehouses. Unrecorded activity: Data on shuttle trade are not included. Although TURKSTAT and the Central Bank of Turkey makes estimates on shuttle trade for balance of payments data, these are not included in the foreign trade figures disseminated by TURKSTAT. Accounting Conventions Conversion to unit of account: The Central Bank's daily exchange rates are used to convert the currencies. · Valuation: Exports are valued free on board (FOB) and imports on cost, insurance and freight (CIF). Characteristics of Basic Data Sources Sources: Main data source is customs declarations. Data of electricity, natural gas and crude petroleum is received from enterprises. Type of data collected: Main statistical items collected are: Goods flow, the reference period, customs, commodity code, partner country , the nationality of the means of transport at the frontier, mode of transport, customs procedure, statistical value (export FOB/import CIF), net mass (kg), supplementary unit, delivery terms, nature of transaction, type of payment . Basis of country data: Country of origin for imports and country of last known destination for exports. In the January-June press releases data of previous and current year, in the July-December press releases only data of current year is published, temporarily. Compilation Practices Processing system: The program BILGE (SOFIX is French version) is used by customs. Processing site: Turkey's foreign trade data are processed only by the Turkish Statistical Institute. Time of recording transactions: Time of recording is the date on the declaration and refers to the date of clearance. Revisions Other subjects Geographic detail: The data are available by province, country of origin (for imports) and country of final destination (for exports). A breakdown by country groups is also available. Commodity detail: The data are available in HS 12-digit. Seasonal and calendar adjustment: Seasonal and calendar related effects prevent observing the general tendency of data because of their temporary characteristics. Therefore, identification of seasonal patterns of short term indicators plays crucial role in order to make reliable comparisons between consecutive periods. Method Used: Currently, Turkstat carries out the seasonal adjustment of Foreign Trade Statistics, using TRAMO-SEATS methodology based on ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model estimation developed by the Banco de Espana and also suggested by Eurostat. The software that is used for the application of this method is TRAMO-SEATS for Windows (TSW). Seasonal Adjustment Process : The process of seasonal and calendar adjustment of Foreign Trade Statistics begins at the end of each year with determination of the specification of models of the next year. This specified model structure is kept fixed throughout the year to adjust seasonally and/or calendar effects. At the end of the year, just like the previous year, specification of econometric estimation models for the following year is determined. The identified process repeats itself in a cyclical manner each year. Total export and import figures and subtitles by SITC and BEC classification have bee seasonally and calendar adjusted. While 20 subtitles of external trade series contain both seasonal and calendar effects, 5 subtitles contain neither of these effects, 3 subtitles include only calendar effects. Direct or Indirect Approach: Seasonally and calendar adjusted figures of total export and import have been produced by indirect approach. The individual subtitles of External Trade series by SITC and BEC classification are seasonally adjusted and then aggregated to derive seasonally and calendar adjusted totals. The indirect approach has the advantage of easy calculation of contributions to growth from components of main aggregates and advantage of retaining additivity. Publication: Adjusted data has been published in 3 different ways. ü “ Calendar adjusted ” data is derived from unadjusted data by removing calendar and holiday originated effects. Calendar adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the same month/period of the previous year. ü “Seasonally adjusted” data is derived from unadjusted data by removing effects originating from seasonal effects . Seasonally adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the previous month/period ü If unadjusted data contains both calendar and holiday, and seasonal effects, “seasonally and calendar adjusted” data is derived by removing these effects. Seasonally and calendar adjusted data should be used in comparisons regarding the previous month/period. Province data : Trade by province is prepared according to the province where the head office of firm is located in. The main data source of business registers is the Revenue Administration Department’s registers. In addition, for the enterprises having more than 20 employees full enumeration method is used. Provinces of head office can be change year by year. This situation sould be considered while comparing the data from year to year.","Foreign Trade Statistics Press Releases Foreign Trade Statistics - Period : July 2015 Exports and imports decreased by 16.2% and 8.7%, respectively Read more >> Statistical Tables and Dynamic Search Metadata Analytical Framework, Concepts, Definitions, and Classifications Definition: Turkey applies the Special Trade System rules for foreign trade statistics.

Seeing stuff like this makes my blood boil. It makes me sick. A bunch of people beating down on a guy for wearing a different jersey, stomping him when he’s on the floor, etc. is downright evil. There’s no other word for it. He is literally crawling on the floor trying to take protection between someone’s legs. 

And to that 4’9″ fat chick who thinks she can kick a dude in the chest and then get angry about it when a good samaritan taps her and tells her to get off? I hope you enjoy posting Instagram photos in XXL jerseys, full-piece bathing suits, and big rimmed sunglasses for the rest of your life, you ugly slob. Get real. 

Rant over. 

Ninja Edit: Here’s the full text from the Facebook message in case you’re thinking this guy deserved it. He didn’t: 

The Viking fan in the video and a 49er fan NOT in the video were talking smack to each other, getting into each others faces. A lot of fans from both sides were telling both people to stop and just walk to their cars. The Viking fan shoved his wife into a barrier to try to get to the 49er fan, then at that point the 49er fan walked away from the situation and that’s when the Viking fan may have got a little cocky. The Viking fan turned around and addressed everyone behind him (mostly 49er fans). He said ” what’s up, any of you fuckers want some?!” At that point everyone went silent for 2 seconds then as the Viking fan was turning around to walk away, the 49er fan in the black (at the beginning of the video who threw the first punch) tackled him to the ground. That’s where the video starts. 

Here’s my quick opinion: 

Don’t talk shit like that in enemy territory…he instigated the whole entire situation. Sure the 49er fans may have gone a little too far, but when you poke your chest out asking “who wants it” you’re going to get it 

I would like to add to this story: 

ZERO cops were on the scene. ZERO. Santa Clara Police Department were no where to be found. Hopefully they can show up and arrest the parties in this video. Also give recognition to the security guard in the yellow jacket who was first on the scene, brave man getting in the middle of that brawl.",441,"who thinks she can kick a dude in the chest and then get angry about it when a good samaritan taps her and tells her to get off?

The board certified plastic surgeons at Advanced Aesthetics are pleased to offer patients the latest in breast implant technology

ATLANTA 

""There are several benefits to shaped gel implants, including increased safety and a more natural look,"" says Dr. Paul D. Feldman, one of the board certified plastic surgeons at Advanced Aesthetics. ""For the right patient, these implants can offer a beautiful, long-lasting result."" 

The texture, placement technique, and highly cohesive gel of these implants make them one of the safer options currently available. According to board certified plastic surgeon Dr. Edward S. Gronka, there is a lower complication rate, including a decreased risk of capsular contracture-a condition that involves the painful development of scar tissue that can tighten and squeeze the breast implant. ""Capsular contracture continues to be a concern for breast augmentation patients, though this uncomfortable condition is becoming increasingly rare,"" states Dr. Gronka. ""Shaped gel implants further lessen the risk, giving many women increased peace of mind.""

Additionally, shaped gel implants offer a number of aesthetic benefits for the right patient. Although these implants are firmer than previous generations, the cohesive silicone gel provides a stable though flexible consistency that resembles the look and feel of natural breast tissue. The shape and texture of the implant also reduces the risk of rippling and implant visibility, particularly for more petite patients.

""While highly cohesive silicone gel implants aren't the right fit for everyone, there are a number of women who benefit greatly from them,"" says board certified surgeon Joseph Raniere, Jr., M.D. points out. ""Women without much natural breast tissue, athletes, and breast reconstruction patients are all wonderful candidates.""

A benefit all patients can enjoy is the reduced recovery timeline: gummy bear implants offer faster visible results and don't require the usual six month settling period typical of other implants. Over time, they are also less likely to rupture, collapse, or develop other long-term complications that can arise.

 RICHMOND, Va. , Sept. 8, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion (NYSE: D ) announced today that it has agreed to enter into a partnership with SunEdison, Inc. (NYSE: SUNE ), in which it would sell 33 percent of its ownership in 425 megawatts of solar generating capacity for approximately $300 million , subject to working capital and certain other adjustments. Under the terms of the agreement, SunEdison has a future option to buy all or a portion of Dominion's remaining 67 percent ownership. 
Included in the agreement are 24 projects in California , Connecticut , Georgia , Indiana , Tennessee and Utah . Fifteen of the projects entered service in 2013 and 2014. The remaining projects either have been completed or have expected in-service dates in 2015.  All have long-term power purchase agreements with local electricity providers. 
 
Dominion expects to pay down debt with the cash proceeds. The transaction will require approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
 
Thomas F. Farrell II , chairman, president and chief executive officer, said: 
 
""We began acquiring and developing long-term contracted solar projects in 2013 to build the knowledge and expertise in constructing, owning and operating utility-scale solar power before bringing that technology to Virginia . Meanwhile, during the past decade Dominion has worked to reduce risk and divest non-core assets and businesses. Our focus is shifting from constructing contracted solar to constructing utility solar in Virginia , where we expect to develop 400 megawatts of generating capacity by 2020."" 
 
Dominion also announced that it has agreed to enter into a joint venture with SunEdison to develop the 210-megawatt Three Cedars Solar project in Utah . Dominion and SunEdison each will have a 50 percent interest in Three Cedars. 
 
SunEdison will oversee construction of the projects and day-to-day operation of the facility once it has come online, which is expected in 2016. Three Cedars is expected to qualify for the federal Investment Tax Credit. Dominion will receive the majority of the federal tax benefits from the projects for the first several years, including the investment tax credit. 
 
Three Cedars consists of three sites located in Iron County, Utah . The project has secured 20-year power purchase agreements, interconnection agreements and engineering, procurement and construction contracts.

(businesspress24) - SURREY, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/11/15 --   Adanac Molybdenum Corporation (""Adanac"" or the ""Company"") (TSX VENTURE: AUA) announces that is has entered into a letter of intent (the ""Letter of Intent"") with Whitebox Advisors, LLC (""Whitebox""), which acts as investment advisor for several significant shareholders of the Company. The Letter of Intent sets out the intention of the Company and Whitebox (collectively, the ""Parties""), on a non-binding basis, to engage in negotiations to attempt to agree upon and execute a definitive agreement (the ""Definitive Agreement"") pursuant to which Whitebox would agree to acquire, by way of a plan of arrangement (the ""Proposed Transaction""), all of the issued and outstanding shares of Adanac that Whitebox does not currently own. The Letter of Intent provides for a cash purchase price of $350,000 (the ""Proposed Purchase Price"") which represents the value of Adanac''s non-cash assets. Adanac estimates that approximately $4.3 million in cash (the ""Cash Holding"") would also be distributed to all shareholders, on a pro-rata return of capital basis as part of the Proposed Transaction. 

Period of Exclusivity 

The Parties have agreed, on a binding basis, to a period of exclusivity until 5 pm Eastern on September 23, 2015 (the ""Exclusivity Period""), unless earlier terminated, during which the Company will not solicit a proposal that might be competitive with the Proposed Transaction and during which the Company and Whitebox will work to finalize the terms of the Definitive Agreement. 

Structure and Timing of Proposed Transaction 

Subject to the Parties entering into a Definitive Agreement, the Proposed Transaction is expected to be carried out by way of a plan of arrangement under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and will be subject to the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Adanac shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to be held in early November, 2015. All shares held by Whitebox will be excluded from voting pursuant to the requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101"") as a result of Whitebox being a related party to the Company by virtue of its affiliates holding in excess of 10% of the Company''s outstanding shares. 
   
It is anticipated that closing of the Proposed Transaction will subject to certain other conditions, including receipt of British Columbia court, TSX Venture Exchange and other regulatory and third party approvals, and is expected to close shortly after the special meeting. An information circular is expected to be mailed to Adanac shareholders in October, 2015. 

A supplemental news release will be issued in the event that a Definitive Agreement is entered into or the Letter of Intent is terminated. There can be no assurance that a Definitive Agreement will be entered into or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated. Further, readers are cautioned that those portions of the Letter of Intent that describe the Proposed Transaction, including the Proposed Purchase Price, are non-binding. In addition, the amount of the Cash Holding may be reduced by the costs of the Company incurs in connection with the Proposed Transaction. If completed, the Proposed Transaction will result in Adanac being delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange.

Period of Exclusivity The Parties have agreed, on a binding basis, to a period of exclusivity until 5 pm Eastern on September 23, 2015 (the ""Exclusivity Period""), unless earlier terminated, during which the Company will not solicit a proposal that might be competitive with the Proposed Transaction and during which the Company and Whitebox will work to finalize the terms of the Definitive Agreement. Structure and Timing of Proposed Transaction Subject to the Parties entering into a Definitive Agreement, the Proposed Transaction is expected to be carried out by way of a plan of arrangement under the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and will be subject to the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Adanac shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders expected to be held in early November, 2015. All shares held by Whitebox will be excluded from voting pursuant to the requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101"") as a result of Whitebox being a related party to the Company by virtue of its affiliates holding in excess of 10% of the Company''s outstanding shares. It is anticipated that closing of the Proposed Transaction will subject to certain other conditions, including receipt of British Columbia court, TSX Venture Exchange and other regulatory and third party approvals, and is expected to close shortly after the special meeting. An information circular is expected to be mailed to Adanac shareholders in October, 2015. A supplemental news release will be issued in the event that a Definitive Agreement is entered into or the Letter of Intent is terminated. There can be no assurance that a Definitive Agreement will be entered into or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated. Further, readers are cautioned that those portions of the Letter of Intent that describe the Proposed Transaction, including the Proposed Purchase Price, are non-binding. In addition, the amount of the Cash Holding may be reduced by the costs of the Company incurs in connection with the Proposed Transaction. If completed, the Proposed Transaction will result in Adanac being delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange.

The nation’s Treasury will sell a net 51 billion euros ($57 billion) in debt this year, after previously revising its target down to 53 billion euros in July from 55 billion euros at the start of the year. The government forecasts the economy growing 3.3 percent this year, more than twice the average for the 19-nation currency bloc. 

“The net issuance target has been reduced from 55 to 51 billion euros,” de Guindos told Bloomberg in Madrid. “That is the new target in line with the evolution of the fiscal deficit.” 

Net issuance is the sovereign debt created in addition to that which merely refinances maturing securities. 

Lower fuel prices and interest rates close to record lows are helping to spur economic growth and bolster tax revenue for the Spanish government. That has reduced its financing needs from bond markets. 

Spain’s government debt, which was little changed during most of Wednesday, rose in the last hour of trading. The 10-year bond yield closed down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, at 2.13 percent.

369711,10b61902-2819-476c-bcf2-08f0df97222f,New Study Shows Upgrading to Latest AMD Processor Reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Personal...,Stockhouse Canada,"-  Results of an AMD ( NASDAQ : AMD ) carbon footprint analysis of its 6 th Generation A-Series Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), codenamed ""Carrizo,"" show that using the new processor can result in a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous generation APU. The study results are based on the widely accepted Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) established by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and were announced today during an AMD sponsored media panel on energy efficient information technology. Research shows that 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies have established public targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions 1 . 

""Creating low-power, energy efficient products is a key element of our business strategy, and in turn, we are working alongside our customers to reduce the environmental footprint of technology while relentlessly improving performance,"" said Mark Papermaster, senior vice president and chief technology officer, AMD. ""The results from the carbon footprint study for the latest AMD APU demonstrate our commitment to continued energy efficiency gains, sustainability, and lower operating costs for consumers and enterprises."" 

An enterprise customer upgrading from 100,000 PCs using the previous generation AMD processor to the 6 th Generation AMD A-Series APU could save an estimated 4.9 million kilowatt hours of electricity -- or roughly $495,000 -- and 3,350 metric tons of CO2 (equal to powering 461 homes) over a 3-year product service life 2 . 

In 2014, AMD announced an ambitious goal of improving the typical use energy efficiency of its mobile APUs by 25 times by 2020, from a 2014 baseline 3 . Meeting the 25x20 target requires increasing the pace of efficiency gains by using new power management features and innovative designs. The energy efficiency improvements needed to achieve this goal outpace the historical efficiency trend predicted by Moore's Law by at least 70 percent 4 . That means that in 2020 a computer could accomplish a task in one fifth the time of a personal computer in 2014 while consuming on average less than one fifth the power. Using a car analogy, this rate of improvement would be like turning a 100-horsepower car that gets 30 miles per gallon into a 500-horsepower car that gets 150 miles per gallon in only six years. 

""Reducing carbon emissions is the right thing to do for the environment, and it brings the additional benefit of reducing how much individuals and businesses spend on electricity as well,"" said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst, Tirias Research. ""AMD made an audacious promise fifteen months ago to improve the energy efficiency of their processors by 25 times by 2020. A projected 50 percent reduction in usage-phase greenhouse gas emissions by the 6th Generation AMD A-Series APU is further proof the company is making serious progress in its commitment to a cleaner planet and lower energy bills."" 

The 6th Generation AMD A-Series APU is the first product introduced under the 25x20 initiative and represents a huge leap in energy efficiency for AMD mobile APUs. 

AMD was recently recognized on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the fourteenth year in a row. In May, AMD was named to Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine's list of the  100 Best Corporate Citizens for the third consecutive year.

The study results are based on the widely accepted Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) established by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and were announced today during an AMD sponsored media panel on energy efficient information technology. Research shows that 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies view carbon emissions reduction as one of their priorities; yet, companies continue to be unclear how affected carbon emissions can be improved. New research provided by TCO Diagnostics, a Carbon Lighthouse project , reveals that as 60 percent of servers are powered by APUs, the amount of carbon emissions that can be reduced is significant.

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio faces the contempt-of-court hearing Wednesday over his decision to let his officers conduct immigration patrols 18 months after they were told to stop them. The sheriff, whose territory covers metropolitan Phoenix, also is being called into court for his office's failure to turn over traffic-stop recordings before the profiling trial and bungling a plan to gather the videos once they were publicly revealed. Other subjects examined at the hearings include allegations that Arpaio launched an investigation of the profiling case's judge in a failed bid to get him disqualified and that his officers pocketed personal items seized from people during traffic stops and busts. The six-term sheriff could face civil fines and later he'll be called into criminal court on similar grounds. ""I want to apologize to the judge that I should have known more of his court orders,"" Arpaio testified during an initial round of contempt hearings in April. ""It slipped through the cracks."" He is expected to testify about his investigation involving U.S. District Judge Murray Snow, who delivered a setback to Arpaio in 2013 when he concluded that sheriff's deputies had profiled Latinos during regular traffic and immigration patrols. The judge confronted Arpaio about the investigation during the April hearings. Weeks later, the judge said the investigation was intended to show an alleged conspiracy between him and the U.S. Justice Department, which was pressing a separate civil rights lawsuit against Arpaio. The sheriff, who in the past has been accused of retaliating against his critics, had insisted that he hadn't investigated Snow. Instead, he said his office examined allegations that wiretaps had been put on emails and phones of local judges and lawyers defending him in the Justice Department case. Still, Arpaio acknowledged that he has lost confidence in the informant who provided the tip. Documents that have since been released show that Arpaio's office was pushing the informant for anything to back up his claims about the conspiracy on the eve of the April contempt hearings.",377,"plan to gather the videos once they were publicly revealed.

Ergon Energy says it has joined a legal push challenging the methodology used by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to determine the power firm's revenue allowance for the next five years. 

The AER's current draft decision would make power companies spend drastically less on maintaining and upgrading their networks, and that could lower household power prices. 

But Ergon chief executive Ian McLeod says adjusting to tighter revenue streams so quickly without picking up more work in other areas could hit his workforce. 

""If we implemented the AER decision as it is now, in it's draft, and without picking up alternative work such as new meters etcetera, it equates to about 800 (jobs),"" Ergon chief executive Ian McLeod said. 

He said the legal challenge lodged with the Australian Competition Tribunal wouldn't change his company's submission to the AER for it's final determination, due later this year. 

Mr McLeod said a ruling in his company's favour could possibly change the way the regulator considered its submission on the revenue allowance. 

Alliance of Electricity Consumers has claimed if Ergon and Energex were granted their requested revenue allowance by the AER, household power bills in Queensland double over the next five years. 

But Mr McLeod said Ergon was trying hard to balance the cost for consumers with the safety and reliability of the network. 

Energy and Water Supply Minister Mark Bailey said the regulator had made it absolutely clear its final determination would lead to better outcomes for consumers. 

""I'm not going to speculate on decisions that haven't been made,"" he said.

936140,727e341b-70d8-4449-8b0e-d3bafd57de0b,"Reds fall to Mets 12-5, get 90th loss for 1st time since '07",Kentucky.com,"CINCINNATI — The Reds fell behind by a dozen runs and played more than three hours while wrapping up their 90th loss of the season.

Yep, the bad numbers keep piling up.

Lucas Duda hit a pair of three-run homers on Friday night, and Noah Syndergaard dominated with his 99-mph fastball while pitching into the eighth inning, leading the Mets to a 12-5 victory over Cincinnati that moved New York to the verge of its first playoff spot since 2006.

The Mets' magic number for clinching the NL East was reduced to one with Washington's 8-2 loss to Philadelphia.

By contrast, the Reds have lost 90 games for the first time since 2007, the year before Dusty Baker took over as manager and led Cincinnati to three 90-win seasons and playoff appearances. They're a long way from those days, just trying to finish out the season.

They've lost their last six games.

""I'm hanging in there,"" starter Anthony DeSclafani said. ""I don't feel great, but it's September. Nobody feels great.""

Duda was the catalyst as New York stretched its road winning streak to nine games, matching the club record from 2006. He had a pair of RBI doubles on Thursday night in a 6-4 win, and hit three-run homers off DeSclafani (9-12) and Tony Cingrani on Friday. His six RBIs were a career high.

""The mistakes he made, they put the barrel on,"" manager Bryan Price said of DeSclafani. ""He didn't have a lot of strikeouts. All of our guys, the mistakes they made, they put the barrel on. They fought off some good pitches.""

Curtis Granderson added a three-run shot in the eighth as the Mets built a 12-0 lead.

Syndergaard (9-7) allowed five hits and struck out 11 over 7 2-3 innings, the fourth time he's reached double-digit strikeouts. He retired 16 in a row over one stretch.

The Mets are 24-15 all-time at Great American Ball Park, the best winning percentage by any NL team. They've excelled on the road overall, going 28-11 since July 1.

The road has been Syndergaard's weak spot. The rookie came into the game only 1-5 with 4.47 ERA on the road, compared to 7-2 at Citi Field with a 2.57 ERA. He's been much better lately, winning his last two road decisions.

Syndergaard also had a pair of hits, including an RBI single in the second inning. Duda's 23rd homer made it 4-0 an inning later and extended the Mets' club-record streak of at least three runs in each of their last 29 road games.

ROOKIE NUMBERS

DeSclafani became the first Reds rookie to make 30 starts in a season since Johnny Cueto in 2008.

TRAINER'S ROOM

Mets: Juan Uribe pinch hit and left the game after aggravating a chest injury suffered last Sunday. X-rays were negative.

Reds: Manager Bryan Price plans to use RHP Michael Lorenzen for one-inning appearances out of the bullpen the rest of the way to limit his pitches. The rookie has made 21 starts and thrown 109 2-3 innings.

UP NEXT:

Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (12-7) can clinch the title for New York. He's 1-0 with a 2.25 ERA in three career appearances against the Reds. He won his only start at Great American Ball Park in 2012.

Reds: LHP John Lamb (1-3) has never faced the Mets. Lamb, acquired from the Royals in the trade for Johnny Cueto, is 1-0 with a 1.80 ERA in his last three starts.

""I don't feel great, but it's September. Nobody feels great."" Duda was the catalyst as New York stretched its road winning streak to nine games, matching the club record from 2006. He had a pair of RBI doubles on Thursday night in a 6-4 win, and hit three-run homers off DeSclafani (9-12) and Tony Cingrani on Friday. His six RBIs were a career high. ""The mistakes he made, they put the barrel on,"" manager Bryan Price said of DeSclafani. ""He didn't have a lot of strikeouts. All of our guys, the mistakes they made, they put the barrel on. They fought off some good pitches."" Curtis Granderson added a three-run shot in the eighth as the Mets built a 12-0 lead. Syndergaard (9-7) allowed five hits and struck out 11 over 7 2-3 innings, the fourth time he's reached double-digit strikeouts. He retired 16 in a row over one stretch. The Mets are 24-15 all-time at Great American Ball Park, the best winning percentage by any NL team. They've excelled on the road overall, going 28-11 since July 1. The road has been Syndergaard's weak spot. The rookie came into the game only 1-5 with 4.47 ERA on the road, compared to 7-2 at Citi Field with a 2.57 ERA. He's been much better lately, winning his last two road decisions. Syndergaard also had a pair of hits, including an RBI single in the second inning. Duda's 23rd homer made it 4-0 an inning later and extended the Mets' club-record streak of at least three runs in each of their last 29 road games. ROOKIE NUMBERS DeSclafani became the first Reds rookie to make 30 starts in a season since Johnny Cueto in 2008. TRAINER'S ROOM Mets: Juan Uribe pinch hit and left the game after aggravating a chest injury suffered last Sunday. X-rays were negative. Reds: Manager Bryan Price plans to use RHP Michael Lorenzen for one-inning appearances out of the bullpen the rest of the way to limit his pitches. The rookie has made 21 starts and thrown 109 2-3 innings. UP NEXT: Mets: RHP Matt Harvey (12-7) can clinch the title for New York. He's 1-0 with a 2.25 ERA in three career appearances against the Reds. He won his only start at Great American Ball Park in 2012. Reds: LHP John Lamb (1-3) has never faced the Mets. Lamb, acquired from the Royals in the trade for Johnny Cueto, is 1-0 with a 1.80 ERA in his last three starts.

Elsewhere, Seattle's stars Obafemi Martins and Clint Dempsey both scored to give the Sounders a 2-1 home win against Toronto, moving into a share of third place in the tightly contested Western Conference.

The Sounders moved level on points with Dallas, which is away at Columbus on Sunday, and a point ahead of two other teams in the fierce struggle for playoff positions.

In the day's other games, New England pulled away to beat Orlando City and Philadelphia won at San Jose.

Drogba's hat trick included the equalizing and go-ahead goals in quick succession midway through the second half.

The former Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker put Montreal ahead in the 27th minute on a goal set up by Nigel Reo-Coker's cross.

A flurry of three goals in eight minutes left the teams locked 2-2 at halftime. Chicago's Jeff Larentowicz converted a penalty in the 36th minute to level the scores, Wandrille Lefevre put Montreal ahead by heading in a corner in the 42nd, and Gilberto scored against his former club in the 44th to bring the Fire level again.

Kennedy Igboananike scored in the 59th minute to put Chicago in front for the first time, but it was Drogba who lifted Montreal to victory in the Impact's first game under interim coach Mauro Biello following Frank Klopas' firing.

Drogba drilled home the equalizer with a shot from near the edge of the area. In the 65th, his volley was saved by the goalkeeper but it was the former Chelsea striker who reacted quickest as he ran in to head the ball over the line with the keeper still grounded from the initial save. That completed a perfect hat trick: right foot, left foot and header.

Seattle's Martins and Dempsey played together in an MLS game for the first time since May 31 and showed they remain one the more dynamic duos in the league. The pair instigated both goals, Dempsey feeding Martins for the first goal in the opening minutes and Dempsey pouncing on a loose ball at the end of Martins long run to put Seattle in front in the 77th minute.

Eriq Zavaleta scored in the 59th minute for Toronto, but the Canadian club's attack struggled to create consistent pressure with Sebastian Giovinco out with an adductor injury and Jozy Altidore playing for the U.S. on international duty.

New England's Diego Fagundez scored late in the first half and the Revolution scored twice in the closing minutes to record a 3-0 home win against Orlando City.

New England (11-9-7) extended its undefeated streak to six, with five victories during that stretch.

The Revolution had a number of chances throughout the first half, and Fagundez finally capitalized in the 43rd minute with a two-touch finish of Lee Nguyen's chip cross.

Juan Agudelo tapped in the end of a four-pass combination to double New England's lead in the 84th minute, and Chris Tierney capped the scoring with a left-footed blast in the final minute.

Orlando City is winless in six matches.

Philadelphia's Conor Casey scored two late headed goals to lift the Union to a 2-1 win at San Jose.

Casey entered as a substitute in the 60th minute and scored the equalizer in the 74th, finishing Raymon Gaddis' diagonal cross with a leaping header. The goal snapped San Jose's 447-minute streak without conceding a goal; the longest in MLS this season.

The Union took the lead in the 86th minute when Casey redirected Tranquillo Barnetta's free kick with a glancing header.

Despite what our Facebook feeds might make it seem, life isn't all delicious food, European jaunts and beautiful people exercising in the sun.

Which is why Facebook is now, after years of speculation and requests, working on options besides the ""like"" button for users to weigh in on their friends' postings - including a potential ""dislike"" button.

During a public Q&A session on Tuesday, the company's co-founder and chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would soon start testing alternatives to the ""like button"". 

""People have asked about the dislike button for many years,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We've finally heard you and we're working on this and we will deliver something that meets the needs of the larger community."" 

The ""like"" feature was originally conceived in 2007 as an ""awesome"" button, before rolling out to users in 2009 as ""an easy way to tell friends that you like what they're sharing on Facebook with one easy click"". 

Facebook has been hesitant on rolling out a ""dislike button"", because negativity or a system where users can up-vote or down-vote in the style of Reddit ""isn't what we're here to build in the world"". 

""That doesn't seem like the kind of community that we want to create: You don't want to go through the process of sharing some moment that was important to you in your day and have someone 'down-vote' it,"" Mr Zuckerberg said during the town-hall session at Facebook's headquarters which was streamed online. 

Yet, using the example of the migrant crisis in Syria or a family member dying, Mr Zuckerberg highlighted that users might not always want to ""like"" something and would instead prefer to express empathy. 

""What they really want is an ability to express empathy,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""If you're expressing something sad… it may not feel comfortable to 'like' that post, but your friends and people want to be able to express that they understand."" 

It is not entirely clear whether the new button will actually be a ""dislike"" button or another emotion. 

Zuckerberg said creating the new interaction is ""surprisingly complicated"" but testing was expected to begin soon before a wider roll out.

""We've been working on this for a while,"" he said. 

The New York Times reported that a Facebook spokeswoman had declined to provide further details. 

The Like button and its thumbs-up icon have become a universal symbol for Facebook itself, helping the company's 1.49 billion users acknowledge friends' milestones or express their affinity for a brand or cause.

514677,094b6281-4b34-41a4-92c5-4824dec762c2,Get Creative with Sorghum this Fall,Troy Montgomery Herald,"( Family Features ) Leaves will soon begin to change into their golden vibrant hues. The aroma of cinnamon, crops being harvested and bonfires will dance in the wind as the autumn breeze begins to cool the air. Fall is right around the corner, and it’s time to start thinking about how to decorate for the upcoming season.  
  
Fall floral arrangements are a great way to add splashes of autumn colors to your home, Halloween parties, Thanksgiving gatherings, fall weddings and much more. To spice up your typical arrangements or to try something new, consider adding grain sorghum to achieve the look you desire this year.  
 
A grain crop grown here in the United States, sorghum is typically grown within the traditional Sorghum Belt, spanning from South Dakota to the Texas coast. Sorghum is traditionally used in a variety of ways, including livestock feed and ethanol production, and more recently it is gaining popularity as a versatile, American-grown ancient grain for the food industry. 
  
However, many people are discovering creative ways to utilize sorghum in their home. What makes sorghum a perfect addition to your fall decorative masterpieces is the versatility it has to offer.  
 
Visually pleasing to the eye, sorghum heads are comprised of hundreds of small berries attached to a stalk, which sits approximately four feet tall in the field. Sorghum has a unique color palette spanning from tans, bronzes and whites to browns, all of which are well-suited for your fall beautification projects.  
 
Embodying an earthy feel, sorghum is nurtured by farmers’ fields across the nation utilizing less water and resources. Not only is sorghum easy to use and incorporate, but it also offers the nostalgia of bringing the autumn harvest into your home. 
 
Sorghum heads can be trimmed to a variety of lengths, making them adaptable for use in an array of arrangements. Pull sprigs of the sorghum berries off of the sorghum head, attach floral wire and colorful sorghum berries can be incorporated in any way imaginable. 
 
Sorghum is the perfect addition to complement your favorite fall assortment of fresh-cut flowers. Combine sorghum with bright yellow sunflowers, deep orange and red centrifolia roses, and a touch of baby’s breath, and you’ll have an attention-getting arrangement. 
 
Perhaps you’d rather have a decoration to enjoy for years to come. Sorghum can also be dried and incorporated into a silk or dried floral arrangement. Pair dried grain sorghum stalks with colorful silk leaves, mini pumpkins or gourds, and other fall favorites for an eye-catching entryway decoration or table centerpiece.   
 
Sorghum’s colorful chroma doesn’t stop with fall, though. Sorghum can add versatility all year long. Spray paint dried sorghum with the color of your choice and add it into any floral arrangement, wreath and more for any season, or simply place several sorghum stalks in a vintage vase for a rustic arrangement all year long.

863163,af47301b-0bf7-4ce9-971b-a4d1dd6b14f4,Lanny Davis: Making news: The media-wide anti-Clinton bias,The Hill,"I have written before about the media’s anti-Clinton and pro-Sanders bias in reporting poll results in the Democratic presidential nomination contest. If you need any further evidence, take a look at the disparate media treatment when, in the last several days, Hillary Clinton’s poll results have been more positive, both nationally and in the early caucus and primary states.  

When CNN/ORC reported in its Sept. 10 survey that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was polling within 10 points of Clinton nationally among Democrats — 27 percent to Clinton’s 37 percent — those results were major stories in most of the mainstream media and breathlessly repeated on the cable morning, afternoon and evening shows. 

Then on Sept. 21, less than two weeks later, CNN/ORC reported that Clinton’s lead had nearly doubled — the former secretary of State now had an 18-point lead, with 42 percent to Sanders’s 24 percent.  

Is anyone surprised that the Sept. 21 results received far less coverage than the Sept. 10 results?   

This week, one of the most anti-Clinton cable daily morning shows ignored this CNN/ORC Poll while citing another, in which Clinton was in the lead by just 8 points. One panelist said perception of her email issue is “devouring her candidacy.” (Devouring???) 

And what about Iowa? Remember when The Des Moines Register at the end of August reported that Sanders had moved to within 7 points of Clinton there, 37 percent to 30 percent? This was a leading national news story, used over and over again as evidence of the Sanders “surge” and Clinton’s troubles. Then came the Quinnipiac University Poll released on Sept. 10 that reported a statistical dead heat in the state, with Clinton at 40 percent and Sanders at 41 percent.  

Yet on Sept. 22, the respected Public Policy Polling (PPP) organization reported Clinton ahead among Democrats in Iowa by 21 points (43 percent to 22 percent), based on a relatively large sample of 494 registered Democrats (with a margin of error of plus/minus 4.4 percent). Vice President Biden, who still has yet to announce whether he’ll make a bid in 2016, remained in third place, at 17 percent. He trails Clinton by 26 points, and Sanders by 5. 

In New Hampshire, a WMUR/CNN poll completed on July 30 garnered substantial media coverage when it showed that Sanders now held the lead there over Clinton, 42 percent to 36 percent. The NBC/Marist Poll for September showed the Vermont senator ahead by 9 points, 41 percent to 32 percent. Media coverage of Sanders “surging” and Clinton sagging was amplified even more.  

Yet a more recent Sept. 15 poll conducted by Boston’s WBUR showed Clinton making relative progress: She and Sanders were now back to a statistical dead heat, 35 percent to 31 percent (i.e., within the margin of error).  

In South Carolina, the former first lady remains substantially ahead of both Sanders and Biden, leading 34 points over Sanders in the RealClearPolitics polling average, with Biden in second place, 27 points behind Clinton.  

In Florida, the most recent PPP poll, completed Sept. 13, shows Clinton increasing her lead, with 55 percent to 18 percent and 17 percent, respectively, over Sanders and Biden.  

CNN’s Sept. 21 poll also shows Clinton with healthy leads nationally among Democratic women, older voters — who tend to turn out in higher percentages than younger voters — and, significantly, among nonwhite Democrats. Again, virtual silence in the media. 

So, you have read all the data, cited above, regarding the most recent polls. Here’s my request about what you just read: Ignore it.  

All polling data at this stage means little or nothing when it comes to predicting 2016. Polls are snapshots of a moving picture. The margins of error often can make conclusions dangerous as to who is actually ahead or behind. And primaries and caucuses that have low turnouts can distort most polls as a predictor of anything, especially so many months before the election. 

So what is my point? 

It’s quite simple: The media’s bias toward emphasizing polling data that appears to be bad news for Clinton and good news for Sanders is so clear, so obvious, that it is both undeniable and, one would think, embarrassing to legitimate news organizations.  

Why are they not embarrassed?

Brian Jeeves reporting from Victoria Road 

Teenage prodigy Jodi Jones earned Dagenham & Redbridge a valuable point with a stunning second half equaliser against Notts County at Victoria Road. 

These are desperate times for the Daggers. The Victoria Road outfit had failed to win any of their four home league fixtures to date and remained hovering one place above the drop zone on goal difference. 

Manager Wayne Burnett used his programme notes to emphasised the importance to start winning on their own patch and also expressed the need for the Dagenham fans to get behind his struggling charges. 

The Daggers boss made five changes to the side that slumped to defeat at Barnet, with wonderkid Jodi Jones returning to the starting line-up and perhaps surprisingly Jamie Cureton dropping to the bench. 

In form County arrived in east London off the back of a 1-0 victory over York City at Meadow Lane. Indeed, with three wins from their last four outings the Magpie’s had hauled themselves within a point of the play-off places. And its was an experienced line-up named by the east Midlanders manager Ricardo Moniz, including former Manchester United pair, goalkeeper Roy Carroll and midfielder Alan Smith. 

With the Daggers struggling for confidence, perhaps unsurprisingly it was the visitors who started the brighter in what was otherwise an insipide opening period. And with clear cut chances for either side coming at a premium, there was very little for the sparse crowd to get excited about. Indeed, it was more than half an hour before the fans witnessed a viable attempt. County’s Graham Burke sending a whistling effort just over the top. But within two minutes frontman Adam Campbell burst in from the left before plating low beyond advancing Daggers keeper Liam O’Brien to give the visitors the lead. 

Dagenham were offering very little resistance as County took control of proceedings Graham Burke’s troublesome centre was turned away by O’Brien while, Izale McLeod fizzed over from distance. The home side left the field at half time to a chorus of booing from the frustrated Victoria Road faithful. 

After the interval Daggers finally displayed some kind of threat. County’s Northern Irish International keeper Carroll smothered expertly after Jones had displayed trickery and delivered from the right. Soon after Ashley Hemmings’ thundering strike was narrowly off target, this after his initial attempt had been blocked. But Dagenham seemed to be making very little headway as the resolute County rearguard nullified what little the home side had to offer. In fact County almost extended their lead when Campbell’s volley was beaten away by O’Brien. 

But with just under twenty minutes remaining the tenacious Jones brilliantly levelled the contest, sending a curling left foot drive past the extended Carroll and high into the net, bringing the home fans to life in the process.   

Daggers had the bit between their teeth. Substitute Ashley Chambers was desperately unlucky when his strike came back off the face of the bar. But seconds later it seemed as if disaster had struck the hosts. Ayo Obileye was clumsy on Jack Barmby inside the box, but O’Brien brilliantly turned aside McLeod’s resulting spot-kick low to his right. 

Daggers introduced Cureton and Zavon Hines in a bid to snatch a vital three points, the latter sending an effort the wrong side of an upright. In response, County’s Jonathan Stead turned on the proverbial sixpence, but could only look on as his thundering attempt cannoned back off a post. 

Despite picking up a point, Daggers slipped back into the drop zone after Crawley Town won at bottom of the table Newport County. Nevertheless, manager Wayne Burnett was reasonably satisfied with his team’s second half performance, stating: “We needed to put in a performance after Saturday which wasn’t very good. First half we didn’t really perform, second half we were much, much better.  Let’s make no mistake, they’ve got some good players. They’re going to be in the top seven without a doubt. Their Manager has assembled some really good players, they paid £100,000 for their centre forward, they’ve got two players who played in the Premier League. Let’s be honest about it, for my players to come back and get a result tonight was fantastic. 

Daggers will look to build on this result when Mansfield Town visit Victoria Road oon Saturday October 3, kick-off 3pm.

 Drama/Romance/Action. Tom Hardy, Emily Browning, Taron Egerton, Christopher Eccleston, Paul Anderson, David Thewlis, Colin Morgan, Tara Fitzgerald, Paul Bettany, Chazz Palminteri. Director: Brian Helgeland. Released: September 9 (UK & Ireland)  
 
Tom Hardy portrays both Ronnie and Reggie Kray in Brian Helgeland's brutal portrait of the notorious gangsters. 
 
One helping of the London-born leading man, with his imposing physical presence and willingness to delve into the darkest recesses of the human psyche, is usually an emotionally bruising treat. A double dose of Hardy should be an overflowing feast for the senses. 
 
Surprisingly, the neat gimmick of casting the same actor in dual roles proves an almighty distraction. 
 
 
 
Using the visual shorthand of a pair of spectacles to distinguish between the two Krays, Hardy plays Ronnie as a blackly humorous psychopath, who seems to be one giggle shy of Jack Nicholson's Joker. Reggie, as a dutiful son, always puts family ties ahead of personal desires. 
 
""My loyalty to my brother is how I measure myself,"" he confides. 
 
Helgeland's period drama is torn between these two very different faces of the same blood-spattered coin. 
   Promoted stories   
 
 
Ultimately, the film comes apart at the seams as it lurches between tenderness and lurid violence to lay bare the unshakeable bond between the brothers. 
 
Reggie and identical twin Ronnie own a lucrative club in London, where the rich and famous rub shoulders with bad boys and criminals. 
 
With guidance from business manager Leslie Payne (David Thewlis), the club goes from strength to strength and the brothers entertain a transatlantic union with organised crime boss Meyer Lansky. 
 
 
 
""London is going to be the Las Vegas of Europe,"" grins Lansky's associate Angelo Bruno (Chazz Palminteri). 
 
On the mean streets of the capital, the Krays continue a brutal turf war with Charlie Richardson (Paul Bettany) and remain one step ahead of Detective Superintendent Leonard 'Nipper' Read (Christopher Eccleston). 
 
Reggie embarks on a giddy romance with 16-year-old Frances Shea (Emily Browning), sister of his driver Frankie (Colin Morgan), despite vociferous protests from her mother (Tara Fitzgerald). 
 
 
 
The relationship coincides with Ronnie's turbulent affair with Edward Smith (Taron Egerton). 
 
Sibling rivalry intensifies and Reggie struggles to contain his brother's sadistic impulses and keep Frances on an even keel. 
 
Based on the book The Profession of Violence by John Pearson, Legend captures the fashions and sounds of Fifties and Sixties London with aplomb, but the abrupt shifts in pace and tone are deeply discomfiting. 
 
 
 
Individually, Hardy's portrayals of Ronnie and Reggie are fascinating but placed side by side, they induce a cinematic headache. 
 
Supporting cast are similarly torn between understated (Browning) and exaggerated (Egerton), including a colourful turn from John Sessions as a slippery conservative peer, who enjoys the company of young men.

The running time drags in places but it's hard to tear your eyes from the screen, even when Helgeland's film seems to be careering wildly out of control.

Reggie embarks on a giddy romance with 16-year-old Frances Shea (Emily Browning), sister of his driver Frankie (Colin Morgan), despite vociferous protests from her mother (Tara Fitzgerald). The relationship coincides with Ronnie's turbulent affair with Edward Smith (Taron Egerton). Sibling rivalry intensifies and Reggie struggles to contain his brother's sadistic impulses and keep Frances on an even keel. Based on the book The Profession of Violence by John Pearson, Legend captures the fashions and sounds of Fifties and Sixties London with aplomb, but the abrupt shifts in pace and tone are deeply discomfiting. Individually, Hardy's portrayals of Ronnie and Reggie are fascinating but placed side by side, they induce a cinematic headache. Supporting cast are similarly torn between understated (Browning) and exaggerated (Egerton), including a colourful turn from John Sessions as a slippery conservative peer, who enjoys the company of young men. Share article The running time drags in places but it's hard to tear your eyes from the screen, even when Helgeland's film seems to be careering wildly out of control.

A double dose of Hardy should be an overflowing feast for the senses. Surprisingly, the neat gimmick of casting two men with undeniable vocal similarities, but very different physical appearances but as fraternal duo adds another dimension to the director’s alluring lunge into the 1960s London gangland. A dark contrast, too, with what is happening on the British stage and the lighter side of the spy genre, suggested by the British take on Aquaman.

There are numerous aspects that contribute heavily towards these fractured creations standing out amongst their peers; first there was something about me wanting them but never needling until recently which changed my views slightly regarding acting jobs available especially if you happen perform some roles simultaneously even though still finding other things may suit better personally speaking thus feeling motivated afterwards due mainly being able get through all steps easily without stopping mid point just because can feel bored after few hours before taking another break hence creating much needed momentum again...for anyone trying hard come across best possible results regardless how difficult might seem

While the government has issued notifications for merger of commodities markets regulator FMC with capital markets watchdog Sebi with effect from September 28, the revised norms for exchanges and various market participants were notified last month to pave way for the combined regulatory regime.

There were expectations that the merger would pave way for the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to participate in the commodities derivatives market, as they are already allowed by Sebi in the capital markets segment under its ambit.

Sources said Sebi had written to the Reserve Bank and the government in this regard, and RBI has replied that the status quo should be maintained till a policy review is undertaken by the government for allowing FPIs in the commodities derivative trading.

Ahead of FMC merger with itself, Sebi has also amended its norms that would allow functioning of the commodities derivatives market and its brokers under the ambit of the capital market regulator.

The amended regulations include those related to stock exchanges and clearing corporations. These new norms will also come into force on September 28, the date from which Sebi will begin regulating the commodity derivatives market as a unified regulator.

Among others, a regional commodity derivatives exchange should pay to Sebi an annual regulatory fee of Rs 50,000 within 30 days of conclusion of the relevant financial year, according to the amended norms.

In the case of national commodity derivatives exchanges, the net worth for a self clearing member should be Rs 1 crore and for a clearing member, the same should be Rs 3 crore.

The deposit amount in the case of national commodity derivative exchange would be Rs 50 lakh for both self-clearing and clearing members.

With regard to regional commodity derivatives exchanges, the net worth level and deposit amount for self-clearing and clearing members would be specified by Sebi from time to time.

786947,73ec5830-6fff-435e-a155-f0a2512767e4,Experts: No criminal exposure for Clinton,Daily Hampshire Gazette,"WASHINGTON — Experts in government secrecy law see almost no possibility of criminal action against Hillary Clinton or her top aides in connection with now-classified information sent over unsecure email while she was secretary of state, based on the public evidence thus far. 
 
Some Republicans, including leading GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, have called Clinton’s actions criminal and compared her situation to that of David Petraeus, the former CIA director who was prosecuted after giving top secret information to his paramour. Others have cited the case of another past CIA chief, John Deutch, who took highly classified material home. 
 
But in both of those cases, no one disputed that the information was highly classified and in many cases top secret. Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor; Deutch was pardoned by President Bill Clinton. 
 
By contrast, there is no evidence of emails stored in Hillary Clinton’s private server bearing classified markings. State Department officials say they don’t believe that emails she sent or received included material classified at the time. And even if other government officials dispute that assertion, it is extremely difficult to prove anyone knowingly mishandled secrets. 
 
“How can you be on notice if there are no markings?” said Leslie McAdoo, a lawyer who handles security-clearance cases. 
 
Clinton’s critics have focused on the unusual, home-brew email server Clinton used while in office and suggested that she should have known that secrets were improperly coursing through an unsecure system, leaving them easily hackable for foreign intelligence agencies. But to prove a crime, the government would have to demonstrate that Clinton or aides knew they were mishandling the information — not that she should have known. 
 
A case would be possible if material emerges that is so sensitive Clinton must have known it was highly classified, whether marked or not, McAdoo said. But no such email has surfaced. And among the thousands of documents made public, nothing appears near the magnitude of the Top Secret material Petraeus and Deutch mishandled. 
 
Trump, last week, argued differently, saying Petraeus’ case involved “far less important documents.” Clinton’s documents, he told Fox News, “were more highly secret, they were more important, there were more of them. It’s really General Petraeus on steroids.” 
 
Petraeus, a married former four-star general who headed the CIA from 2011-2012, admitted he gave his biographer and lover, Paula Broadwell, journals containing Top Secret information. These included “the identifies of covert officers, war strategy, intelligence capabilities and mechanisms, diplomatic discussions, quotes and deliberative discussions from high-level National Security Council meetings . and discussions with the president of the United States,” according to court documents. 
 
Petraeus also admitted lying to the FBI, while his emails showed he knew the journals contained highly classified information. 
 
He pleaded guilty to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, a misdemeanor. Though eligible for up to one year in prison, he was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $100,000 fine. Broadwell didn’t publish the material. 
 
Deutch ran the agency from 1995-1996. He took Top Secret information home and stored it on computers connected to the Internet, something he also did when he worked at the Pentagon. In January 2001, he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling government secrets, but Bill Clinton pardoned him before the Justice Department could file the case. 
 
Another Clinton administration official, Samuel “Sandy” Berger, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in 2005 after admitting to removing five classified documents involving a terrorism study from a National Archives facility. Berger served four years as Clinton’s national security adviser. 
 
Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, now says her use of home email server for government business was a mistake. Last year she provided about 30,000 emails to the State Department, which is public releasing another batch Monday. The department is only publishing documents after scrubbing them of any classified or sensitive information. 
 
Two government inspectors have told Congress they found material in the emails was secret at the time it was sent to Clinton and “never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.” 
 
The State Department and the Clinton campaign dispute that the material was classified at the time. 
 
At least one email involved the CIA drone strikes, government officials have told the Associated Press. The counterterrorism program is a poorly kept secret, but a secret nonetheless. Another email appeared to reference a highly classified matter, the officials said, though there was some question about whether the information came in through classified or open channels. 
 
Emails posted on the State Department’s web site, made public under the Freedom of Information Act, show diplomats commonly slipping and discussing classified information over email. Unlike an intelligence agency, the department seeks to operate in the open when it can. 
 
But arguing that violations are common isn’t a valid defense for ordinary government employees, said Bradley Moss, a lawyer who often represents such people. They face discipline “all the time, in far more nuanced disputes than this,” he said. 
 
Although political controversy has centered on Clinton’s use of private email instead of an unsecured government account, the distinction matters little in the context of classified information. Clinton says State Department rules allowed her to use private email and officials knew about it. 
 
But another law could be relevant. Under the Federal Records Act, destroying official records can be a crime. Clinton ordered around 32,000 emails deleted from her server because she said they were personal. The server was then wiped, making the emails unretrievable. 
 
“If one person has a copy of one of those deleted emails, and it was about government business, the whole game changes,” said Kel McClanahan, a lawyer and expert in government records.

BlueTalon hopes to tackle that problem with what it calls the first-ever filtering and dynamic masking capabilities for use directly on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 
 
Though Hadoop has enjoyed widespread popularity for big data purposes, the technology's core didn’t originally contain any security controls, said Nik Rouda, a senior analyst with ESG Research.

Twitter is already gearing up for next year's U.S. presidential elections and it just introduced a new way for users to make campaign donations through tweets. 
 
At the same time, candidates can also solicit donations through a tweet, prompting users to support their cause. Twitter teamed up with Square for the initiative and candidates will have to sign up for a Square Cash account to take advantage of the new Twitter feature. 
 
Once Square verifies the campaign, the candidate or representative who is the Twitter account holder can tweet a link or ""$Cashtag"" to solicit donations. The tweet will also include an image with a ""contribute"" button. 
 
Other Twitter users, meanwhile, can click on that ""contribute"" button and send money through a simple tweet. Twitter will enable users to select a cash amount they want to donate and add their debit card, as well as FEC required details. Once they make the donation, Twitter users can also tweet the candidate's $Cashtag to encourage their followers to contribute as well. 
 
""This is the fastest, easiest way to make an online donation, and the most effective way for campaigns to execute tailored digital fundraising, in real time, on the platform where Americans are already talking about the 2016 election and the issues they are passionate about,"" Twitter explains  in a new press release on Tuesday, Sept. 15. 
 
Twitter further notes that it developed several tools such as country-specific notifications to remind users when to register to vote, richer tweets that facilitate email collection during campaigns, and real-time audience tailoring for advertisers. 
 
Twitter has always been a popular tool for discussing political issues, supporting causes and raising awareness in various situations. The latest move will enable the microblogging company now to play a bigger role in politics. 
 
Twitter made no mention yet of whether it plans to extend this simple campaign donation service to other markets as well in the future, but for now it, has the 2016 U.S. presidential elections in mind. Currently, only Twitter users and candidates in the U.S. can take advantage of this new service developed in collaboration with Square.

By Caroline Valetkevitch 

Sept 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended down slightly on
Wednesday, led by losses in materials and energy shares as weak
Chinese and U.S. factory data added to growth worries. 

Trading was choppy once gain, with the S&P 500 briefly
trading higher following afternoon comments by Chinese President
Xi Jinping that his country was capable of maintaining a
relatively high growth rate for a long time. 
 
The S&P 500 is down 2.8 percent since Thursday, when the
Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates near zero. 

Data showed U.S. manufacturing growth stayed at a two-year
low in September, while Chinese factory activity shrank to a
6-1/2 year low in the month, underscoring worries about demand. 

Boeing Co said it had won orders and commitments
from China for aircraft valued at about $38 billion at list
prices. But its shares fell 1.7 percent to $131.67. 

The S&P materials index, down 2.1 percent, led the
decline for the S&P 500 for a second day, followed by the energy
index, which was down 1.4 percent. 
 
U.S. crude oil futures ended down 4.1 percent, while shares
of Chevron were down 1.5 percent at $76.12. 

""The market looks tired and flat, and there is some
hesitation to commit with earnings coming out in two weeks and
worries about China and the impact on companies that do a lot of
business overseas,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager
at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. 

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 50.58 points,
or 0.31 percent, to 16,279.89, the S&P 500 lost 3.98
points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,938.76 and the Nasdaq Composite
 dropped 3.98 points, or 0.08 percent, to 4,752.74. 
 
Worries over a China-led global economic slowdown and
uncertainty over when the Fed may raise rates have left
investors skittish. 

S&P 500 earnings are projected to decline 3.9 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. 

Volume was light due to the Yom Kippur holiday. About 5.9
billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the
roughly 8 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days,
according to Thomson Reuters data. 

First Niagara Financial was up 14.5 percent at

Nasdaq, 1,609 issues fell and 1,185 advanced for a 1.36-to-1

It’s pretty sweet, and it’s an improvement over any of their more recent court designs. Their most recent design was ranked 29th out of 30 in the home-court rankings Zach Lowe did for Grantland last year, and justifiably so. This one is better. 
       
The Timberwolves have announced two more additions to their training-camp roster: undrafted center Kleon Penn and, more notably, Nick Wiggins , the older brother of Andrew: 
 
The Minnesota Timberwolves today announced the team has signed center Kleon Penn and guard Nick Wiggins. 
 
Penn, 29, most recently played in 45 games with Vaqueros de Bayamon in Puerto Rico, averaging 4.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 18.4 minutes per game. Penn, a Virgin Islands native, recently won a gold medal in June with the Virgin Islands during the Caribbean Basketball Confederation Championships, a team that interim head coach Sam Mitchell led. Penn finished his college career at McNeese State in 2009. 
 
Wiggins, 24, appeared in three games for the Timberwolves 2015 NBA Las Vegas Summer League entry, averaging 4.0 points in 11.0 minutes per game. Wiggins, 6-6, spent parts of last season with the Idaho Stampede in the NBA D-League, averaging 9.8 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. Wiggins, the older brother of Andrew Wiggins , started the year in Germany playing with the Tigers Tubingen. Wiggins played two seasons at Wichita State University and went undrafted in the 2014 NBA Draft. 
 
It’s nice that he’s getting a camp invite, but the Timberwolves’ roster is pretty full at this point, so it’s unlikely he gets a spot. He will probably start the year in the D-League. 
       
PBT is previewing the 2015-16 NBA season by tackling 51 big questions that we can’t wait to see answered once play tips off. We will answer one a day right up to the start of the season Oct. 27. Today’s question: 
 
Can DeMarcus Cousins , Rajon Rondo , and George Karl get along well enough to lead Sacramento back to the playoffs? 
 
The last time the Sacramento Kings took part in a playoff game, you were walking around singing “So Sick” from Ne-Yo and were meeting your friends to see “ Phat Girlz ” at the theater. Well, maybe not because nobody really went and saw Phat Girlz at the theater. But you get the idea, it’s been a while. Nine seasons to be specific. 
 
On paper, the Kings have the talent to keep that from becoming 10. DeMarcus Cousins is the best traditional center in the game today, he’s a beast who averaged 24.1 points and 12.7 rebounds a game last season. Rudy Gay is a 20 point a game wing player. Rajon Rondo is a former All-Star point guard who even last season led the league in assist chances per game — he can still dish the rock. There are quality rotation players such as Marco Belinelli , Darren Collison , Kosta Koufos , Caron Butler , and Omri Casspi , plus an intriguing rookie in Willie Cauley-Stein . All coached by one of the winningest coaches in NBA history, George Karl. 
 
Or, the entire thing could blow up. 
 
There seems to be no middle ground with the Kings this season — either they are a playoff team (or close to it, the West is deep), or things get ugly fast. 
 
It all comes down to one simple question: Can some headstrong players and a stubborn coach all get along? 
 
Kings players were bonding all summer (Cousins even went to Israel with Casspi), and a lot of that was done without Karl around. Sources around the Kings think the players have started to bond, in part over their dislike of Karl — and that could bring them together and make it all work. 
 
There’s the other simple fact of NBA life: Winning solves a lot of chemistry problems. If the Kings can get there. 
 
Cousins has been understandably frustrated with ownership’s constant changing of directions in recent years. Last season he formed a great bond with coach Mike Malone, who had changed the culture in that team’s locker room. Then Malone was fired mid-season, reportedly because owner Vivek Ranadive wanted to run more. They got Karl to put in that up-tempo system. 
 
Karl and Cousins have already had a feud because Karl reportedly pushed to trade Cousins (something Ranadive and GM Vlade Divac oppose, so don’t expect it). Cousins responded on Twitter calling Karl a “snake in the grass.” Now the two have sat down and talked , but the underlying tension has not gone away. 
 
“All our guys are hungry for winning, but Cuz is our best player, most talented kid,” Karl told PBT this summer (before he met with Cousins). “We need him to feel like there’s a commitment from both sides. He to us and us to him.” 
 
Then there is a headstrong point guard in Rondo who likes to call his own plays — just ask Rick Carlisle — trying to mix with Karl, a coach who has feuded with more than one of his former stars. Add in the fact Rondo is on a one-year contract, so he could have an eye on his numbers, not just the win column. 
 
“He’s a very basketball high IQ guy,” Karl said of Rondo. “He’s going to challenge us as coaches because I think he knows the game and he’ll have some things; we’ll probably some give and take on. But this kid’s an All-Star, he’s a triple-double machine when he’s playing well. He likes to lead teams, he leads teams with a spirit that has some toughness to it. 
 
“He’s a pass-first point guard, which I think is important. In the end, he and Darren (Collison) really excite me. We’re going to have two guys who can take control of the team, play together, and keep the pace of the game where we can play with a lot of freedom and creativity, and also play without turnovers… 
 
“I think it’s going to be fun coaching (Rondo). I think he wants to lead our team, but he also wants to be a part of the decision making. That can be somewhat combustible, but that also can work at a high level.” 
 
Combustible is a good word for these Kings. 
 
These Kings could use that combustible fuel to jet higher up in the standings than anyone expects, or they could just explode. 
 
In recent years, Sacramento has not been the kind of stable environment you want for handling volatile compounds. It leads to doubts about how good this team will be; there’s a feeling that things could just be shaken up at any time. Or, maybe the Kings have started to figure it out — they have to prove that, but maybe.

The exhibition title alludes to the phenomenon known as the phantom limb syndrome, when an individual perceives sensation in a lost body part.

Phantom Bodies is organized thematically into four sections. ""Objects and Absences"" includes works by Christian Boltanski, Janet Cardiff 

The next section, ""Violence, Empathy, and Erasure,"" proposes that an artwork's aura is intensified when it is connected to crime, war, or social injustice. Haunting sculptures, videos, and photographs by artists in this section, including Magdalena Abakanowicz, Ken Gonzales-Day 

In the third section, ""Sublimation,"" Ross Bleckner 

The exhibition concludes with ""The Mind-Body Problem,"" featuring artworks by Barry X Ball, Damien Hirst

Two overs later Abell claimed his maiden first class century when he ran three to deep cover off Crane, his runs coming from 155 balls with 16 fours.

Tom Cooper then raced his way to 50 taking three consecutive fours and a single off an over from McLaren. 
 
The Australian then hit two huge sixes, the first off Dawson over long off and the second off Crane at the opposite end that landed in the new pavilion building site.

When you surrender your pet to any shelter, the transition can be difficult. Even the most modern shelter can be a stressful environment for a pet used to living in a home. 
  
Take your pet to a veterinarian for a checkup and make sure your pet is up to date on all of its vaccines. Be sure your pet is spayed or neutered. This can assist in placing your pet in another home or rescue quicker. 
  
Call your local animal shelter as soon as you know you cannot take your animal with you. There may be a waiting list, so dropping your pet off on the day of your move may not work. The shelter staff can assist you with resources and ideas beyond what we can list here. 
  
Get photos of your pet on your social media sites and ask everyone you know to share them. Talk with your friends and relatives to see if they would be able to commit to taking your animal into their homes. If you have to surrender your pet to the shelter, please be prepared with the following paperwork: A valid ID and veterinary or license records that show you are the owner of the animal. 
 
 
  
We will ask you to fill out a ""personality profile"" about your pet. Please be honest when answering these questions; information about its health, behavior, habits, likes and dislikes is really helpful to people considering your pet for adoption and helps us decide what kind of home would be best for it.

Talk with your friends and relatives to see if they would be able to commit to taking your animal into their homes. If you have to surrender your pet to the shelter, please be prepared with the following paperwork: A valid ID and veterinary or license records that show you are the owner of the animal. We will ask you to fill out a ""personality profile"" about your pet. Please be honest when answering these questions; information about its health, behavior, habits, likes and dislikes is really helpful to people considering your pet for adoption and helps us decide what kind of home would be best for it. PET OF THE WEEK: BOOTS is a gorgeous seal point snowshoe cat. His family moved and was unable to take him. Dog Alley: There are 13 dogs available for adoption. GENTLE RED is a handsome fella that may be blind in one eye, but that doesn't stop him from being good with other dogs, great on a leash and making a great family pet. He is a 6-year-old red and white pit bull mix. OREO, a 2-year-old Alaskan husky, is a good boy that needs further leash training. Luckily for him and his adopters, the SASHA fund will pay for free dog training for all the dogs adopted from FAAS. Cat Lair: There are 31 cats available for adoption.

482713,b069f502-0cf3-405d-9908-1f8100d1544c,Theology: at the heart of mission,The Surprising God,"This post continues a series looking at The Shape of Practical Theology by Trinitarian theologian Ray S. Anderson. For other posts in the series, click on a number: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. 
Last time we noted how Dr. Anderson emphasizes that mission is at the heart of theology. This time, we'll see how he places theology at the heart of mission.
Jesus Healing Centurion Servant by Paolo Veronese Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons  According to Anderson, there are many ways people care for one another, and in so doing alleviate human suffering. While such efforts are laudable, they only constitute Christian ministry to the extent they reveal the reality of ""God's revelation and reconciliation through Jesus Christ"" (p. 54). Anderson comments:
A social worker or psychiatrist may be able ""make"" people better or to ""make"" the conditions of human existence better. But the end result tends to be just that---a result, a product from which the ""maker"" can detach himself or herself with no consequent loss of identity or meaning. However, in Christopraxis the act itself becomes the embodiment of a life of community and wholeness that is derived from God himself through Christ. Thus we know that reconciliation is more than making people or conditions better; it is inextricably involved with revealing the power and presence of God through the act. In the same way, we can also say that there are forms of ministry that purport to proclaim revealed truths of God and to indoctrinate disciples in those truths, but if they do not also touch broken and alienated human lives with liberating and healing power, they are not of God. (pp. 54-55) As Christian ministers, our calling and challenge is to ensure that our theology is missionally grounded and that our mission, through theological reflection, is theologically centered. Regarding the second part of that challenge, Anderson notes this:
Theological reflection is the activity of the Christian and the church by which acts of ministry are critically and continually assessed in light of both revelation and reconciliation as God' true Word... Theological reflection as a critical exercise leads to competence in ministry by which the one who ministers unites both proclamation and practice in the truth of Jesus Christ. It is not only reflection on the nature of ministry from the perspective of biblical and theological truths but also on the nature of divine revelation from the perspective of its saving and reconciling intention in the lives of people. (p. 55, emphasis added) Sadly, theological reflection often is shallow at best or altogether absent at worst---seen by many church leaders as unnecessary and even a distraction, with preachers proclaiming, ""Now I don't want to get too theological here."" Of course, if the theology they are referring to is ivory-tower stuff detached from the reality of Jesus and his ongoing missional activity, then their concern has merit. However, for them to proceed with teaching and leading their church in mission apart from thoughtful, ongoing theological reflection is to risk detaching their teaching and missional activity from the person and work of Jesus Christ.
By the way, the theological reflection that Anderson advocates is not about discovering ""new truth."" To the contrary, it's about ensuring that our missional activity is deeply grounded in the theological reality of the enduring apostolic tradition, the truth of the gospel which is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to us by the Spirit in Holy Scripture.
Theological reflection takes careful note of Scripture, leading us then to take careful note of ""the presence of the One who is revealed in his continuing ministry of reconciliation through the Holy Spirit (p. 55). Theological reflection does not ask, ""What would Jesus do in this situation,"" but ""Where is Jesus in this situation and what am I to do as a minister"" (p. 56).
Thus we understand that the principal theological competence of ministers is that of spiritual discernment---the ability to discern the presence and ongoing ministry of Jesus, in the Spirit. That discernment includes taking careful note of the historic activity of Jesus described in the New Testament so we can then discern his current missional activity, through the Spirit, in our world. So, again, the question is not ""What would Jesus do?"", but ""What is Jesus now doing, and how may we participate?""
This sort of Christ-centered, missionally grounded theological reflection avoids a common problem, namely the tendency toward separating the being and the doing of God, which means abstracting the truth of God from the work of God (p. 57). This abstraction can cause Christians to entirely miss the boat as to God's actual nature (being) and actual, ongoing work (doing) in the world. An example of this abstraction is the way the Jewish religious leaders in the first century turned Sabbath law into an abstract, absolute principle, and in so doing were able to justify condemning Jesus for his work of healing on the Sabbath. Jesus' response was to chastise them for holding a theology detached from God's activity.
Paul, who as Saul, had succumbed to this Pharisaic abstraction, learned, through the Spirit, a better way of knowing the triune God in his integrated being and doing as revealed fully and conclusively in the person and work of Jesus Christ. With his theology now centered in Christ, coupled with his ongoing missional grounding in the work of the Spirit, Paul proclaimed circumcision no longer a criteria of covenant membership.
Next time we'll look more at how ministry competency has to do with integrating theology and mission in Jesus.

Brought up by a heroin-addicted mother, and shuttled in and out of foster care during her stints in jail, he ended up dropping out of university and spiralling into a full-blown ice addiction. 

He now uses his awful upbringing in his comedic routine, to critical acclaim. He won the Best Newcomer Award at this year’s Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and received rave reviews for his Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut. 

But it’s his time in foster care that still haunts him. Here he has written a gruelling, honest account of that time, and why he thinks the system needs to change.

Be warned — it’s brutal.

***

My mum was a heroin addict. As bad as it was growing up in a Harmony Korine film, my time in foster care was far worse. In countless different foster homes I was starved, bashed, emotionally abused, raped by an older foster brother and taken on holiday to the Tamworth Country Music Festival.

Before my mother went to The-Great-Heroin-Dealer-In-The-Sky, child services kept returning me to her care despite repeated abuse and neglect. This is a household in which my sister was shaken as a baby, yet time and time again we were reunited with a woman whose spirit animal was the concept of neglect. Based on my experience, were Josef Fritzl Australian, child services would have given him his children/grandchildren back so long as he promised to convert the dungeon into a consensual sex basement.

Right now we’re midway through a Royal Commission into how good Australia is at child abuse, a kind of Melbourne Cup for institutional paedophilia and child neglect. With God on their side, the Catholic Church is the favourite, but the foster care system is a roughie that can’t be ignored.

Calling the foster care system broken is like saying Agent Orange is “a bit itchy.” A recent report revealed hundreds of foster children are being physically and sexually abused while in care. Others have concluded foster children have vastly increased risks of homelessness, mental illness, substance abuse, poor education outcomes, imprisonment and suicide.

There is no greater indictment of the foster care system when a news website’s go-to-option for an article on growing up in foster care is me, an overweight middling comedian with jokes about wanking and pies. Couldn’t get a doctor? An accountant? I tell jokes about drone strikes to barflies for free soft drink.

People have no idea foster care is this bad. Finding out the system supposed to protect children is rife with abuse is like discovering the RSPCA runs dogfighting rings or Beyonce is pro-female genital mutilation.

The blame lies with State Labor and Liberal Governments. For decades they’ve taken turns doing nothing, like actors in some shit Samuel Beckett play. In 2007, the Federal Government suspended the Racial Discrimination Act, sending soldiers to the Northern Territory when a report found systematic child abuse in remote communities. Way more children have been abused in the State foster care systems, so by the Federal Government’s logic they should send in tanks to the State Parliaments. But of course they won’t.

The foster care system is so underfunded it has less money than a charity helping parking inspectors swim with dolphins. It’s overburdened, at breaking point. Child services employ too few social workers, each one dealing with massive caseloads that mean they can neither properly support good foster carers or adequately monitor bad ones.

There’s a severe shortage of foster carers. It takes a special kind of person to even foster in the first place; these benevolent weirdos take in the children of strangers while we’re all praying that crying baby on the plane shuts up. But that tiny number gets whittled down by the poor pay and the minimal assistance from child services, twin blows exacerbated by the fact many foster children are extremely high-needs. It’s unsurprising many foster carers quit in bitter exhaustion. The result is foster children being moved from foster home to foster home, displaced, marginal, without a sense of belonging.

We also need to acknowledge some people aren’t parent material. There are roughly 20,000 Australian children in foster care and that number is growing. A guy I know, a big drunken drugging wreck, once told me that he hoped a baby would help him “grow up.” People actually think children are life coaches you get to name. “We shall call him Oliver, may fatherhood stop me vomiting over myself on Friday nights.” I think we should pay people to be given long-term contraception until they get their life together. Give them money, jet skis, a nice kettle.

We live in a time of enormous collective delusion. One in which we naively let anyone have children, then elect politicians who don’t protect the victims of that naivety. When the Royal Commission hands down recommendations for how our society can better protect children, I hope one of them is self-awareness.

546033,45e142ff-e7ba-417a-beb9-c56f215132f7,Pope Francis to nuns: 'I love you very much',WPBF,"Francis also again calls attention to the pain recent scandals in the Church have caused  
Pope Francis gave nuns a big shoutout at his first event during his first-ever trip to New York. 
 
""In a special way I would like to express my esteem and gratitude to the religious women of the United States. What would the Church be without you?"" he said, to huge applause, during evening prayers Thursday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 

""Women of strength, fighters, with that spirit of courage which puts you on the front lines in the proclamation of the Gospel. To you, religious women, sisters and mothers of this people, I wish to say 'thank you,' a big thank you... and to tell you that I love you very much."" 

The praise comes just months after the Vatican wrapped up an investigation of them. 

The Vatican accused the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the country's largest group of Catholic nuns, of sponsoring ""certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations. 

The Vatican report, made public by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group's dissent on the Holy See's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality. 

The Catholic Church ordains only men to be priests and says sex is to be between a man and woman who are married in the eyes of the church. 

Francis has previously said that women in the church are ""more important than bishops and priests."" In December of last year, he told a gathering of female theologians they were ""strawberries on the cake."" 

Francis has been working to elevate the role of women without changing doctrine. 

He has appointed women to a few powerful Vatican positions, including the committee to combat sex abuse in the Catholic Church, with roughly half of that 17-member committee made up of women. According to Vatican Radio, just 18% of the Vatican's workforce is female, including employees at Vatican museums, post offices and the Holy See that governs the Roman Catholic Church. 

In his homily, Francis also called attention to the pain recent scandals in the Church have caused. 

""You suffered greatly in the not distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the Church in the most vulnerable of her members,"" Francis said. 

His message was a pep talk to the audience, as he told them he is with them in this time of ""pain and difficulty"" and thankful for their faithful service. 

The Pope also acknowledged the challenges they face ""adapting to an evolving pastoral landscape."" 

Francis began the service by offering up prayers after the tragedy at Mecca. 

He expressed ""my sentiments of closeness in the face of the tragedy that they suffered."" 

A stampede during one of the last rituals of the Hajj season -- the annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca -- killed more than 700 people and injured close to 900 others in Saudi Arabia on Thursday. 

""In this moment I give them assurances of my prayers,"" Francis said. 

Francis' visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral marked the fifth pontifical trip to the site. More than five million people walk through the church's iconic bronze doors each year. 

Francis said the cathedral can serve as a ""symbol of the work of generations of American priests and religious, and lay faithful who helped build up the Church in the United States."" 

The cathedral, which opened in 1879, is the seat of the Archbishop. It has been through an extensive renovation estimated at $175 million. 

Francis' evening prayers capped a busy day. Thursday morning, he addressed Congress in a speech that focused on immigration, the death penalty, racial injustice, the weapons trade, and poverty. Friday, he'll address the United Nations.

The praise comes just months after the Vatican wrapped up an investigation of them. The Vatican accused the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, the country's largest group of Catholic nuns, of sponsoring ""certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations. The Vatican report, made public by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group's dissent on the Holy See's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality. The Catholic Church ordains only men to be priests and says sex is to be between a man and woman who are married in the eyes of the church. Francis has previously said that women in the church are ""more important than bishops and priests."" In December of last year, he told a gathering of female theologians they were ""strawberries on the cake."" Francis has been working to elevate the role of women without changing doctrine. He has appointed women to a few powerful Vatican positions, including the committee to combat sex abuse in the Catholic Church, with roughly half of that 17-member committee made up of women. According to Vatican Radio, just 18% of the Vatican's workforce is female, including employees at Vatican museums, post offices and the Holy See that governs the Roman Catholic Church. In his homily, Francis also called attention to the pain recent scandals in the Church have caused. ""You suffered greatly in the not distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the Church in the most vulnerable of her members,"" Francis said. His message was a pep talk to the audience, as he told them he is with them in this time of ""pain and difficulty"" and thankful for their faithful service. The Pope also acknowledged the challenges they face ""adapting to an evolving pastoral landscape."" Francis began the service by offering up prayers after the tragedy at Mecca.

807770,0269e5da-079d-4436-ac97-84a9cdb44b35,U.S. Open 2015: Andy Murray crashes out,16 WAPT,"Andy Murray will have to wait until next year for another crack at a grand slam. 
 
Suffering an ignominious defeat to South African Kevin Anderson in four sets, Murray looked frustrated and often powerless against the 15th seed who played out of his skin. 

Anderson took the game 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6. 

Murray, the World No. 3, complained to himself and the umpire repeatedly -- often in expletive-laden tirades caught on camera -- about everything from perceived game delays by Anderson to line calls. 

The truth is, it just wasn't his day. 

Going into the match, the 29-year-old Anderson was an unlikely candidate to dominate a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion. 

In his ninth year on the pro circuit, Anderson has had only three tour victories to his name and never advanced beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam. 

But the 6'8"" Johannesburg native was a force throughout the match, battling nerves only occasionally. He was broken early in the third set before losing it on a tiebreak, before coming back with an assured performance in the fourth set. 

Anderson played aggressively and took chances, pouring 25 aces past a sometimes helpless Murray, who was denied a 20th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal run. 

He hit 81 winners during the match against Murray's 49, and rushed the net 58 times versus 24 approaches for Murray. In fact, Anderson has been the most prolific net player in the entire U.S. Open, often displaying a graceful touch belying his giant frame. 

""I'm a little lost for words right now. I was just trying to keep my composure against Andy, and I honestly played one of the best matches of my life,"" said Anderson, who clinched the fourth set tiebreak to win. 

""He's such a fighter, and such an amazing player, I knew I had to try my best and just stick with it,"" he said. 

Federer raises game to down Isner 

World No. 2 Roger Federer faced No. 13 seed John Isner in the late match in Arthur Ashe Stadium, ultimately handling the big American's serve in three tight sets, winning the match 7-6, 7-6, 7-5. The Swiss player made his way to the quarterfinals for the 11th time with a vintage Federer performance, keeping alive his hopes of raising the trophy at Flushing Meadows for a sixth time. 

Federer kept his nerve throughout, not losing his serve to Isner once. For his part, Isner fought back gamely, only losing his serve once at the very end, and taking nine break points away from the winner. However, he was not able to match his 2011 U.S. Open-best quarterfinal result. 

Obviously John has one of the best serves in the game,"" Federer said after the win. ""You just gotta hang around and make sure you don't drop your serve."" 

The 34-year-old, 17-time Grand Slam men's singles champion has been on form throughout the summer, climbing back up the rankings to breathe down world number one Novak Djokovic. He's next set to play 12 seed Richard Gasquet in the quarterfinals. 

Missing shoes 

Temperatures soared once again on the hard courts of Flushing Meadow in a competitive, and sometimes quirky, eighth day of action at the U.S. Open. 

French Open champion Stan Wawrinka took four sets to cruise past American upstart Donald Young, in a match that saw a bizarre build-up. 

Young -- who had battled back from two sets down in his previous two matches at the Open -- had his locker mistakenly cleared out the day before the match, leaving him scrambling to find equipment until shortly before the match. 

""Unfortunately, I came to the locker room yesterday and I opened it up and it was clean,"" said Young, a former junior World No 1. ""Like a couple shirts missing, all my shoes were gone, and apparently someone said I was out of the tournament, so the guys thought I went home. They were taking some souvenirs."" 

Young showed some signs of life, taking the second set from Warwinka 6-1, before dropping the third and fourth sets. 

Warwinka will face Anderson in an intriguing quarterfinal matchup. 

Meanwhile, Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, who opened play in Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday, took just under one hour to knock out her fourth round opponent American Varvara Lepchenko, in straight sets. 

Severe heat 

Twentieth seed Azarenka will face Simona Halep, the No. 2 seed from Romania, in the quarterfinal. Halep defeated power-serving German Sabine Lisicki in a tense three-setter which saw a 10-minute heat break between the second and third sets. 

Halep was quick to point out that it was her opponent who called for a break, although she certainly didn't mind the breather. The temperature in New York -- which consistently topped 32˚C (90˚F) last week -- touched 33˚C (92˚F) on Monday. 

""I was fighting till the end. I did everything I could to win the match,"" said Halep, who, though visibly elated, added that she had a mixed doubles match scheduled for later in the day. ""I'm tired, I can say."" 

The first round of this year's U.S. Open witnessed a record 12 withdrawals, reigniting speculation that hard courts are more punishing on tennis players than clay and grass surfaces. 

A leading sports physicist claimed before Wimbledon that grass was significantly cooler than hard courts on a hot day, which -- along with less grip on the surface -- explained the relatively low number of Wimbledon withdrawals versus those in the U.S. Open and the Australian Open over the years. 

""On a hot day like 40˚C (104˚F), the temperature on the court itself can be 60˚C (140˚F). If you took your shoes off you'd actually burn the skin off your feet,"" said Professor Rod Cross from Sydney University. ""That's physically exhausting and I think it's crazy to have courts that are so hot."" 

Last week, American Jack Sock fainted on the court, leading to a forfeiture of his second round match. 

New Yorkers are expected to face more warm weather on Tuesday before temperatures cool off over the rest of the week. 

Serena slam 

Meanwhile, another Grand Slam chapter of the somewhat lacklustre head-to head series of Williams sisters battles is set to take place in a quarterfinal match on Tuesday. 

Serena Williams will face her sister, No. 23 seed Venus Williams, in a rematch of their fourth round match at Wimbledon. Serena won that match 6-4 6-3, on her way to winning her sixth Wimbledon title. 

Serena is vying for her first career calendar Grand Slam, having won all three of the previous majors in 2015. No female player has achieved the feat since Steffi Graf in 1988.",1106,"an unlikely candidate to dominate a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon champion.

Pacific Daily News, 11:18 p.m. ChST September 7, 2015 

In this file photo, a Navy helicopter searches for a missing swimmer. (Photo: PDN file) 

It was a deadly Labor Day weekend in Guam’s waters and it’s been a deadly year for drowning incidents overall, highlighting the need for people to exercise caution and steps to keep safe in the water. 

A woman was dead after being found in the waters of Tumon Sunday afternoon. The woman was a tourist. Her name, age and nationality weren’t known as of Sunday evening. 

All told there have been nine water-related deaths this year. 

To prevent more tragedies, people must take all necessary precautions when they’ll be on, in or around the water. Take all appropriate safety measures and be aware and cautious of water conditions. 

We urge the public to follow these water safety tips: 
Never swim alone. Stay within an arm’s reach of an inexperienced swimmer. Stay within the reef line. Read and obey all rules and posted signs. Swim in areas supervised by a lifeguard. If you are watching children around water, maintain constant supervision, even if your child can swim and no matter how shallow the water. Use a life jacket or other approved safety floatation devices. Be knowledgeable of the water environment and its potential hazards, such as deep and shallow areas, currents, depth changes, obstructions, and where the entry and exit points are located. Don’t mix alcohol with swimming, diving or boating. Alcohol impairs judgment, balance and coordination, affects your swimming and diving skills and reduces your body’s ability to stay warm. If you get caught in a current or are pulled beyond the reef, remain calm and don’t panic. Swim diagonally to the current until you reach safety. If you can’t find a safe spot, wait for rescuers. If you see someone swept over the reef or pulled out by a current, call 911 immediately — don’t try to go into the water. Wait for trained emergency responders.

He fell into a half doze for most of the day. Even if he intended to disobey Kristoff and explore the area, he would not have had enough energy.              Instead he dozed and dreamed, images from the forest around him melding with remembered scenes from his village, the desert heat of summer wavering in the distance. A cool breeze became the sensation of cool dirt from the water tunnel falling onto his arms, sweaty from the exertion of lifting the shovel. His father dug ahead of him, laughing as Rowen brushed it off. “Careful.”             “It's only dirt.” He heard his own voice, rough and deep. It had just changed.             “Rowen?” He jolted awake to Kristoff standing over him, full of concern. “Have you been keeping hydrated?”             He shook off fuzzy sleep and nodded, taking another sip from the flask next to him. Kristoff was carrying a bird of some sort over his shoulder, along with a bundle of wood. He set both down, kneeling and studying Rowen intently. The redhead leaned back.             “Sorry,” Kristoff finally said. “I just wanted to make sure you hadn't passed out or anything.”             Rowen raised an eyebrow, and Kristoff laughed and stood up again. “Fine, fine. I'm going to make dinner. I'm going to start a fire here, is that okay?”             Why wouldn't it be? Rowen nodded his assent, wishing he knew what kind of assumptions Kristoff was making.             “Let's see if I can remember how.” Kristoff said with some humor, setting up what Rowen presumed to be a fire pit. He had never actually seen one made, though others had explained how it could be done.             Rowen was so hungry he nearly choked on the pheasant and herbs that Kristoff cooked, his eyes watering. As soon as he was done, exhaustion washed over him, and he swayed where he sat.             “Whoa.” The dark haired man caught him, steadying him with minimal contact. “Let's get you back in the cave. You need more rest.”             Rowen shook his head, fighting his sleepiness. He didn't want to go back, he wanted to prove to Kristoff he was strong enough to leave!             “You're well enough to stay awake?” Kristoff asked with obvious disbelief. Rowen nodded as emphatically as he could, sipping from the flask in hope that it would give him more energy.             “Do you think...” Kristoff was peering at him, the firelight flickering in his eyes. “Do you think you will be able to leave soon? I would like you to be looked at by a real physician. And...well, never mind.” He trailed off, looking up at the dark sky.             Rowen tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention and nodded. He wanted to leave. He wanted to get out of here, and go somewhere, do something, so that he would not have to think about what he had left behind. There was nothing left for him.             “Sorry.” Kristoff kept his gaze on Rowen. “I suppose...tomorrow, then, in the morning, we can leave.” Rowen couldn't respond, so Kristoff kept speaking, explaining. “When we arrive, there will be much to do. I will need take you to a woman named Lorana-she will find a place for you. You will be looked over by a doctor first thing, of course, and then assigned to a house, which you may have to share. Does that sound alright?” He waited for Rowen's nod.               “Tomorrow morning, then, I will begin to summon a small thunderstorm-you will get to see a Storm Lord at work for the first time.” He smiled, and Rowen felt an urge to smile back. “With that I can fly back, carrying you.”             Kristoff stirred the fire with a stick, and it flared brighter. “I'll be your mentor, once you're there, but it won't be just me. You will attend classes and learn about the planet and composition of the atomosphere-you'll learn to read and write, too.” Rowen grinned at that. Sometimes he didn't understand everything Kristoff referred to, the man using terms he wasn't familiar with, like planet and atmosphere. The chance to learn them intrigued him.             And then, of course, the chance to write. To be able to communicate again...Excitement prickled his skin just thinking about it, and some of his fatigue lifted.             “While you're learning that, I'll be teaching you about your powers. Usually it takes about a year after you've started schooling before you begin learning them. We don't want to put too much responsibility on a student at once if their powers haven't manifested to the point where they can't control it safely. Which reminds me...um, have they?”             Rowen cocked his head.             “Um, I mean...have you ever, say, wished it to rain and it did? Or maybe got angry or emotional and brought on a lightning strike, or hail, or a breeze...anything like that? Weather phenomena?”             Rowen didn't even have to think about it before shaking his head. If he had any powers at all, the heat spells would not have killed so many. The thought brought back the same distrust that he had felt toward Kristoff since hearing him talk about what the Storm Lords did.             “Hm.” Kristoff frowned. Rowen cursed his handicap for the thousandth time since it had happened. He wanted to know what Kristoff was thinking, but couldn’t ask. Pain constricted his throat as emotions washed over him, so long ignored. Why had he taken the seeds? Why had his parents died? Why didn't the Storm Lords prevent it?             He turned away. That was over with. It would be fixed. He would deal with it.             “Rowen?” Rowen did his best to put on a neutral, curious expression, and Kristoff studied him in silence for a time, still frowning. “Let's get some sleep.

Eighty-six percent of E-rate applicants participating in a recent survey said they are concerned about the Federal Communication Commission’s phase-out of support for voice service, according to recent data.

Forty-eight percent of applicants surveyed have some type of one-to-one or BYOD initiative. Fifty-three percent of participants said they have 1 device per 2-49 students, and 25 percent said their networks support 1 or more device per students. 
 
Sixty-five percent of those surveyed said Wi-Fi is “an absolute requirement,” but most of those respondents have Wi-Fi networks that are three to five years old (37 percent). Twenty-six percent said their Wi-Fi networks are more than five years old.

Any food. 
 
Didn’t really think about it that much. 
 
To me, there were two basic types of food: 
 
A) Food I Liked 
 
B) Food I Didn’t Like 
 
It wasn’t about organic or conventional, raw or cooked, paleo or low carb, gluten-y or gluten-free. Food was either yummy or blech. Food was food. 
 
Of course I was eight years old. 
 
The older I’ve gotten, and the more I’ve read and learned, the more complicated it’s become. 
 
It’s overwhelming. 
 
Being me, not a big rule person, not much of a joiner, kind of scatterbrained, I’ve never followed one school of thought, one particular dietary style. 
 
Over the years as popular dietary fads have come and gone, I’ve sometimes wondered if I should be following one or the other, but by the time I’d had a good think on them, they were already being debunked and unfollowed so I can’t say I’ve ever been in any one camp. 
 
It mostly makes sense to me to eat a balance of fresh, homegrown, home-cooked . . . stuff. 
 
See how scientific I am? 
 
One of the things I’ve debated for a long time is flour. Grains. Bread. 
 
I even tried giving up flour for a while. 
 
It didn’t last very long. Sandwiches weren’t the same wrapped in lettuce. Pancakes. Biscuits. Homemade bread. Muffins. Pizza. Pasta. Food for kids. I missed it. 
 
But I’ve read modern grains are unsuited for our bodies, and how wheat as we know it today isn’t the same species our ancestors consumed. I’ve read how refined flour contains additives and has its nutritive value removed.  As for whole wheat, it oxidizes and quickly becomes rancid once it’s milled. And there’s so much that is unknown about GMOs, herbicides and pesticides. 
 
This led me to look into milling my own organic wheat, corn, and heritage grain. 
 
If I was overwhelmed before, researching grain mills sucked me into another black hole of uncertainty. 
 
Hand-cranked. 
 
Electric. 
 
Convertible. 
 
Burr-ground or impact. 
 
Heat build-up. 
 
Warranties, country of manufacture, types of grains milled, cost. 
 
Noise level. 
 
Materials. 
 
Reputation. 
 
Adjustable grind. 
 
After a few (several) hours of research, I wrote a quick note to a company in Nebraska which imports and sells a German grain mill called KoMo. I confessed the trouble I was having sorting through the choices, and the company, Pleasant Hill Grain , agreed to send me one of their mills to try it out. 
 

 
In two days, I had this thing, the KoMo Classic , and it was the prettiest appliance I’ve ever seen, with all due respect to my 65 year-old mixer. Built like a brick chicken house, it weighs 16 1/2 pounds but only takes up an 8-inch square space on the counter. Much quieter than I expected, I leave it sitting out on the counter ready to go whenever I want to mix up some pancakes for breakfast, grind some corn for cornbread, bake a couple of loaves of bread, make biscuits or muffins, whatever. 
 

 
I don’t have to worry about when I add the grain; I can start the motor before, during, or after I add in the grain. I can adjust the fine-ness of the grind while it’s grinding simply by turning the hopper. I don’t have to clean it out, don’t have to do anything really but mill with it. 
 

 
More about the noise level: I’ve heard people say they have to take their mills (other manufacturers) outside on the porch because they’re so loud. This is nothing like that. This is about the same noise level (or less) than my food processor or blender. 
 
As for speed, I haven’t timed it exactly, but it takes very little time to grind enough flour for two loaves of bread. 
 

 
Taste. The other day when I made my first loaves of yeast bread it was brought home to me how different freshly-milled wheat is even before I baked it; as I was kneading the bread, the smell of the raw dough was making my mouth water. I can’t remember that happening before. The raw dough smelled good enough to eat. 
 
The cornbread is off the chain good. Naturally sweeter, moister, more flavorful. Awesome mouthfeel, albeit a bit crumblier. Who cares about crumbs when the crumbs are so good? 
 
I’m going to shut up about the KoMo for now. I’m planning to grind some kamut soon and I’ll let you know how that goes. I’m so excited to be able to bake and cook with organic heritage grain I don’t know what to do with myself. 
 
This doesn’t provide THE answer to all the questions I have about what to feed my family and myself, but it helps. It helps a lot. Instead of the mystery powder in a bag from the supermarket, the slightly rancid-smelling whole wheat, or the equally mysterious supermarket loaf, I have another level of control over what I feed my family.

213811,b9a8cc74-78bc-4080-84a3-cfaf45a19225,US returns woman to face fraud charges in China,Merced Sun-Star,"A Chinese woman who was convicted and jailed in 2009 for money laundering was returned to China on Thursday, Chinese authorities said, just ahead of a meeting between President Barack Obama with Chinese President Xi Jinping,

Kuang Wanfang, wife of a former Bank of China official, was repatriated following cooperation with U.S. law enforcement, China's Supervision Ministry said. She is the second person to be repatriated to China since Beijing launched the ""Sky Net"" campaign in April to bring back people who are accused of economic crimes and have fled overseas.

The United States lacks an extradition treaty with China and is wary that the country's opaque court system may be unfair to defendants, so it has typically been cautious in turning Chinese nationals over to Beijing.

Kuang is married to Xu Chaofan, who was involved in a $485 million fraud case in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. She and another banker's wife were convicted by a federal jury in Las Vegas of helping launder the proceeds and violating immigration laws, including entering the country illegally and gaining U.S. citizenship through fraud. The women each got eight years in prison.

Their husbands also were convicted on charges of racketeering, money laundering and international transportation of stolen property and fraud. The men were jailed for 25 years and 22 years respectively.

The main culprit, Yu Zhendong, was sent back to China in 2004 on the condition that Yu would not be tortured or given the death penalty, which can be applied in China even for non-violent white-collar crimes. Yu eventually got 12 years in prison.

The ministry said Kuang would face investigation by Chinese authorities on graft and bribery charges. It's unclear if the other three people would be repatriated to China.

Last week, the United States sent back Chinese businessman Yang Jinjun, who is suspected of graft and bribery. His sister, Yang Xiuzhu, has been detained in the United States but is seeking political asylum. The woman, formerly a deputy mayor in the eastern city of Wenzhou, is wanted in China for embezzling more than $40 million.",348,"and is wary that the country's opaque court system may be unfair to defendants, so it has typically been cautious in turning Chinese nationals over to Beijing.

The men were jailed for 25 years and 22 years respectively. The main culprit, Yu Zhendong, was sent back to China in 2004 on the condition that Yu would not be tortured or given the death penalty, which can be applied in China even for non-violent white-collar crimes.

It's unclear if the other three people would be repatriated to China. Last week, the United States sent back Chinese businessman Yang Jinjun, who is suspected of graft and bribery. His sister, Yang Xiuzhu, has been detained in the United States but is seeking political asylum. The woman, formerly a deputy mayor in the eastern city of Wenzhou, is wanted in China for embezzling more than $40 million.","A Chinese woman who was convicted and jailed in 2009 for money laundering was returned to China on Thursday, Chinese authorities said, just ahead of a meeting between President Barack Obama with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Kuang Wanfang, wife of a former Bank of China official, was repatriated following cooperation with U.S. law enforcement, China's Supervision Ministry said.

772626,8084a0ba-9e10-4404-9cb2-302b2293c06e,360 Suada Istanbul,The London Thing,"Hello everyone,
So following up on yesterday’s post, I promised I would share my second dinner in Istanbul, although it was more like an actual experience at 360 Suada Istanbul.
The only thing I want to say is that I wish that I had gone here for an early dinner and stayed out clubbing on Saturday night, instead I chose to go for a later dinner on Sunday night as that was my last night in Istanbul. This was a great way to end my trip to the city on two continents however; I wish I had been able to take better pictures in the sunlight to do the place the justice it deserves.
360 Suada is an award-winning club located on the Galatasaray Island in Bosphorus with the most amazing 360 views of both the Asian and European sides of Istanbul. The restaurant is very vibrant and atmospheric and I’m so grateful that I was able to visit and eat here.
If you read Part 2 of 48hrs in Istanbul, then you know that I initially went for drinks to 360 Beyoglu where I met the restaurant manager Cenk who kindly invited me to dinner at 360 Suada and boy am I glad that I went.
We drank wine and ate food that was recommended by their top waiters, they tend to serve International cuisine with a Turkish twist.
For starters we had a bunch of hot and cold appetizers with roast baby artichoke with dill stalks and anise olive oil; crisp salt and pepper calamari with piquant sweet pepper sambal and shellfish spring rolls with peanut sweat and sour sauce. It was so tasty and delicious and I really enjoyed the mix of different worldly flavours.
For the mains you can already probably guess that we went for a fillet of steak with mushrooms and asparagus being the steak lover that I am.
It really was a great place to end my visit to Istanbul and Cenk was great company. I definitely recommend you hit 360 Suada on a Saturday night for a lively night out on the town with some magnificent views of the Bosphorus bridge.
This is my last post from my Istanbul trip and I really hope that you enjoyed reading them. I have a couple more trips planned and I’m really excited to share them with you guys.
Until then, lots of love!

First thing you notice is that the restaurant is inside the Hilton but even if you do not stay at their property and are on a budget you can still enjoy their food.

Clubing of course!
To be fair with myself though: having read through some reviews online beforehand suggested by friends who hadn’t visited the restaurant yet also hinted towards their being one or two flaws within Turkish traditional cookery inside but still nonetheless praised how wonderful everything tasted (apart where someone got upset over service). As always please note there will undoubtedly never ever compare anything else found elsewhere upon earth because personally speaking – every corner counts when your looking into what makes true taste bud delight occur during dining pleasure moments around town especially anywhere which has gained popularity worldwide too!!

The tune ends up merging with a more modern sonic loop complete with dramatic accents, but that doesn’t take anything away from the power of Hendrix’s 1968 classic. 

The film, which opens Friday, tells the story of a manned mission to Mars that leaves an astronaut stranded and alone on the planet. He tries to find a way to communicate with NASA as they, in turn, try to figure out a way to get him back to Earth. You can watch the trailer for The Martian – which stars Matt Damon, Kristen Wiig and Jeff Daniels – above. 

“All Along the Watchtower” has remained one of the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s most popular tracks. The song was written by Bob Dylan and made its first appearance on his 1967 album John Wesley Harding. 

Hendrix, a Dylan obsessive, recorded the song during the sessions for the Electric Ladyland album. The track was issued as a single in the fall of 1968, and hit the U.S. Top 20 not long after. The album itself would later top the chart in the States.

907990,bbaa78cc-e1fb-419b-b776-5ac830f93062,Multibillion-dollar lobbying caused Daraprim price hike: analysis,The Bellingen Shire Courier-Sun,"How did the US government pass a law that banned it from negotiating the price of drugs? The answer is in the corridors of Congress. Washington: It was a story about a crucial but normally dry issue that ignited outrage around the world.

A former hedge fund manager, Martin Shkreli, founded a start-up company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, that brought the rights to a vital though decades-old drug, Daraprim, and , risking lives of patients who could no longer afford the medication that kept them alive.

Despite Shkreli agreeing to lower the price of the drug after the backlash, the New York Times' revelation of his behaviour this week focused attention on what is arguably a larger scandal – the success pharmaceutical companies have had in boosting the price of drugs in the United States.

Big Pharma's most extraordinary win came in 2003, when Congress passed a law that at once expanded government health insurance for the elderly, known as Medicare, to include prescription drugs.

The law also – and this is not a joke – banned the government from negotiating the prices they would pay the drug companies.

That is, once a drug had been approved for coverage, the government was forced to pay whatever the companies demanded.

This bewildering concession – normally referred to as simply ""Medicare Part D"" – was made after a colossal lobbying effort under the Bush administration in 2003.

The pharmaceutical industry spent a staggering $US2.6 billion on lobbying activities between 1998 and 2012, according to OpenSecrets.org.

That is four times as much as the defence and aerospace industries spend and almost twice the lobbying outlay of oil and gas companies.

According to the Centre for Public Integrity, the pharmaceutical industry employs two lobbyists for each member of Congress and spends $US100 million a year to keep many of those members of Congress on its side.

Medicare Part D was eventually passed after an ugly late-night battle on Capitol Hill.

The vote was held at 3am, but after 15 minutes normally allowed for ballots to be cast, the legislation had failed, so Republican leadership kept the ballot open almost three hours while they twisted arms and offered inducements.

""The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill,"" one disgusted Republican congressman, Walter Jones, told CBS in 2007.

""The bill was over 1000 pages. And it got to the members of the House that morning, and we voted for it at about 3 in the morning.""

The then House Majority Leader, Tom Delay, would later be reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee, which was dominated by his Republican colleagues.

As a result drug prices in the United States are the most expensive in the world.

The issue has now become a focus of the presidential campaign, at least on the Democratic side, and the industry is taking notice.

Hillary Clinton sent the stock price for drug companies plummeting on Monday when she reacted to news of Turing's hikes with a furious tweet, promising to introduce a plan to control drug prices. 

Price gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2015

She announced details on Tuesday, vowing to stop ""excessive profiteering"" by imposing a $US250 monthly cap on prescription drugs. Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Mrs Clinton from the left for the nomination, had already announced a similar plan, but in the wake of the Turing news he has added to it.

""The pharmaceutical industry has become a health hazard for the American people,"" he thundered on Tuesday afternoon.

He would require generic drug companies to rebate money to the government if their prices go up higher than inflation.

Like the Sanders legislation, Mrs Clinton's plan would allow the government to negotiate better prices for the drugs it buys and forbid brand-name companies from paying to keep low-cost competitors off the market.

In addition, Mrs Clinton would allow Americans to buy prescription drugs abroad, most often in Canada, where prices are far lower.

The case of Turing Pharmaceuticals and Daraprim​ is hardly unique. Congress is investigating Valeant Pharmaceuticals after the price for one of their drugs, Isuprel​, went from $US215 per vial to $US1346 per vial.

How energetically that investigation will be prosecuted is anyone's guess.

Soon after buying the pain pill Vimovo​ from AstraZeneca​, Horizon Pharma​ bumped the price up by almost 600 per cent.

For the CEO of Turing, this is nothing new. When Martin Shkreli​ served as chief executive with another drug company, Retrophin​, he increased the price of Thiola, a drug used to treat a disease that causes kidney stones, from $US135 a month to $US2700 a month.

252252,bcfaf89d-3520-415c-ba8e-5e431fe4642b,"Research: Stories, Not Statistics, Can Overcome Compassion Fatigue",European Journalism Observatory - EJO,"Mother Teresa understood compassion fatigue when she proclaimed, “If I look at the mass, I will never act. If I look at one, I will.” 
 
What Mother Teresa knew from personal experience has been documented by behavioral research showing that people relate to the suffering of one as a tragedy but tune out the loss of thousands as a statistic. The recent public reaction to news photos of a young boy’s body, washed up on a Turkish beach is a sad example.  “ The more who die, the less we care ,” grimly concludes psychology professor Paul Slovic, a leading researcher in the field. 
 
Influenced by this research, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof claims to go to great lengths to find an individual who exemplifies the larger story that needs to be told. Rather than focus on suffering and grim statistics, Kristof says he seeks to move his readers by covering people who have overcome their desperate conditions. “To me, the lessons of this research are two-fold,” Kristof explains in the online publication Co-Exist . “First, tell an engaging individual story to suck people in. Second, show that it’s not hopeless, but that progress is possible.” 
 
Does this approach to reporting the news make a difference? 
 
In a study recently published in Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly , I used content analysis and media metrics to assess how Kristof applied these social psychology principles, and, more importantly, whether they engender reader response. The results of this study, “ Compassion Fatigue and the Elusive Quest for Journalistic Impact ,” underscore that there is no “magic bullet” by which the media’s message activates a powerful uniform response. 
 
The first stage of this research examined the threshold issue of whether Kristof practices what he preaches, applying the social psychology principles he publicly espouses. 
 
In an examination of a year’s columns, I found that Kristof routinely put a human face to tough and distant social issues, with a preponderance of stories focused on one or two individuals. His columns widely included elements of triumph over adversity and provided mobilizing information exhorting readers to action. Unwilling to abandon statistics, Kristof injected quantitative information (usually in small amounts) in nearly all of his columns. 
 
While Kristof clearly employed methods intended to overcome compassion fatigue, the effects of these efforts were not apparent. 
 
The study turned to a broad array of Internet metrics to gauge the online reader’s digital response, from Facebook “Likes” to blog references on Google, from the New York Times accounting of most-viewed stories to Technorati’s algorithm gauging a story’s standing in the blogosphere. None of these metrics showed a significant positive relationship with story personification, overcoming adversity, or mobilizing information. 
 
Counter to experimental research indicating that statistics diminish empathy, the study found reader engagement positively corresponded with quantitative information, though the results generally were not statistically conclusive. 
 
However, the study did find that reader response was clearly connected to story topic and geographic proximity. 
 
As predicted, the correlation between reader response and topical issues of high interest to the American public (i.e. abortion, Israeli conflict, presidential election) was positive, strong and statistically significant. By every metric, stories reported in or focused on the United States or Canada engendered greater reader response than foreign stories. 
 
It should be no surprise that Kristof’s column on Lady Gaga’s campaign against bullying elicits greater response than a column about a young woman who had escaped from a Cambodian brothel . These results highlight why news media gravitate to superstars and sensational issues while tough and often distant issues such as human trafficking get relatively little notice. 
 
One wishes there were a simple story formula in which the focus on the individual would trigger a direct emotional response, as it did in the experimental conditions posed by psychological research. 
 
But it would be a mistake to conclude that Kristof’s reporting approach is ineffective. 
 
Despite Kristof’s penchant for reporting on remote and grisly topics, his columns routinely made the New York Times “most popular” list and his professional Facebook page has attracted more than a half-million subscribers. Several charities report that his column generated in excess of U.S. $100,000 in contributions when Kristof wrote about their organizations. Clearly, Kristof has built a large, engaged following as he reports on the disenfranchised around the world. 
 
Indeed, it is possible that Kristof’s unique readership tended to mute the impact of the columnist’s narrative emphasis. As engaged readers, those who comment or otherwise respond to a column may already be well attuned to the issues raised by Kristof. If so, these informed readers likely react more to hard information than a narrative story of an individual’s plight. Supporting this supposition was the finding that the reader’s response was strongest when columns provided information specifically advising what should be done. 
 
The results also may reflect the limitations of the digital metrics used in the study. Personification remains a powerful journalistic device, but audience engagement is a complex phenomenon not readily distilled by algorithm or click count. More research is needed to understand what kinds of reporting elicit public outrage when human rights are violated. 
 
It is hoped that this line of research encourages others to evaluate how social psychology may guide news reporting on genocide and other mass suffering. The answers that communication scholars provide could garner more effective news coverage and elicit a stronger civic response to human suffering.

Indeed, it is possible that Kristof’s unique readership tended to mute the impact of the columnist’s narrative emphasis. As engaged readers, those who comment or otherwise respond to a column may already be well attuned to the issues raised by Kristof. If so, these informed readers likely react more to hard information than a narrative story of an individual’s plight. Supporting this supposition was the finding that the reader’s response was strongest when columns provided information specifically advising what should be done. The results also may reflect the limitations of the digital metrics used in the study. Personification remains a powerful journalistic device, but audience engagement is a complex phenomenon not readily distilled by algorithm or click count. More research is needed to understand what kinds of reporting elicit public outrage when human rights are violated. It is hoped that this line of research encourages others to evaluate how social psychology may guide news reporting on genocide and other mass suffering. The answers that communication scholars provide could garner more effective news coverage and elicit a stronger civic response to human suffering.

(CNN) 

Controversial singer Chris Brown could face yet more tour trouble in the Asia-Pacific region -- and he hasn't even arrived there yet. 

Two months after getting temporarily stuck in the Philippines amid a contract dispute, the R&B artist now appears in danger of being refused entry by Australia over his domestic violence record. 

Brown, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to assaulting Rihanna, his pop star girlfriend at the time, has four big Australian shows scheduled for December. But activists have been calling on the government to deny him a visa. 

Australian Minister for Women Michaelia Cash said Thursday that country's immigration minister ""will be looking at this very, very seriously."" 

""I'm clearly not going to preempt a decision by the minister, however I can assure you what my strong recommendation would be,"" Cash said after mentioning she had in her previous job as assistant minister for immigration prevented an unidentified sportsman from coming to Australia because of his domestic violence record. 

Australian media identified the sportsman in question as Floyd Mayweather, the boxing champion who has pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges at least three separate times. 

Online petition against Brown 

""People need to understand -- if you are going to commit domestic violence and then you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, 'You cannot come in because you are not of the character that we expect in Australia,'"" she told reporters. 

Cash was speaking alongside Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during a news conference at which they announced a series of measures to try to tackle the problem of domestic violence in Australia. 

The community advocacy group GetUp! has launched an online petition urging the Australian government to refuse Brown a visa that has so far received more than 10,000 signatures. 

""Speaking out against Chris Brown has nothing to do with pop music, and everything to do with men's violence against women,"" the petition page says. 

Barred from entering UK, Canada 

It's not the first time Brown's record has drawn scrutiny from immigration officials. 

In 2010, the United Kingdom blocked his plans to perform there, citing concerns he could pose a danger to its citizens. And in February of this year, he canceled shows in Canada after being denied entry at the border. 

Brown could also face difficulties getting into Australia's neighbor New Zealand to play a concert planned for December. 

Immigration law there prevents visas from being granted to anyone who has been excluded from another country, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported last week. The singer will need to obtain a special authorization to enter New Zealand, the broadcaster said.

Annie Musgrove and Jane Allberry started the Meadow Farm Wool Project on a smallholding near Wellington six months ago, and are now able to donate money raised from it to brain injury charity Headway, and Teenage Cancer Trust. 
 
Through the project, Annie and Jane are leasing a sheep to keen knitters, who are then sent balls of Jacob wool. 
 
Jane said: “We are delighted that there has been such a positive interest in the project and we are now in profit. This has enabled us to send our first cheques to the charities and keep a reserve to pay for spinning this year's fleeces.” 
 
Both Jane and Annie’s youngest sons have been helped by the two charities they support and they are keen to find a sustainable way of supporting them without doing any more sponsored runs or walks. 
 
Before starting the project, the wool from the Jacob sheep was going to waste or being sold as insulation material. Keen knitter Jane was impressed with the lovely fleeces and persuaded Annie to consider processing them. 
 
The project has proven popular with knitters from across the globe, with balls of wool being sent to France and California.

256285,ef1b3e8d-f450-4f30-83bd-9931fd0aa790,CIOs embrace hybrid cloud and software-defined data centers,ITworld,"SAN FRANCISCO – Companies building mobile and Web applications to support their digital businesses depend on a mix of private and public clouds to exchange data, said Bill Fathers, VMware's executive vice president and general manager of cloud services, at the company’s VMworld customer event here Monday. Fathers said companies are struggling to deal with a ""fundamental shift in application deployment patterns,” That's forced CIOs to think about ""network architecture and data residency."" In short: how data is moving back and forth between various on-premises systems and cloud environments the apps connect to. VMware is aiming to address these challenges with its unified hybrid cloud, which includes server, storage and network resources designed to enable companies to run any application on any device. The company announced several new software products in support of this initiative. VMware made its name selling server virtualization software, which allows companies to run multiple instances of an operating system on servers, a major shift from the traditional one-OS-per-box approach. Virtualized computing is the hallmark of today’s Web-scale cloud environments, which use commodity servers and software to address spikes in demand. Thanks to considerable internal development, a talent infusion and acquisitions, VMware has extended its automation technologies to storage and the network, offering a software-defined data center that is intended to compete with public cloud services from Amazon Web Services and others. VMware gains trust among CIOs seeking hybrid clouds The hybrid cloud approach appealed to Mike Benson, CIO of DirecTV, who began using VMware in 2008 to virtualize servers. DirecTV has since incorporated VMware storage and network virtualization. Benson said DirecTV must plan for massive spikes in content demand for such things as boxing fights and professional football via TVs as well as computers, smartphones and tablets. He supports this content with a mixed bag of private, public and hybrid cloud services. ""Unified hybrid cloud is our strategy,"" Benson said during the general session. ""We've moved from manual, rigid delivery to software-friendly delivery."" [Related: Google gives VMware huge public cloud boost ] ""Software-friendly delivery"" is essentially a software-defined data center, which enables companies to provision virtual compute, storage and network capabilities automatically rather than setting up equipment and installing software on it. Such software cuts provisioning time for days and weeks to seconds, and is a big selling point for VMware's unified hybrid cloud strategy. Clint Boulton VMware's software-defined data center. (Click for larger image.) CIOs such as Tribune Media's David Giambruno finds this approach is liberating. In 2014, the media company split into Tribune Media and Tribune Publishing. Giambruno remained with Tribune Media, the parent company, but the publishing spinoff took all of the infrastructure with it, leaving him with the daunting task of standing up a new IT environment to support more than 200 applications and 7,000 employees. ""I wanted to take the infrastructure out of the way, and let people do whatever business process transactions they require on any device,"" Giambruno told CIO.com yesterday. Giambruno said he used VMware's software to virtualize 1,200 virtual machines, supported on 70 physical servers, which he says allowed him to easily move applications between the organization as needed. ""It's way simpler bringing up new infrastructure and copying my apps [virtually] rather than picking up literally thousands of servers and moving them [to the new company],"" Giambruno said. He also virtualized the network, and later, the storage capabilities, all of which are supported by a lean IT staff of 43 people. [Related: An Inside Look into VMware’s New Hybrid Cloud Strategy] The VMware system then senses when compute, storage and network capabilities are reaching their capacity threshold and emails and administrators, who then approve the provisioning of new resources. The system does the rest. Giambruno calls it a software-defined data center. But it's also a hybrid cloud, connecting with human resources software such as Workday and budget forecasting software from Anaplan, among other software-as-a-service providers Giambruno uses to operate the business. ""It's what I call indiscriminate computing; my ability to move my assets wherever but maintain security and availability,"" he said. Plenty of clouds to go around Giambruno and Benson are outliers. The majority of CIOs are still struggling with integrating various components of on-premises, private cloud and public cloud solutions and haven't committed to a software-defined data center. VMware must also contend with competition from public cloud providers such as AWS, which has made it simple for anyone from marketing heads to developers to purchase compute resources with a credit card. Netflix, Airbnb, the CIA and other high-profile organizations run large portions of their businesses on AWS, which reported revenues of $5.97 billion for fiscal year 2015. VMware is confident that there is room for multiple cloud providers, particularly those that can help them build software defined data centers in which the infrastructure can be programmed on the fly rather than manually set up and installed. But it marks a cultural shift that's not going to happen overnight, Chris Wolf, vice president and CTO of Americas, told CIO.com. ""There's going to be some resistance and it's going to feel a little uncomfortable for the average technologist in the trenches, but they're going to look back and say 'Why did we ever do it that way?.'""
