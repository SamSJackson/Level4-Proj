BOULDER, CO (PRWEB) September 21, 2015 

Today, CampusBird Interactive Maps & Tours recorded key milestones for their platform usage. The industry-leading map & tour platform proved to be more important than ever with significant increases in traffic and addressable customers during the past two weeks. 

While Google Maps and static PDF's are the norm in the campus-mapping industry, schools around the world are beginning to recognize the value of next generation interactive maps on both the back and front end. ""CampusBird provides Hope's audiences with a beautiful [rendering] of our campus, dedicated features like location-specific media, and plenty of control for our content editors."" says Andrew Myers, the Assistant Director of Admissions at Hope College, ""It's so much more than a Google Map."" Usability on mobile devices is one area where interactive maps are distinguishing themselves on the front end, allowing users to find all of the information they need on the go. Other types of maps simply cannot provide the ease of use and personalized information that users need in order to have a seamless on-campus experience using their mobile devices. 

With nearly 200 clients composed of colleges, universities, community colleges and independent schools, CampusBird Interactive Maps now serve over 1.25 million students worldwide. In addition to serving over one million students, CampusBird has seen an unprecedented spike in web traffic in the past two weeks as the new school year begins. Total web traffic has tripled that of any previous day, while total mobile traffic has risen above the total web traffic of any previous day. More importantly, this level of traffic has stayed steady throughout the past two weeks. 

The spike in CampusBird users and traffic illustrates the need for relevant, usable and comprehensive campus information for students, visitors and employees. ""We are fortunate to work with leading marketers, facilities managers, admissions officers, technologists and others at top schools worldwide."" Commented CampusBird CEO, Oliver Davis. ""Their partnership is the true validation of CampusBird's product and service leadership.""

4,627873,96250f7d-2de5-4ecc-8561-34d523aa6ab3,Bergen: 10 ways to defeat ISIS,News,WYFF4.com,"On Tuesday, President Obama meets in New York with world leaders to discuss how the campaign against ISIS is going and how it might be improved. 
 
Earlier this month, the outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said that the war is ""tactically stalemated"" and there are no ""dramatic gains on either side."" 

Here are some ideas about how to move forward: 

1. Enlist defectors from ISIS to tell their stories publicly. Nothing is more powerful than hearing from former members of the group that ISIS is not creating an Islamist utopia in the areas it controls, but a hell on earth. The flow of ""foreign fighters"" to ISIS from around the Muslim world is estimated to be about 1,000 a month. Reducing that flow is a key to reducing ISIS' manpower. 

2. Amplify voices such as that of the ISIS opposition group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which routinely posts photos online of bread lines in Raqqa and writes about electricity shortages in the city. This will help to undercut ISIS propaganda that it is a truly functioning state. 

3. Amplify the work of former jihadists like the Canadian Mubin Shaikh, who intervenes directly with young people online who he sees are being recruited virtually by ISIS. 

4. Support the work of clerics such as Imam Mohamed Magid of northern Virginia, who has personally convinced a number of American Muslims seduced by ISIS that what the group is doing is against Islam. 

5. Keep up pressure on social media companies such as Twitter to enforce their own Terms of Use to take down any ISIS material that encourages violence. Earlier this year, Twitter quietly took down 2,000 accounts used by ISIS supporters, but the group continues to use Twitter and other social media platforms to propagate its message. 

6. Keep up the military campaign against ISIS. The less the ISIS ""caliphate"" exists as a physical entity, the less the group can claim it is the ""Islamic State"" that it purports to be. 

7. Applaud the work that the Turks have already done to tamp down the foreign fighter flow through their country to ISIS in neighboring Syria, and get them to do more. 

8. Provide ""off ramps"" to young ISIS recruits with no history of violence, so that instead of serving long prison terms for attempting to join ISIS -- as they presently do in the United States -- they would instead serve long periods of supervised probation. 

This will help families that presently face a hard choice: If they suspect a young family member is radicalizing and they go to the FBI, that person can end up in prison for up to 15 years on charges of attempting to support ISIS; but if they don't go to the authorities and their child ends up traveling to Syria, he or she may well end up being killed there. Providing off ramps would offer families a way out of this almost impossible choice. 

Three of Shafi and Zarine Khan's teenaged children were arrested by the FBI last year at Chicago's O'Hare Airport as they attempted to join ISIS. The Khans say they would have intervened effectively with their children if they had known they were radicalizing, but now their oldest son, Hamzah, faces 15 years in prison, despite the fact he has no history of violence nor does the government allege he was a planning a violent act. 

9. Educate Muslim parents about the seductive messages that ISIS is propagating online. 

10. Relentlessly hammer home the message that ISIS positions itself as the defender of Muslims, but its victims are overwhelmingly fellow Muslims.",3521,"On Tuesday, President Obama meets in New York with world leaders to discuss how the campaign against ISIS is going and how it might be improved.

I tried to find out the nature of the charge by emailing Hertz twice, and received no reply. 

I then called its customer-service number and was told I had to call the local rental office. When I finally reached someone, I was advised that the charge was likely because they smelled tobacco in the car when it was returned. 

I explained that I had never smoked in my life, and that no one riding in the car had smoked. Nevertheless, the agent claimed we left a smoking odor and said the charge would not be waived or adjusted. 

Knowing that this was not true, I contacted Hertz’s national customer service and was told that a regional manager would look into it. I have not received any reply or further contact. 

I would like to be reimbursed for the charge and also bring attention to this untrue, unfair and arbitrary practice if it is occurring at Hertz locations. 

Jonathan Beyer, West Palm Beach, Florida 

A: Hertz has a strict ”no smoking” policy for all of its cars. If you light up in one of its rentals, you may be charged a $100 fee to cover the cost of vehicle cleaning. De-smoking takes a vehicle out of service for up to 24 hours so it can be cleaned with a natural deodorizer and an oxidation process. 

If your car smelled smoky, then a representative should have noticed it immediately and said something. When you return a vehicle, an employee will sit in the driver’s seat and make a note of your mileage. At that point, someone should have said something to you. 

This was a textbook case of how not to handle a claim. First, Hertz didn’t explain the charge. Then it stonewalled you. When the company finally offered you details, it didn’t follow up as promised on your request for a review. 

Tsk, tsk. 

You could have leapfrogged the lower-level contacts and appealed directly to one of the managers I list on my website (elliott.org/company-contacts/hertz). 

Did someone smoke in your car? Maybe. But it could have happened anytime, including after you returned your vehicle or after the next renter returned the vehicle. Hertz really needs to document an incident like this better. And it should have been prepared to show you the proof – if indeed it exists – that you smoked. Photos of cigarette butts in the ashtray would do just fine. An invoice with ”other”? Not fine. 

I contacted Hertz on your behalf. It reviewed your case and contacted you with an apology and a full refund of the $5",2516,"Q: I recently received a $50 ”other” charge when I rented a car from Hertz in New Orleans.

The study also showed that they had higher risks of clogged arteries , heart failure , and reduced blood flow to the limbs. 

Better results for diabetics who quit smoking 

The risks were lower for diabetics who quit smoking, but still moderately higher than risks among never smokers, the researchers write in the journal Circulation . 

Lead author An Pan told Reuters Health by email that smoking is still common among people with diabetes, despite efforts to discourage it. 

""We wanted to know whether smoking was related to total mortality and cardiovascular events among diabetic patients, and whether smoking cessation would reduce the risks,"" said Pan, who is a professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. 

Smoking is even worse for diabetes sufferers 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking can worsen the health risks that go along with diabetes, such as heart and kidney disease , nerve damage, and blindness. 

Pan's team pooled the data from 89 earlier studies of smoking among adults with type 2 diabetes and found that diabetic smokers were around 1.5 times more likely to experience clogged arteries, stroke, overall heart disease, and heart failure. 

In addition, smokers were more than twice as likely to suffer from peripheral artery disease, or reduced blood flow to the limbs, than patents who did not smoke. 

Former smokers had 1.2 times the risk of clogged arteries and 1.1 times the risk of overall heart disease, compared to never-smokers. 

Using the risk estimates from their review and global rates of deaths from diabetes, the researchers estimated that smoking accounted for 14.6 percent of deaths in diabetic men and 3.3 percent of deaths in diabetic women worldwide. 

Dr. Wael Al-Delaimy, division chief of global health at the University of California, San Diego, said part of the problem may be the care diabetes patients receive. 

""The physician caring for the diabetes patient might be focusing on cardiovascular risk factors or diabetes complications and diet and weight control while neglecting smoking as another important risk factor,"" Al-Delaimy told Reuters by email. 

Pan said some smokers may be reluctant to quit due to concerns about gaining weight in the short term. However, he noted, ""The long-term benefits clearly overweigh the short-term side effects."" 

Pan advises diabetic patients who are smokers ""to seek professional help to quit smoking."" 

Al-Delaimy agreed, saying, ""If you are a patient suffering from diabetes and smoking cigarettes, or if you know a family member, friend or anyone else who is diabetic and smoking, there is still opportunity to substantially decrease further complications and suffering or even early death by quitting smoking.""

Although shoppers who pick up produce while they are at the grocery store rarely suspect that the food they will eventually consume could make them severely ill, cases of foods infected with serious contaminants, like Salmonella, are far too common. In a recent case, according to NBC News, a batch of cucumbers imported to the U.S. from Mexico spread Salmonella to 33 states, resulting in 285 people becoming severely ill. Additionally, CDC reports three deaths have been reported from Arizona (1), California (1), and Texas (1). 

 
People first began showing up at hospitals and other healthcare facilities with Salmonella poisoning in early July, but it wasn't until early September that Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce, the distributors of the cucumbers, recalled the cucumbers called into question. The cucumbers affected by this contaminant were sold under a ""Limited Edition"" brand label and were each dark green and seven to 10 inches in length. 

 
As a result of this widespread salmonella outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control issued a statement that said retailers should not sell, restaurants should not use, and consumers should not eat any of the cucumbers that were previously recalled. Additionally, the organization remarked that anyone who is unsure about the exact source of their cucumbers should refrain from consuming them. 

 
When a person becomes infected with Salmonella, he or she will likely experience a fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps for 12 to 72 hours after the infection takes hold. Although the illness usually does not last for more than a few days, in some cases, the resulting diarrhea can result in the need for hospitalization. When a person needs to be hospitalized from a Salmonella infection, the bacteria may spread from the person's intestines into the blood stream. Unless promptly treated with antibiotics, the illness can cause death, especially among the elderly, young children, and those who suffer from a weakened immune system. 

 
Even though hundreds of people reportedly became ill during this Salmonella outbreak, many more may have been infected by the contaminated cucumbers. According to the CDC, on an annual basis in the U.S. approximately 40,000 Salmonella cases are reported. However, since milder cases of these infections are generally not reported, the number of infections could be at least 30 times greater. 

 
Those who contract a foodborne illness, like Salmonella, even if they survive, may find that the illness affects their quality of life and that it takes them several months to fully recover. In situations like these, legal assistance can prove to be invaluable.

That would be unconscionable. Some European officials may be tempted to adopt the hard-line approach Australia has used to stem a similar tide of migrants. That would be unconscionable. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has overseen a ruthlessly effective effort to stop boats packed with migrants, many of them refugees, from reaching Australia's shores. His policies have been inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war.

Since 2013, Australia has deployed its navy to turn back boats with migrants, including asylum seekers, before they could get close to its shores. Military personnel force vessels carrying people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea and other conflict-roiled nations toward Indonesia, where most of the journeys begin. A boat captain recently reported that Australian authorities paid him $30,000 to turn back. If true, that account, which the Australian government has not disputed, would represent a violation of international laws designed to prevent human smuggling and protect asylum seekers.

Those who have not been turned back are held at detention centres run by private contractors on nearby islands, including the tiny nation of Nauru. A report this week by an Australian Senate committee portrayed the Nauru centre as a purgatory where children are sexually abused, guards give detainees marijuana in exchange for sex and some asylum seekers are so desperate that they stitch their lips shut in an act of protest. Instead of stopping the abuses, the Australian government has sought to hide them from the world.

The Border Force Act, which took effect July 1, makes it a crime punishable by a two-year prison sentence for employees at detention camps to discuss the conditions there publicly. Australia and Nauru, which depends heavily on Australian foreign aid, have gone to great lengths to keep international journalists from gaining access to the detention centre, in which more than 2200 people have been held since 2012. Last year, Nauru raised the fee it charges for journalists' visas from $200 to roughly $8000; applicants who are turned down are not given refunds.

Scores of people who have worked at the camp have become whistle-blowers. More than 40, including medical personnel and social workers, wrote a public letter to senior government officials in July saying they would rather risk arrest than stay quiet. ""If we witness child abuse in Australia we are legally obliged to report it to child protection authorities,"" they wrote. ""If we witness child abuse in detention centres, we can go to prison for attempting to advocate for them effectively.""

European officials have travelled to Australia on fact-finding missions recently. Mr Abbott, who argues that aggressively intercepting the boats saves lives, has urged European governments to follow his model, and some European leaders seem so inclined.

""The Australian model may seem attractive to politicians,"" said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration. ""Politicians love fences, but what fences do is create a market for smugglers and major humanitarian problems.""

The world's war zones are all but certain to continue to churn out an extraordinary number of refugees and economic migrants in the years ahead. Those people understandably will head to the most prosperous nations, hoping to rebuild their lives. It is inexcusable that some find themselves today in situations that are more hopeless and degrading than the ones that prompted them to flee.

To some observers Australian policy had become too radicalised about seeking refuge among desperate Syrians against whom no other solution can compete than allowing others thousands upon millions more displaced persons through diplomatic channels all along its journey eastward—and now there seems little if anything else yet left for political engagement elsewhere like Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey –that does just what Mr Morrison wants - but nothing works exactly how he'd hoped...

I was sitting next to the cash register in Brad’s Place Thursday, enjoying a toasted sandwich packed with lettuce, tomatoes and three slices of hot greasy bacon. “Best BLT east of the traffic light,” boasted owner Dan Devine. 
 
Grillmaster Phil Courtemanche walked past me and asked,  “You gonna write about Orsillo?” 
 
He was referring to Don Orsillo, the longtime Red Sox TV announcer who’s getting the boot after 15 seasons. The higher-ups at NESN reportedly wanted Orsillo and sidekick Jerry Remy to tone down their giggle-fests over hairstyles, mistyped promos, inappropriate camera shots … anything that caught their fancy when the games got boring. 
 
At first the laughter was spontaneous and genuine, but eventually it felt contrived and NESN wanted them to end the shtick. 
 
Orsillo is nonetheless an able play-by-play caller and popular with fans. At this writing 57,880 supporters had signed an Internet petition (on change.org ) asking owner John Henry and NESN to reconsider their decision. 
 
It wouldn’t be the first time a popular baseball announcer was fired and subsequently called back to duty. In 1964, Mel Allen was fired after 25 years doing the Yankees’ games, then rehired when George Steinbrenner bought the team. 
 
In 1991, Tigers announcer Ernie Harwell was fired after 31 seasons. He was axed by Bo Schembechler, the former University of Michigan football coach who somehow wound up running a baseball team. A year later, Mike Ilitch bought the Tigers and put Harwell back in the booth, a move that made the new owner immediately popular with the fans. 
 
Harwell’s Hall of Fame induction speech on Aug. 2, 1981, is a classic. You can Google it or watch it on YouTube. Here’s a small part of what Harwell recited that day in Cooperstown: 
 
“Baseball is a rookie, his experience no bigger than the lump in his throat as he begins the fulfillment of his dream. It’s a veteran too, a tired old man of 35 hoping that those aching muscles can pull him through another sweltering August and September. Nicknames are baseball, names like Zeke and Pie and Kiki, and Home Run and Dizzy and Dazzy and Cracker. 
 
“Baseball is the cool, clear eyes of Rogers Hornsby. The flashing spikes of Ty Cobb, an over-aged Pixie named Rabbit Marranville.” 
 
Harwell died of cancer in 2010, leaving 87-year-old Vin Scully as the lone baseball broadcasting icon from the 20th century. On late nights I’ll scroll through the SXM channels and find Scully doing a Dodgers game. I’ll turn up the volume, settle back in my seat and listen to the last of the all-time greats. 
 
When news broke that Orsillo had been fired, I called Jerry Trupiano at his home in Franklin. “Trupe” was the radio voice of the Red Sox from 1993 to 2006 and was best known for his “Way back!” home run calls. They inspired the nickname for pitcher John Wasdin, who was called “Way Back Wasdin” after he gave up 18 home runs in 1997. 
 
Asked if Orsillo’s firing evoked memories of his own dismissal, Trupiano chuckled and said, “I promised my wife I wouldn’t talk about this because it really would not do me any good. I feel bad for Don. When the smoke clears, I’ll give him a call.” 
 
Trupiano’s replacement was the immortal Glenn Geffner, who stayed for one season in Boston and left for Miami where he still remains as the Marlins’ radio announcer. 
 
Meanwhile, at Fenway Park, Dave O’Brien will replace Orsillo. O’Brien’s a good announcer, but not so good they had to get rid of Orsillo.

Two weeks ago today the Cincinnati Reds unveiled a statue of Tony Perez at the Great American Ballpark. The Cuban-born Perez hit 379 home runs in 22 years and was a cog in the city’s Big Red Machine that beat Boston in the 1975 World Series. To create the statue, sculptor Tom Tsusciya used a photo of Perez swinging at a Bill Lee pitch in Game Six. Not just any pitch, but Spaceman’s eephus pitch that Perez crushed out of the park and into orbit alongside Halley’s Comet.

American Pharoah wasn’t the only track star to come up short last week. At the world championships in Beijng, the U.S. Track & Field team finished third behind Jamaica and Kenya in gold medals. They both had eight. The U.S. had seven.

Pablo Sandoval is the second coming of Carlos Beltran. In 2004, Beltran batted .258 in the last 90 games for Houston. Then in the postseason he hit four home runs and had a .563 on base percentage. 
 
Beltran subsequently signed a $119 million contract with the Mets and reverted to form with a .266 average in 2005. 
 
Sandoval similarly went crazy in the playoffs after a so-so regular season. The Red Sox signed him for six years and $107 million and he’s ranked 35th among MLB third basemen by ESPN.

Squibbers: Former UMass quarterback Mike McEvilly was spotted in the Franklin County courthouse last month. The Leominster-based attorney co-captained the 1979 team that went 6-4 under the late Bob Pickett. … Talking Deflategate on SXM Radio, co-host Pat Kirwan said: “We had the guy on here who invented the airbag. He said all footballs are leaky seives.” … Trainer Bob Baffert is now 2-for-40 in Saratoga stakes races after American Pharoah was vanquished by Keen Ice. Baffert wanted no part of the Travers. The loss is on owner Ahmed Zayat, who thought his colt was unbeatable. … Today’s quote submitted by Tom Murphy of Stuart, Fla., and uttered by the late singer/actress Dorothy Sarnoff: “Make sure you have finished speaking before your audience has finished listening.”… The Patriots will go 10-6 and finish in a three-way tie with Buffalo and the Dolphins, then lose to the Steelers in the AFC semifinals.

The view after the 2011 Gold Cup was such that Gulati sacked Bob Bradley and replaced him with Klinsmann.   The current style and makeup of Klinsmann’s setup has come under increased scrutiny. Clearly he’s on shaky footing right now, given the dire performances versus Jamaica and Panama to close out this summer’s regional test. Every match that passes leaves the team appearing ill-managed – holding onto ageing players like Jermaine Jones, Kyle Beckerman, and Chris Wondolowski, while asking talented players to adapt to new tactical roles (Michael Bradley and Alejandro Bedoya more recently).   Should a dire loss to Mexico in October mean a coaching change? In past years when qualifying would have started in the next calendar year, I would have agreed. The past several months of USMNT play has underwhelmed. Even some of the players Klinsmann wrested away from rival nations have failed to impress. This is especially evident in John Brooks and Ventura Alvarado, who have not passed the smell test.   But with World Cup Qualifying being the real prize, can Gulati afford to make a change a mere month ahead of the opening match? Would that place Klinsmann’s successor at a disadvantage, having to deal with whatever chaos comes from the change? Not to forget being tossed into qualifying with a group that has underperformed of late.   It’s true that the United States received a favorable draw in Round 4 with Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines likely presenting only a minor challenge. And maybe Group C could be viewed as an appetizer to the real meal, the Hexagonal. Out of the three groups, it’s the one you’d want if you were bringing the team up to speed with a new coach.   Still, it’s a risk. But is it a bigger risk than beginning the 2018 cycle with Klinsmann calling the shots? That’s the question that lies ahead should the US stumble against Mexico next month.   But realize that the Gold Cup failures could have been the nail in Klinsmann’s coffin, if Gulati had pulled the plug. By not doing so, it heaps more pressure on Klinsmann for the Confederations Cup Playoff in October. A loss there would only reinforce what many already believed – that it should have been done in August.   The Post-Gold Cup solidarity with Klinsmann is a stand that Gulati may have to ride out, for better or for worse. If somehow the US fails to make Russia 2018, would Klinsmann really be the only one to blame?",3177,"After sputtering out of the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup in dreadful fashion, the calls for Jurgen Klinsmann’s firing as Head Coach further intensified. A Jeckyl and Hyde performance against Peru and the shellacking at the hands of Brazil in suburban Boston only tossed kerosene on the flames. A large contingent of US fans and media are pushing the Confederations Cup play-in match against Mexico as a “win or be gone” match for Klinsmann. But is that a wise change to make at this point?

via http://ift.tt/1K9WYwC Abstract Background The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of job strain, as measured by the Karasek demand/control model (DCM), on smoking cessation and relapse in a representative general population sample. Methods A secondary analysis of data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) was undertaken. Daily smokers and former daily smokers (n=1287 and 1184, respectively) at cycle 1 (1994/1995) of the NPHS were followed up at cycle 2 (1996/1997). Measures of job strain (the independent variables) were based on data from cycle 1, predicting smoking status at cycle 2. Logistic regression analysis was employed in two ways. Individuals were stratified into job strain quartiles while continuous measures were also employed in separate analyses for job strain and its component dimensions. Results In the quartile analysis, no effect of job strain was observed on the likelihood of cessation, while a non-linear effect was observed on the likelihood of relapse, although this relationship lost significance (p>0.05 and <0.10) after controlling for personal characteristics. No effect was observed using the continuous measure of job strain or the continuous measure of job demand on either cessation or relapse. For job control, no effect was observed on the likelihood of cessation, but increased control was found to decrease the likelihood of relapse in the unadjusted model only. Conclusions Psychosocial work environments may be too diverse for uniform trends in the relationship between job stress and smoking behaviour to emerge in a population sample. Future research should avoid use of the scaled-down DCM instrument where possible.",1784,"from Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health current issue http://ift.tt/1K9WYwC via http://ift.tt/1K9WYwC Abstract Background The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of job strain, as measured by the Karasek demand/control model (DCM), on smoking cessation and relapse in a representative general population sample.

This blog will summarize my main founding’s from the literature about the future of social commerce, and the possible shortcomings of it. The blog will start with a general explanation of social commerce and how to implement it. Next, I will discuss the disadvantages of using social commerce. Finally, I will provide you with some examples of future social commerce. 

 

Social commerce is a subset of electronic commerce that involves social media, online media that supports social interaction and user contributions to assist online buying and selling of products and services (Wikipedia, 2015).

So where do you start when you want to implement a social commerce strategy? According to Marsden, one should start by listening. Search for examples from bigger companies and watch how they use social media. After this comes the experiment part. When you have results, you can start applying the strategy and keep on developing.

Darrell Rigby discusses how retailers should catch up on social commerce. Rigby states that retailers should follow tree steps to catch up with social commerce. 1. Retailers should face reality. 2. Retailers should think like they are starting over. 3. Retailers should use social networking. (Rigby, 2011)

Rhonda Abrons states a few things that are inconsistent with the statements of Rigby. Social commerce is time intensive. This raises the question whether a sole proprietorship can afford to spend so much time on social media and whether the advantages out weight the disadvantages. She also states that the costs of social advertising are high and therefore not every company can afford it.

One of the reasons that people still like to shop physically is because people like to shop together and interact. It’s not just the buying part but also the experience and social aspect that makes shopping together a nice alternative for online shopping. In the future, many companies using social commerce are providing customers with ways to shop online together.

As a result of this development in online shopping Zhu, Benbasat and Jiang conducted a research about shopping online together focusing on navigation support and communication support. Results showed that shared navigation decreased the amount of decoupling (the loss of coordination with one’s shopping partner.

One interesting development is the introduction of the buy button on many social platforms. For customers it will be easier to buy, and social platforms and third parties will get more profits.

Another interesting development in social commerce is Snapcash, a brand name of Snapchat. Snapcash has a totally different goal than Snapchat, namely: transferring money. With the use of Snapcash you can send money to another person just by typing in their name and the amount of money you want to send.

Godolphin trainer John O'Shea demanded stewards swab his two beaten runners over suspicions they might have been doped after stablemate and favourite Exosphere won the Golden Rose at Rosehill on Saturday. ""I would like them swabbed because we can't he be sure what might have happened to them,"" O'Shea said to stewards.

It was O'Shea's biggest moment in the blue when Exosphere roared to victory but O'Shea could not enjoy the win in the $1million group1 and the stallion implications for Exosphere as he worried about his other colts, which tailed the field in.

""It is a fantastic day for the team and Exosphere is a super horse but, to tell you the truth, I was watching the other two [drop out] at the end,"" O'Shea said. ""There is something not right there.

""They worked unbelievably on Tuesday and that was not them.

""It is very special to win it. I have had him [Exosphere] since he was a baby. He ran home in 33 [seconds for his last 600metres] and I don't think there was anything that could have beaten him.""

Exosphere was stabled at Agnes Banks while Holler and Shards were at Warwick Farm.

Chairman of stewards Ray Murrihy said Racing NSW investigators would be sent to Godolphin's Crown Lodge stables at Warwick Farm on Monday to find out if anything had happened to the horses.

""They have very good security,"" Murrihy said. ""We will look at their

videos and the swabs from the two horses. We are aware there is a virus at Warwick Farm but we want to lay any other doubts to rest.""

Holler and Shards appeared to pull up well but, after the race, O'Shea's thoughts were a long way from the winner. He headed to the stewards room straight after the presentation and asked for Holler and Shards to be swabbed.

""I'm perplexed by the other two,"" O'Shea said. ""We thought they were very good chances and my staff are very concerned about them.

""I don't know what has happened to them. They were both at Warwick Farm together and next to each other here at the track.""

Godolphin was worried about Holler before the race when he was nervous. ""He started to scour when we put on the saddle,"" O'Shea said. ""He was nervous, which is completely out of character for him.""

Sam Clipperton said Holler was beaten at the top of the straight after sitting outside the lead at a soft speed and, when put under pressure, there was nothing there.

As Holler dropped out, Exosphere exploded through a gap between him and leader Speak Fondly to score by 2 lengths from the filly with Sebring Sun coming down the centre to run third a half-length away.

James McDonald said he was patient and used Exosphere's turn of foot to demoralise his rival.

""He is a super colt and that for John and the team is fantastic,"" he said. ""I knew I had Press Statement in a pocket and waited and waited and, when I went, nothing was going to go with me.""

As Exosphere got the winning run, second favourite Press Statement was left looking for somewhere to go and eventually finished fifth.

""One of them got the run and we didn't,"" Press Statement's trainer Chris Waller said. ""We were still looking for a run at the 100m, so we didn't really get a crack at them.""

Gai Waterhouse was delighted with Speak Fondly, which beat all the colts but one.

""She's such a good filly. I suppose you've got history against you, don't you? The horse that was primed to win the race won it and the colts make the weight-for-age improvement.""

A Sydney dance teacher has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting children in his classes and using them to produce child pornography. Grant William Davies, who taught at RG Dance in Chiswick, was arrested in May 2013 after his wife found inappropriate messages to a student on his phone. RG Dance closed a month later.

Davies, 40, admitted in the Sydney Downing Centre District Court on Monday to offences involving a victims aged between nine and 14.

Wearing a blue open necked shirt and black coat, his hair cropped short, Davies pleaded guilty to charges including sexual intercourse without consent, indecent assault and the production of child abuse material.

The offences were committed between 2002 and 2013.

A victim, who did not wish to be identified, said the guilty plea was ""a just outcome for victims such as myself and the wider community"".

""It was an abuse of trust and of his position of authority,"" he said.

The victim said he no longer danced but he had faith in the police and the Department of Public Prosecutions.

""Hopefully it demonstrates to similar offenders that such conduct will be prosecuted.""

Last September, a Sydney mother was jailed for 18 months for sending Davies sexually explicit and degrading images of her daughters.

""I knew it wasn't right ... I could have just got up and walked out, I know that now,"" the woman told the Downing Centre District Court.

The mother said she had been scared Davies would relegate her daughters to ""back row"" parts in dance concerts.

The court heard in March that Davies' trial could have taken up to three months due to the large number of complainants and charges.

Davies will return to court early next year for sentencing.

Global-Tech Advanced Innovations Inc. (GAI) today announced its net sales and earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2016). 

Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 ended June 30, 2015 were $15.3 million, compared to net sales of $24.6 million for the corresponding quarter in fiscal 2015. Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was $1.0 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.10 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

John C.K. Sham, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said: ""As anticipated, net sales decreased significantly when compared to the prior corresponding period, due almost entirely to declining sales in commodity CCMs, a lower price-point category where increases in labor and overhead costs have eliminated any advantage previously held over competitors."" 

Mr. Sham continued, ""Despite a decrease in overall sales, average unit pricing improved as a result of a more favorable product mix and our efforts to control production costs, leading to increases in profit margins."" 

Mr. Sham concluded, ""The outlook on our overall business is tempered by growing sentiment of a slowing Chinese economy together with the potential impacts of the recent devaluation of the Chinese currency, as much of our business is U.S. dollar related. We do not expect our business to improve in the near future as our customers are likely to take a conservative position to reduce excess inventory and are prepared to make further cost reductions if necessary in an effort to protect our continued viability.""

26,443044,60a256e4-7945-4dc5-b8a0-42f4818a3133,Love Letters They don’t want to be his boyfriend,News,Boston Globe,"Q. I’m a guy in my late 20s, and I’ve had my own set of successes dating-wise in terms of meeting new people, etc., but one place where I keep experiencing challenges is when a relationship converts from dating to “we are boyfriends,” and what happens after that. I feel like I’m generally well-intentioned, giving, communicative about my expectations, etc., and then at some point, the other guy seems to shut down and dumps me with either six hours warning or a week of lifeless texts. During the breakup, they say “you have so much of what I want in a partner but I don’t feel this is right.” They’re normally not willing to try any modifications to the relationship to try to make things work better. For the last few years of breakups, the guys who have done this at some point reappear months later with the desire to work things out. Is there any way to stop this cycle? A. The cycle is called dating. It’s all about stops and starts until something sticks. Sometimes people bail. Sometimes they return.

Continue reading below 

Two things to consider as you continue with the delightful process of finding a boyfriend: 1) Are you sure that you’ve wanted to commit to all of these guys? It sounds like these men have trouble getting to the next step, but maybe you could spend some more time thinking about what you really want before you jump to the boyfriend label. 2) What does the “we are boyfriends” status mean? If all it means is exclusivity (as opposed to deep commitment), make that clear. Labels can be scary if they’re not defined.

I know this is exhausting, but that’s why there are so many television shows and movies about finding love. It’s quite a climb. READERS RESPOND: 

Perhaps you are being too clingy? I think in my younger years I probably was and of course scared a number of good guys away. Oh well. Maybe you are doing things backward. Instead of trying to find a boyfriend, date a few guys and see if one of them becomes your boyfriend. How soon after you start dating someone do you decide to be boyfriends? Maybe you are doing it too soon before you really get to know whether the other person is compatible with you or not. Do any of these guys give you any indication of a problem in the relationship before they break up with you or is it always out of the blue? Are you not listening maybe when someone has an issue with what you are doing and then they get fed up? Can you ask a close platonic friend if he notices anything you are doing that turns people off? Otherwise, it’s just bad luck and very common that you have to date a bunch of people before you find the right one. You might be dating the wrong guys. You might be trying to get too serious too quickly. I don’t know, but try to relax and enjoy dating. Date lots of people and strive for what it is that you want, cut off the ones who can’t meet your expectations quickly. If the you feel the need for modifications just end it. That’s a sign you are wasting your time. Surround yourself with good people and have fun. This is a pattern, not a coincidence. Take a peek into your past, your parents history (especially when you were percolating in mom) and your history with your parents. As Carl Jung said “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” “I feel like I’m generally well-intentioned, giving, communicative about my expectations, etc.” That’s all you can be. As long as you’re communicating what you’re looking for, things should eventually fall into place. Part of dating is meeting people at the right time when both of you are ready for a relationship. If you have to start your relationship by making modifications, you’re doing it wrong! I wish I could offer some decent advice but this just sounds like dating to me. Get Today’s Headlines

27,598012,465efbb4-f9cd-400f-8b36-9e1304063db4,Feds charge Kansas priest with bank fraud over parish thefts,News,Columbus Republic,"WICHITA, Kansas — A Kansas priest charged Tuesday with stealing nearly $151,000 from two parishes and the Catholic Diocese of Wichita used the money to fund his gambling, federal prosecutors alleged. 
 
Documents filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita charge Father Thomas H. Leland with one count of bank fraud. 
 
Leland was assigned in 2010 to St. Francis Parish in St. Paul and St. Ambrose Parish in Erie, both located in southeast Kansas. He is no longer active with the diocese, spokeswoman Amy Pavlacka said. 
 
Court records do not list a defense attorney who could comment on his behalf, and church officials had no contact information for him. 
 
""The charges filed today reflect a difficult time for the Catholic Diocese of Wichita,"" Pavlacka said in an email. ""Our priorities throughout have been to assist and secure the financial well-being of St. Francis and St. Ambrose Catholic parishes, which we have done, and to help Fr. Leland navigate this difficult time with justice and mercy."" 
 
Both parishes have ""turned the page,"" and are thriving under new leadership, she said. 
 
Prosecutors allege that between 2012 and April 2014, Leland executed a scheme to defraud the two parishes and the diocese. 
 
""During that time period Father Leland began gambling extensively and funded that endeavor with funds embezzled from the victims,"" the government said in its filing. 
 
Leland, the only priest assigned to the parishes, had sole signature authority on each of the parishes' bank accounts, prosecutors said. 
 
The government alleged Leland took overpayments totaling $2,063 for conducting Mass; took unauthorized salary advancements and salary overpayments totaling $138,200; and took unauthorized reimbursements for personal expenses totaling $10,656.
