0,964344,6dd62a1a-3a6c-4129-ac9d-01f1b957db1c,Sanders Takes Biden-Proof Lead over Clinton in New Hampshire,News,Common Dreams,"Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders now boasts the support of nearly half of those who say they plan to vote in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Democratic primary next year, and his lead over national front-runner Hillary Clinton has widened to 16 points, according to a new poll from CNN/WMUR-New Hampshire. 
 
Forty-six percent of poll (pdf) respondents said that if the primary were held today, they would support Vermont Sen. Sanders, while just 30 percent said they back former Secretary of State Clinton. Another 14 percent say they would support Vice President Joe Biden, 2 percent like former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, 1 percent go for former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, and less than half of 1 percent back former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee or Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig. 
 
The results echo other recent surveys , all of which show Sanders with a solid advantage in the Granite State. 
 
What's more, CNN explains , Sanders maintains a solid advantage even if Biden decides not to run: 
 
In most recent national polling, assessments of the Democratic race without Biden have boosted Clinton's standing well above that of Sanders, but in New Hampshire, Biden's backers aren't enough to push Clinton back to the top of the field. Though Clinton picks up more of Biden's supporters than Sanders when they are reallocated to their second choice, Sanders maintains control of the race, holding 49% to Clinton's 36%. 
 
The survey, which was taken between Sept. 17-23 and had a margin of error of +/- 5.5 percent, also asked: ""Regardless of who you are voting for, which candidate do you think is most likely to win the New Hampshire Democratic primary?"" 
 
On that question, Clinton and Sanders are tied at 42 percent, with Clinton's share having decreased drastically and Sanders' increased sharply since July. 
 
The progressive senator's commanding lead is built ""on the strength of his personal appeal and his overall stand on the issues,"" WMUR-9  stated , noting that Sanders enjoys ""overwhelming popularity, with 78 percent viewing him favorably and 11 percent unfavorably.""

India's wholesale price inflation rate crashed to its lowest level ever. 
 
The country's Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rate plunged to -4.9% year-over-year for the month of August — below the consensus expectation of -4.4.% — following July's drop down to -4.1% y/y.  
 
This marks the tenth consecutive month that WPI has been in the negative territory. Additionally, this is the lowest since monthly prices started being tracked in 2005. 
 
""The WPI rate may not have as much of a bearing on policy-making as the CPI rate, but the fact that it has plummeted again is unlikely to be ignored,"" writes Capital Economics' India economist Shilan Shah. ""This strengthens our view that interest rates will be cut at the Reserve Bank of India's policy meeting later this month."" 
 
Furthermore, Shah writes that it doesn't look like things are going to bounce back anytime soon. 
 
""Looking ahead, the WPI rate should remain low by past standards,"" writes Shah. ""There is still evidence of spare capacity in the economy, which should keep a lid on core price pressures ... But we remain sanguine. Other factors that have a role to play in determining local food prices — such as global prices and government stockpiles — should help keep inflation anchored.""

  “Like Traveling from Downtown Dublin to Rural Angola”  
We are thousands of years removed from the origins of the book of Genesis. We live in a world that has sent people to the moon and back, that uses magnets to map the inside of human bodies; we work and sleep in climate controlled buildings, travel in air-conditioned cars, fly in pressurized planes, and send text messages through pieces of metal and glass small enough to slip into the pockets of our pants. The world of Genesis was dusty and barely literate. The people of its time were preoccupied with satiating hunger and securing physical safety. They consulted shamans for toothaches, thought that the gods spoke through birth defects and markings on sheep livers, and they defecated into ditches [see Deuteronomy 23:12 – 14]. Reading Genesis is like traveling from downtown Dublin to rural Angola. The contexts of author and reader could hardly be more different. 
 
To be sure, we don’t share the cultural context of the authors of Genesis but we do hold in common the experience of being human — joy at childbirth and mourning at death. We relish a good story just as much as they did. We have unfulfilled dreams, we take pride in accomplishment, and we experience interpersonal strife, just like they did. At the same time as there are vast differences between us, we share with the biblical writers some of life’s most fundamental elements. How much of this shared experience translates into our understanding of the literary genres that they used? How big are the gaps in our knowledge? 
 
Is Genesis 1 – 11 similar to the genres of our culture? If so, what genre is it? Is it factual history, fictional fable, or somewhere in between? And how does its overall genre affect our interpretation of individual passages? After two thousand years of study, these questions remain a matter of debate. This ebook—adapted from the book Genesis: History, Fiction or Neither?—is intended to reflect this debate as well as to help individuals and congregations have a more informed and focused discussion on the topic. The ebook itself will not arrive at any particular conclusion, although each author advocates for the position that he believes is most beneficial. 
 
In his essay, “Genesis 1 – 11 as History and Theology,” James Hoffmeier argues that the Genesis narrative relates historical facts, real events that happened in space and time. Hoffmeier points to features within Genesis, such as geographical clues and literary elements, that signaled to ancient readers that these stories were to be understood as historical. Gordon Wenham agrees with this to a point. In his essay, “Genesis 1 – 11 as Protohistory,” Wenham sees an undercurrent of history beneath the Genesis account but he likens it to viewing an abstract painting — the picture is there but the details are fuzzy. Wenham believes that Genesis is protohistory, a form of writing that has links to the past but interprets history for the sake of the present. Kenton Sparks explains that the authors of Genesis wrote in typically ancient ways which did not intend to produce history as we know it. In his essay, “Genesis 1 – 11 as Ancient Historiography,” Sparks argues that many of the events recounted in Genesis did not happen as the narrative states. 
 
In the spirit of Galileo, all of the contributors agree that competent interpretation of Scripture requires sensitivity to genre. They disagree, however, over the precise nature of the genre of Genesis 1 – 11 and its implications. To a large extent, competent reading involves getting to know ourselves as much as it does understanding an author. Christopher Wall observes, “Though reading is a close collaboration between a reader and text, it can only start when you notice the difference between what you see and what you want to see.” [“A Curmudgeon’s Guide to Praise.” Posted October 12, 2013.

13,844208,db4ba164-82b4-4bd1-b762-b6ead5cbe378,Harper absolves all but Wright in Duffy affair,News,Salmon Arm Observer,"By The OTTAWA - Stephen Harper says only one member of his staff in the Prime Minister's Office acted irresponsibly or unethically during the Mike Duffy affair.

And the Conservative leader admitted he phoned the one employee he did blame — former chief of staff Nigel Wright — to wish him well last year.

Harper made the comments in a wide-ranging interview with CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge, broadcast Monday night.

Details of the scandal surrounding Sen. Duffy's expenses, and chief of staff Nigel Wright's clandestine repayment of $90,000 of them, monopolized the first stretch of the election campaign.

Duffy's trial is on hiatus until November, but the dramatic testimony of Wright, former PMO lawyer Benjamin Perrin, and former issues manager Chris Woodcock stole the headlines last month.

Emails entered into evidence at Duffy's fraud, breach of trust, and bribery trial show several of Harper's staff were involved in coaching Duffy on media lines, managing the actions of a Senate committee, or aware of the negotiations to repay Duffy's claims.

Mansbridge asked Harper if he at any point went to them and said, ""why didn't you tell me about this?""

Harper responded that some of the facts of the trial were in dispute — most likely referring to the fact that Perrin had testified that Harper's current chief of staff Ray Novak knew of Wright's repayment. Novak has said he did not.

Harper repeated his position that Wright bore the sole responsibility for the matter, as the person directly below him in the PMO.

""There's no person on my staff that I believe deceived me or acted unethically or, or irresponsibly...other than Mr. Wright, yes,"" Harper said.

Harper also revealed that he had telephoned Wright to wish him well on taking his latest executive position with private equity firm Onex Corp.'s London office last summer. A year earlier, he said he felt ""anger, betrayal, disappointment, deception,"" with Wright.

Around the same time in 2014, Wright had been feted at a dinner at the Speaker of the House of Commons residence, attended by other top Conservative figures.

Wright testified that he had been in contact with Novak as recently as a few weeks before his August testimony. Woodcock was seen speaking to a Conservative campaign worker in the corridors of the courthouse.

""Did you get mad at those around you when this happened?"" Mansbridge asked Harper.

""I've been — I've been very upset about it and you know, you ask yourself, what could we do differently in the future,"" Harper responded.

""But you know, look, at some point I would say this. I went through a period where I was very angry. But you've just gotta let that anger go. You have to move on.""

If Harper was ever angry at others in the office, it was never publicly apparent.

Of the figures who were involved in the Duffy affair, most went on to get other senior positions in the Conservative government. Novak is still Harper's chief of staff, and a senior campaign director.

During the rare one-on-one interview, the Conservative party leader repeated several messages he has been delivering on the campaign trail over the last several weeks, particularly that his is the only political party that will steer the economy back to prosperity.

Harper also repeated his stance on military involvement fighting ISIL in the Middle East, saying Canada must be ""in for the long haul,"" and pulling out of the region would add even more displaced persons to the current refugee crisis.

Mansbridge plans to interview the other party leaders in the coming days. The veteran journalist told Harper he plans to ask each politician what makes them, as an individual, a good candidate for prime minister.

Harper's answer largely stuck to his major campaign points, leadership and the economy, but the notoriously closed-off Conservative leader also touched on what leading Canada has meant to him, personally.

""I love the job. It's an honour to serve this country,"" he said.

""I'm hopeful that we'll get another mandate. But if we don't, look, all I say is that it's been an honour to serve. And I think we've done a good job and we can continue doing a good job.""",4159,"By The OTTAWA - Stephen Harper says only one member of his staff in the Prime Minister's Office acted irresponsibly or unethically during the Mike Duffy affair.

Opens New $100 Million Revolving Credit Facility 

Company Website: http://www.sleepnumber.com 

MINNEAPOLIS -- (Business Wire) 

Select Comfort Corporation (NASDAQ: SCSS) (“Sleep Number” or “the company”), the leader in sleep innovation, is acquiring BAM Labs, Inc. (“BAM”) the world’s leading provider of Smart Bed Technology™ solutions and the Silicon Valley-based pioneer of biometric sensor and sleep monitoring for data-driven health and wellness. Select Comfort previously held an equity investment in BAM of approximately 18 percent and is now acquiring the remaining interest for approximately $58 million in cash. 

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150910005853/en/ 

Sleep IQ(R) technology gives consumers the knowledge to adjust for their best sleep. 

Select Comfort knows BAM well, having partnered with the company since 2012 in the development and commercialization of SleepIQ® technology. BAM will operate as an independent business unit called SleepIQ® LABS, which will continue to be based in San Jose, Calif. 

“Together, Sleep Number and SleepIQ LABS will continue to redefine and elevate what consumers can expect from their sleep experience,” said Shelly Ibach, president and chief executive officer of Select Comfort. “This acquisition supports our growth and future financial performance by accelerating innovation at a time when consumers are rapidly adopting new digital tools and using their personal data to improve health and wellness.” 

SleepIQ technology measures each sleeper’s presence, movement and average heart and breathing rates, and analyzes the data with a proprietary algorithm to provide consumers with an individual daily SleepIQ® score and supporting data. Unlike data from other devices, this knowledge is complemented by the ability to make adjustments to the firmness of each person’s side of the bed – their Sleep Number® setting – for optimized sleep. Consumers have quickly adopted SleepIQ technology as part of their daily life and are using this personal data to improve their sleep, and therefore their overall health and wellness. 

Commenting on the merger, Rich Rifredi, co-founder and chief executive officer of BAM said, “We share Sleep Number’s passion for innovation and dedication to its mission to improve lives. Sleep Number will provide extensive consumer expertise and resources as we further develop smart, connected biometric solutions that improve sleep and wellness.” 

“We are very excited to work even more closely with SleepIQ LAB’s team of talented engineers as we continue to innovate with sleep data and insights in support of our mission of improving lives by individualizing sleep experiences,” said Annie Bloomquist, senior vice president and chief product officer of Select Comfort. “This acquisition strengthens our intellectual property and our competitive advantages.” 

Select Comfort also announced today that it has obtained a new $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility, though it does not expect to draw on the facility for the acquisition, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015, subject to customary closing conditions. The acquisition is not expected to be dilutive to the company’s full year 2015 earnings per share (EPS), and is expected to be accretive to EPS within two years. 

Select Comfort is being represented by the Palo Alto, Calif. law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the Minneapolis-based law firm Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly LLP, and is also being advised by Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

""I am very pleased with this result,"" said Chief Executive Tony Gibson today when announcing the annual results for the Council owned company. ""We have delivered another strong dividend for the city and are well positioned for further growth."" 

""There is much about our performance of which Aucklanders can be proud. We have made better than expected progress replacing container volumes after Maersk moved a major service away from Auckland early in our financial year. Container volumes finished the year 0.4% up, against expectations that volumes might fall. 

Our container terminal is the most efficient in Australasia, with record productivity this year. We continue to be New Zealand’s largest container port and a vital part of Auckland’s prosperity. 

""Multi-Cargo volumes have held up well, with car volumes increasing 17.4% to a record 243,801 units. Total breakbulk tonnage (including cars) was up 4.4% on the year before,"" said Gibson. 

""There were several unusual items this year which reduced our reported profit and dividend compared to last year’s record level. $7.3 million has been put aside to cover costs and provisions for the Bledisloe Wharf extensions following the High Court’s decision to over-turn the consents granted by Auckland Council. If the project had certainty, which it no longer has, those costs would not have been expensed. 

""We incurred a $4 million cost related to wharf and building demolition and made $2.4 million in severance payments to workers who left the port after settlement of a collective agreement with the Maritime Union. The result also includes a gain from the revaluation of property of $14.6m."" 

""On a like for like basis, underlying profit was $61.4m compared to $63.4m last year. Costs were impacted by increases in infrastructure repairs and maintenance, Unitary Plan processes and development of future initiatives."" 

""Prospects for the coming year seem subdued, as a result of lower dairy prices and a fall in the New Zealand dollar. We are expecting a softening in some import trades, slower growth in car volumes and a decline in bulk exports."" 

""Long term growth prospects remain strong, in line with Auckland’s growth. As the port on Auckland’s doorstep we are the most direct route into the Auckland market and we expect our volumes to continue to climb. We are making several strategic investments to ensure we can meet that growth. 

""We are investing in a North Island supply chain network, with new freight hubs in the Manawatu and Bay of Plenty, and an expansion of our existing freight hub in South Auckland."" 

""By growing export volumes through the port we will balance the volumes of imports being driven by Auckland’s strong growth and achieve greater supply chain efficiencies. It is a win-win for Auckland and for New Zealand on the global stage. 

As part of this strategy we are actively growing the use of rail to move containers. Rail services increased from 8 per week to 21 and rail volumes are up to over 100,000 TEU a year. The total number of containers (TEU) moved by truck fell by 53,508. 

""To improve productivity and capacity, we are investigating partial automation of our container terminal. We are currently consulting staff and will shortly commission a scoping study. A decision on whether or not to proceed will be made in early 2016."" 

""In October we will finish a 50m wharf extension at Fergusson Container Terminal and start construction of Fergusson North Wharf. These projects increase our terminal berth space by around 50% and are essential for handling growth in both ship size and trade volumes."" 

""Overall, our performance has been good given the challenges we have faced. We have a comprehensive range of initiatives underway that will ensure we continue to deliver strong dividends to the city,"" Tony Gibson concluded.",3936,"Ports of Auckland has declared a $41.7 million dividend for Auckland in the 2015 financial year.

The Irish language forum claimed the change in law was deflecting blame from the gardaí who had made the mistake of not providing bilingual statements in the first place.

The amendment was signed into law by Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe after a loophole emerged that would potentially allow for hundreds of current drink-drive cases to be dismissed because gardaí did not provide statements in both languages as required under road traffic laws.

The replacement 'Statutory Instrument' now stipulates that breath alcohol test statements may be produced in either the English or the Irish language.

""This simple problem that needed to be solved was that this information should have been provided bilingually from the start,"" said general secretary of Conradh na Gaeilge Julian De Spáinn. The Department of Transport said that it had not, in the new SI, opted for bilingual forms as this would have involved recalling the Evidential Breath Test (EBT) machines, which could have taken weeks.

""Had an alternative of a statement in Irish and English been chosen, it would have been necessary to reprogramme all EBT machines across the country,"" said a spokesperson.

""This would have meant taking the apparatus out of service for a period, and losing the facility to use them until reprogrammed.""",1536,"NEW emergency legislation that changes the legal requirement that alcohol breath statements be provided in both English and Irish may be a slippery slope in denying native speakers their language rights, Conradh na Gaeilge has warned.

” 

After taking on medication errors, payment reform and other nettlesome issues embedded in American health care, the Jewish Healthcare Foundation is zeroing in on patients and their role in maintaining their own health. 

“We own it. It’s our health,” said Karen Wolk Feinstein, president and CEO of the foundation, at its Downtown offices Tuesday during a celebration of the foundation’s 25th anniversary. “It’s so fundamental and yet it seems too simple. 

” 

She said she was struck by the idea of keying on people taking responsibility for their own health, by watching what they eat and making sure they exercise and get enough sleep, after traveling internationally to countries whose health systems featured less complex and costly equipment and treatments but had healthier citizens. 

Ms. Feinstein pointed to the importance of focusing on key life stages: habits and behaviors adopted by adolescents, such as smoking, that set them up for major health issues later. Or, at the far end of the age spectrum, making sure the elderly continue to exercise to slow the body’s inevitable decline. 

“It’s a whole lot of things coming together. 

” 

Tuesday’s event came a quarter century after the Jewish Healthcare Foundation of Pittsburgh was formed from the proceeds of the $75 million sale of Montefiore Hospital, considered the local Jewish hospital, to the University of Pittsburgh’s health system. 

In the years since, the foundation has given out $101 million in grants, and taken in $101 million in contributions and other revenue from outside sources, but still has $135 million in the bank, for which Ms. Feinstein credited the foundation’s investment committee. 

But the nonprofit foundation is better known for its research, education, training and grant making, all with the goal of improving health care quality while containing health care costs.

Javier Mascherano has praised the way Lionel Messi handles the pressure of a nation's expectations as Argentina prepare to take on Bolivia in Houston. 
 
Friday's international friendly will be Argentina's first outing since they lost on penalties to Chile in the Copa America final in July. 
 
That defeat, following on from the disappointment of losing to Germany in the World Cup final 12 months earlier, led to Barcelona superstar Messi coming under fire for his inability to lead his national team to a major trophy. 
 
However, Messi has a strong ally in Mascherano, who feels his club-mate copes admirably with life in a goldfish bowl, particularly as he waits to become a father for the second time. 
 
""Messi does not hide and never shies away from criticism,"" the midfielder told TyCSports. 
 
""I would hate to be Messi. He is something very special. He keeps coming [to the national team] even when he is about to be a father. 
 
""We are football players who want to offer the most we can. We are honest and try to do it the best way."" 
 
Mascherano and Messi are both part of Argentina's 24-man squad for the first of two friendlies on American soil in the space of four days. After going up against Bolivia, Gerardo Martino's side head to Dallas to take on Mexico. 
 
Martino is without the services of Angel di Maria, who has been allowed to remain with Paris Saint-Germain to work on his fitness, as well as injured trio Pablo Zabaleta, Javier Pastore and Lucas Biglia. 
 
Atletico Madrid forward Angel Correa, Benfica's Nicolas Gaitan, San Lorenzo defender Emmanuel Mas and River Plate's Matias Kranevitter have been called up to fill the gaps. 
 
Bolivia, meanwhile, will be playing their first game under new coach Julio Cesar Baldivieso. 
 
Mauricio Soria was in charge when the side reached the quarter-finals of the Copa America, but was sacked after falling out with the Bolivian FA. 
 
After a failed attempt to bring back Soria, Baldivies was given the job.

27,835317,2534a043-e585-4148-8f59-b67a73d75b06,"Refugee crisis, money issues in background of 2024 bid race",News,Minneapolis Star Tribune,"LONDON — With the race for the 2024 Olympics now officially underway, the five bid cities face a two-year campaign to convince IOC members that they offer the best project. 
 
The International Olympic Committee announced the official list of candidates Wednesday. As expected, they were: Budapest, Hungary; Hamburg, Germany; Los Angeles, Paris and Rome. 
 
IOC President Thomas Bach described it as a world-class field — something he was determined to get after the debacle for the 2022 Winter Games when only two candidates (Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan) were left following a spate of withdrawals. 
 
Of the five bidders for 2024, Budapest is considered a longshot. Hamburg faces a referendum on Nov. 29 and, even it passes that test, is viewed as an outsider. 
 
That leaves three core candidates in Paris, Rome and Los Angeles. Paris and Los Angeles stand out as the two early front-runners. 
 
The IOC will not cut the field to a short list of finalists this time, meaning all can go to the final vote in Lima, Peru, in September 2017. 
 
Here's a look at some key issues: 
 
___ 
 
BYE-BYE BAKU 
 
A few months ago, seven bid candidates were expected. But Toronto, which hosted the Pan American Games this summer, decided this week not to bid because of uncertainties over the costs. And the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, which looked set to bid after staging the inaugural European Games in June, also stayed out of the race. 
 
Bach said the IOC consulted with Baku about a bid but both sides concluded that 2028 was a more viable target — a decision that should serve Bach politically. 
 
A Baku bid would have presented a headache and image problem for the IOC: A former Soviet republic with an authoritarian leader and a poor human rights record. After being criticized over Sochi and Beijing, Bach and the IOC will be happy to avoid more human rights controversy. 
 
___ 
 
REFUGEE FALLOUT 
 
The 2024 contest involves two countries at the heart of the refugee crisis in Europe: Hungary and Germany. 
 
Budapest's bid will hardly be helped by the international criticism that Hungary and Prime Minister Viktor Orban have faced for their tough stance on migrants. 
 
While the city's bid was being confirmed by the IOC, Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons on hundreds of migrants who broke through a razor wire fence on the border with Serbia. 
 
Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel, meanwhile, have been praised for a more welcoming policy. 
 
""This humanitarian challenge is going beyond Olympic candidatures,"" Bach said in a conference call. ""While we speak, political leaders in Europe and in the world are discussing how to address this great humanitarian challenge. I hope they will come together to a solution ... which allows these refugees to live at home in peace and prosperity."" 
 
___ 
 
DEUTSCHE DOUBLE 
 
Germany is not only bidding for the 2024 Olympics, it is also a strong contender to host the 2024 European soccer championship in the same summer. Previously, the IOC told Turkey it should not bid for both events in 2020. But Bach, who is German, said there is no reason it can't happen in this case. 
 
""This definitely can be possible because time-wise they are couple of weeks apart from each other,"" Bach said. ""I also think nobody has a real doubt about the organizational skills of Germany and German sport in particular."" 
 
___ 
 
FINANCIAL GUARANTEES 
 
One of the stumbling blocks for previous U.S. Olympic bids has been the IOC requirement to provide financial guarantees for any cost overruns. The host city contract can leave taxpayers on the hook for any deficit. The U.S. federal government does not underwrite the cost of the games, as do most other countries. 
 
Bach defended the IOC policy as essential to a level playing field: ""It is just part of a fair competition that the candidate cities are guaranteeing the delivery of the project."" 
 
___ 
 
NO SPENDING CAP 
 
Bach has been pushing for more affordable games, a response in part to the outcry over the $51 billion associated with the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Bach said the IOC had considered, but ultimately ruled out, the idea of imposing a spending cap for 2024 bidding and hosting. 
 
""It is not possible because all the cities are starting from a different starting point,"" he said. ""In one country you already have the infrastructure, in another they are using the games as a catalyst for this infrastructure. We cannot control this and could not enforce a cap.""",4494,"LONDON — With the race for the 2024 Olympics now officially underway, the five bid cities face a two-year campaign to convince IOC members that they offer the best project.

29,106762,08611865-4361-4e27-9a9d-fc6ce9201809,"Micro-parties threaten election war against Coalition, Greens over Senate change",News,Nyngan Observer,"Minor parties have drawn up a war plan to target Coalition and Greens candidates in lower house marginal seats if the Turnbull government proceeds with Senate voting changes. Minor parties have drawn up a war plan to target Coalition and Greens candidates in lower house marginal seats if the Turnbull government proceeds with Senate voting changes. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was forced on Wednesday to hose down talk his government is poised to scrap the Senate preference-swap system – a move that would in effect prevent the election of micro-party senators such as Ricky Muir, who won a seat despite receiving a tiny fraction of the primary vote.

The introduction of a system in which preference deals between parties would be scrapped and voters would instead be allowed to preference a handful of candidates ""above the line"" would likely have to be achieved through a deal between the Coalition and the Greens.

Labor dropped its support for voting reforms earlier this year amid evidence the Coalition would be the big winner if changes are enacted.

Fairfax Media has learnt that the minor party alliance has discussed ways to hit back at the Liberal Party and Greens through an expensive tilt at lower house seats where their influence could hamper the chances of those parties.

Left-wing micro-parties would line up to contest the seat of Melbourne, held by the Greens' only member of the House of Representatives, Adam Bandt, and right-leaning micro-parties would challenge Liberal and candidates in ten marginal seats where there is the best chance of influencing the result.

A list has been drawn up which includes the Victorian seats of La Trobe and Deakin and NSW marginals Barton, Reid and Banks. Teresa Gambaro in Brisbane and Ken Wyatt in the West Australian seat of Hasluck would also be targeted by minor-party candidates.

Graham Askey, a member of the Renewable Energy Party who formerly led preference negotiations for the Hemp Party, confirmed that micro-parties had met to discuss a plan to impede the Greens and the Coalition at the next election.

He said the group wanted to ""put a shot across the bows"" of the parties if they were thinking of moving ahead with changes.

""We can understand why the Coalition would want these reforms because they would be entrenched with the balance of power in the Senate, but we can't understand why the Greens would be supportive,"" he said.

Fairfax Media reported in May that the Greens, while publicly calling for electoral reforms, are split internally on the merits of dumping the preference-swap system. For example, Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young was re-elected due only to minor party preferences.

NSW senator David Leyonhjelm has branded the voting changes being advocated by new Special Minister of State Mal Brough a ""brain fart"" and threatened to go to war with the government in response.

Fairfax Media reported on Tuesday that some crossbenchers had told Mr Turnbull that votes narrowly lost under Tony Abbott and Eric Abetz, who was government leader in the Senate, including the re-establishment of the building industry watchdog and a new body to regulate unions, could be reversed if the relationship between the government and the crossbench improved.

Mr Turnbull, who has rung crossbenchers in a bid to soothe the angst, insisted on Wednesday that there were no specific plans to move reforms before the next election, saying Senator Muir was ""as democratically and constitutionally elected to this place as I am as the member for Wentworth"".

But he did say he understood the concern of some that the system had been ""gamed"" by the micro-parties.
