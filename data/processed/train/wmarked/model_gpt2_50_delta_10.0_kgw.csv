0d00b94d-6066-4a4a-abce-653141a08e14,"EPA asks Volkswagen to recall 482,000 cars over 'defeat devices'",News,TheTurkeyNews.Net,"The Turkey News.Net  Friday 18th September, 2015  
  WASHINGTON/DETROIT - The US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Friday ordered Volkswagen to recall 482,000 cars sold between 2009 and 2015, saying the cars were designed to intentionally mislead smog emissions testing equipment. 
According to the EPA, almost half a million cars were equipped with a device that could detect when it was undergoing an emissions test. And the EPA says that this ""defeat device"" would only run the car at peak efficiency during these times. Which is to say, when the car wasn't being smog-tested, it was polluting a lot more than during the tests. 
 
""Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal and a threat to public health,"" Cynthia Giles of the EPA said in a statement. 
 
""Working closely with the California Air Resources Board, EPA is committed to making sure that all automakers play by the same rules. EPA will continue to investigate these very serious matters."" 
 
The EPA accused the company of breaking the law by installing software known as a ""defeat device"" in 4-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi vehicles from model years 2009-15. 
 
The software was designed to conceal the cars' emissions of the pollutant nitrogen oxide, which contributes to the creation of ozone and smog. The pollutants are linked to a range of health problems, including asthma attacks and other respiratory diseases. 
 
The state of California has issued a separate notice of violation to the company. California, the EPA and the Justice Department are working together on an investigation of the allegations, which cover roughly 482,000 diesel passenger cars sold in the US since 2009. 
 
VW, which owns Audi, faces billions of dollars in fines, although exact amounts were not determined. 
 
The cars, all built in the last seven years, are the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models, as well as the Audi A3. 
 
The German automaker said in a statement it is cooperating with the investigation, but declined further comment. 
 
The EPA said VW faces fines of up to $37,500 per vehicle for the violations a total of more than $18 billion. No final total was announced. 
 
California issued a separate compliance order to VW, and officials announced an investigation by the California Air Resources Board. 
 
The Clean Air Act requires vehicle manufacturers to certify to EPA that their products meet federal air-pollution standards. 
 
EPA said Friday that by making and selling vehicles with the 'defeat device' software, Volkswagen was violating two parts of the Clean Air Act. 
 
Affected diesel models include: Jetta (model years 2009 2015); Beetle (model years 2009 2015); Audi A3 (model years 2009 2015); Golf (model years 2009 2015); Passat (model years 2014-2",446,"The Turkey News.Net Friday 18th September, 2015 WASHINGTON/DETROIT - The US government's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Friday ordered Volkswagen to recall 482,000 cars sold between 2009 and 2015, saying the cars were designed to intentionally mislead smog emissions testing equipment.

Frazier noted it is the first time DCAN has been revised in the eight years of the organization. In 1990, he said rules and regulations for the watershed were first written down. In 1997, a memorandum of agreement between the county and New York City was approved, and then-Chairman Ray Christensen urged his fellow supervisors to complete a plan. In 1999 DCAN was approved and adopted. At that time, the county was charged with having a vision toward clean water, water safety and phosphorous control. Since that time, the county has worked diligently to achieve all three goals, and continues to develop principles and ideals that have helped both county and city. There has always been a core group working with the issues, but Frazier said there have been multiple other agencies working, advising and contributing along the way.

Politicians in marginal seats, particularly in regional areas, could win votes by boosting funding to the ABC, new polling suggests. 

Fifty-nine per cent of Australians support extra funding for ABC regional news services, with just 9 per cent opposed, the polling from the progressive Australia Institute shows. Support rises to 64 per cent in remote areas. 

A majority of voters also support extra funding for programs about regional Australia. 

Support for the ABC was strong in deputy Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce's seat of New England, where 64 per cent of voters are in favour of targeted funding for regional news. This includes 52 per cent of Nationals voters. 

Former Independent MP Tony Windsor, who is considering running against Mr Joyce at the next federal election, launched the report, Heartland: Why the bush needs its ABC , at Parliament House on Wednesday. 

""The worst thing that can happen is that all media comes out of Sydney,"" Mr Windsor said. 

""Irrespective of whether people live in the country or the city they trust the ABC, particularly in the country."" 

The Abbott government cut ABC funding by $254 million over five years last year. 

The polling also shows voters strongly support extra ABC funding in the ""bellwether"" seat of Eden Monaro and Education Minister Christopher Pyne's seat of Sturt. 

Sixty-five per cent of Sturt voters, including 57 per cent of Liberal voters, support expanded regional news services, a figure matched in Eden Monaro. 

The online survey of 1413 people was conducted in March. 

Mr Windsor said the financial difficulties facing commercial television stations in regional areas and regional newspapers made a well-funded ABC more important than ever. 

Since 2010, WIN has closed its bureaus in Albany, Geraldton and Broome while Prime has shut its studios in Tamworth, Orange and Wagga Wagga. 

Mr Windsor said he supports a campaign by regional broadcasters, fronted by former Nationals leader Tim Fischer, to abolish restrictions on media ownership, especially the 75 per cent ""reach rule"" that restricts the creation of national networks. 

Australia Institute executive director Ben Oquist said: ""The ABC has been a controversial topic of late but what is not controversial is the level of support for the ABC in the bush. 

""While the political class has been cutting the ABC, this report shows an appetite for increased funding for the ABC, particularly if it is directed at regional news services."" 

While the polling showed strong overall support for the ABC, there were significant differences based on location and political preference. 

Only 26 per cent of Liberal voters in Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull's inner-city seat of Wentworth support extra funding for ABC regional news, for example.

12197824-12cc-4cb0-b47b-e8d52a6cc385,Western Potash Closes Strategic Investment From Beijing Tairui Innovation Capital Management Ltd.,News,Virtualization Conference & Expo,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/16/15 -- Western Potash Corp. (""Western"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: WPX)(FRANKFURT: AHE) is pleased to announce the closing of the previously announced strategic investment from Beijing Tairui Innovation Capital Management Ltd. (""Tairui""), whereby Tairui has purchased 238,264,635 common shares of Western (""Common Shares"") at a price of $0.3358 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $80 million (the ""Transaction""). In conjunction with the Transaction, CBC (Canada) Holding Corp. (""CBCHC"") has purchased 2,144,865 Common Shares also at $0.3358 per share, pursuant to the exercise of its pre-emptive anti-dilution right with the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $720,245.67. CBCHC made an initial investment in the Company in 2013 in the amount of approximately $32 million. 

Following completion of the Transaction, including the issuance of Common Shares to CBCHC under its pre-emptive right, Tairui holds a 51% ownership stake, and CBCHC holds a 10.1% ownership stake, in Western on a non-diluted basis. All securities issued in connection with the Transaction to Tairui and CBCHC are subject to a four month hold period in accordance with Canadian securities laws. On closing of the Transaction, the Company has 467,185,559 issued and outstanding Common Shares. 

The per share issue price of $0.3358 represents an approximate 53% premium over the volume-weighted average price of the Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange for the 30 trading days ended July 3, 2015, the last trading day prior to the initial public announcement of the Transaction. 

Tairui is a China based private equity investment company with a focus on the energy and mining industries. The management team has extensive experience in project management and investment management in the natural resource sector. 

Highlights of the Transaction 

The Transaction provides Western with a significant capital infusion that will enable the Company to advance its current business plan to develop the pilot plant on the Milestone Project (the ""Pilot Plant""), as announced and described in the Company's news release dated July 2, 2015. Operational demonstration of the Pilot Plant would provide the longer-term opportunity for Western to further develop its high quality and significant potash resources in Saskatchewan with financially and technically strong strategic partners in Tairui and CBCHC. 

The highlights and benefits of the Transaction include: 

-- equity financing for advancement of Western's Pilot Plant on the Milestone Project at a significant premium to currently depressed market prices for Western's Common Shares; -- a strategic alliance that will provide Western with access to project financing, technical expertise in large scale project construction, and management and marketing channels for future potash sales; and -- a continuing opportunity for holders of Western's Common Shares to participate in the future advancement of the Milestone Project. 

Approval of the Transaction was received at a Special General Meeting of the Company's shareholders held on August 24, 2015. As outlined in the Management Information Circular dated July 24, 2015, Deloitte Corporate Finance Inc. provided an opinion to the Board of Directors of Western to the effect that, as of the date of, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications contained in, the opinion, the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to Western shareholders. 

""The greatest challenge to the Milestone Project has always been financing risk,"" said Pat Varas, Western's President & CEO. ""Today's transaction represents a major step in risk reduction. Western has been actively canvassing the globe for a strategic partner with the financial strength to help us execute on the Pilot Plant. We believe that Tairui is an ideal partner. We believe that this strategic investment provides our shareholders with much greater value than an outright sale of the project or a dilutive standalone public financing would in the current depressed markets. The Transaction represents an opportunity not afforded to the shareholders of many junior companies at the moment."" 

""Since the signing of the term sheet 11 months ago, we have had the opportunity to broaden our knowledge of the Milestone Project,"" said Bill Xue, President of Tairui. ""In fact, the scoping study results delivered in July of this year provide for a scalable and more flexible approach to the project. At Tairui, we look to invest in advanced projects with a large resource base and without environmental complications. The scalability we see in the scoping study is attractive from a cost and project timeline perspective and renders the project relatively more competitive. The Western Potash team is highly skilled, committed and passionate. In combining the resources of Tairui with the high quality Milestone Project and an innovative development process, we are excited about the future prospects for Western.""

Uber has faced many protests over its ride-hailing app, but this time the protests came directly to the CEO. 

During a taping of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Uber's CEO, Travis Kalanick, was interrupted by at least one protester in the upper balcony, according to several Business Insider reporters who were there and witnessed it. 
 
The first time, the protester stood up during the taping and accused Kalanick of destroying taxi-industry jobs. Colbert let the protester speak for awhile, before saying that he had a question about that in his cue cards anyway. 
 
Kalanick maintained that Uber pays better and offers more flexible hours than the taxi industry, an oft-repeated stance by the company. 
 
  
At Colbert, audience member started protesting the Uber CEO. Amazing how Colbert just let him speak. 
— Rachel Zarrell  (@rachelzarrell) September 10, 2015    
Later, after Colbert did ask about ""disruption"" and potential negatives to Uber's business model, someone started yelling again and claimed that everything Kalanick was saying was a lie. 
 
Colbert apologized for his audience in the end, saying that there was a lot of ""passion"" around the issue in New York City. Because an emotional interview with US Vice President Joe Biden ran long, it's unclear if the interview with Kalanick will run tonight as scheduled. 
 
Business Insider reached out to Uber and CBS and will update this story if we hear back.

5da5face-e542-4b91-a408-e72983b201b6,High school football: Montini riding high with three straight quality wins,News,MySuburbanLife.com,"LOMBARD – Few football teams have played three games as difficult as Montini has so far, and the Broncos won all three. 
   
Coach Chris Andriano called it a feather in the cap of the program to pick up victories against Maine South, East St. Louis and St. Rita to start the season. The Broncos’ latest victim was St. Rita. Montini beat the Mustangs 38-7 on Sept. 11. 

“It just gives us confidence,” running back Prince Walker said. “We already knew from the beginning of the season that we could do it. 

“There’s less pressure to make it to the playoffs [now], but we knew we could do it.” 

Walker rushed for a touchdown to bring his season total to four. Dylan Maher caught a touchdown pass from quarterback Justin Blake and Will Smith had a long rushing score in the fourth quarter, but the story of the game was Montini’s defense. 

The Broncos forced four turnovers to bring their season total to 12. Two of those turnovers turned into touchdowns. Jake Kapp returned a fumble for a touchdown and Reed Taylor had a pick-six. 

“I think we’re just good as a team,” senior defensive lineman Brandon Andino said of the defense. “Our speed is definitely killer this year player to player. It’s a whole different type of speed now and it helps out on turnovers.” 

Montini’s winning start is impressive, but maybe even more so considering last year’s team went 1-2 against the same teams and still made it to the Class 5A championship game. 

“We always strive to beat everybody,” Walker said. “From last year we had a chip on our shoulder so we had to beat them.” 

Now the Broncos enter conference play in the Chicago Catholic League Green. Montini opens against De La Salle, which already has picked up a conference win against Fenwick in Week 3. 

“We’re battle tested now so it’s time to just play ball,” Andino said.

6cd7587e-2e1f-4135-a88f-b1b5d7cfed23,J.K. Rowling reveals the correct way to pronounce 'Voldemort',News,Moree Champion,"Maybe he must not be named because no one says his name right? 

He is the wizard so evil he is known as ""He Who Must Not Be Named"", but it seems there is another reason why the witches and wizards of Hogwarts shouldn't try to say Voldemort's name: they are probably saying it incorrectly.

In a tweet on Wednesday, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling announced that the villain of her story should be pronounced with a silent ""t"".

Responding to a fan's assertion that she had said in the past that Voldemort's name was pronounced in such a manner, Rowling, 50, confirmed the fan had remembered correctly.

""But I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who pronounced it that way,"" the British author added. 

... but I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who pronounces it that way. https://t.co/HxhJ5XY5HP— J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) September 9, 2015

In this sense, Voldemort takes his linguistic cues from United States comedian Stephen Colbert, or camembert cheese.

The pronunciation seems logical given Voldemort's name closely resembles the French ""vol de mort"" (""theft of death"") in which the ""t"" is silent.

His name has been widely speculated as a reference to the character's evasion of death by splitting his soul into various pieces and hiding them across the wizarding world.

However, Rowling can't really blame her fans for messing up their pronunciation of the Dark Lord's moniker.

In the film adaptation of Rowling's bestselling books and in series' audiobooks (narrated by Stephen Fry), Voldemort's name is distinctly pronounced with a hard ""t"".

J. K. Rowling has been increasingly active on Twitter this year, sharing various tidbits about Harry Potter's world with the books' fans.

The story first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",306,"Maybe he must not be named because no one says his name right?

By Brandon Katz | Sep 04, 2015 10:31 AM EDT 
    
Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones set for big fantasy football season? (Photo : ) 
    
The Atlanta Falcons have struggled through back-to-back losing seasons that cost former head coach Mike Smith his job and ""earned"" general manager Thomas Dimitroff a demotion. Yet despite the negativity that has surrounded the team of late, there are some rays of hope. Mainly, quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones are still present. 

 
Not only are they present, but ESPN Senior Fantasy writer Matthew Berry believes the latter is headed for a monster season. Berry writes in his bold predictions column that Jones will have a career year in 2015. That's really saying something considering he's coming off a season in which he posted more than 1,500 receiving yards. 

 
""I say Julio Jones has the best fantasy football season for a wide receiver in the history of the NFL. My thinking: Well, I wanted to do a bold prediction for the guy I already have ranked No. 3 among wideouts, so there you go. But with no run game to speak of and a defense that should struggle, Atlanta should be throwing early and often. Playing the ""X"" in Kyle Shanahan's offense, there's a very good chance Jones leads the NFL in targets, and with Matt Ryan as his QB, a very good chance he catches most of them."" 

 
It's true that Atlanta's running game was virtually non-existent last season. The Falcons finished the year ranked 24 th in rushing yards per game (93.6) and 20 th in yards-per-carry (4.0). However, the addition of third-round running back Tevin Coleman and a full and healthy season from second-year left tackle Jake Matthews should provide a boost in that area. And even with the addition of head coach Dan Quinn and rookie pass-rusher Vic Beasley, this defensive unit does not project to be even middle of the pack in 2015. 

 
Regardless of the situation, Jones is capable of producing a historic season. As previously mentioned, Jones posted 1,593 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 104 receptions last year. His only issue since entering the league in 2011 has been injuries. He's missed a total of 15 games throughout his four seasons. 

 
Jones received a massive five-year, $71.25 million contract extension last weekend, freeing him up to focus on football this year. If healthy, watch out.

It seems almost impossible though now too new it is not who most remember Mr. Shanahan said last June discussing player evaluations - whether/not players would choose among trade positions available just six years old considering he'd already played 225 passes against them prior taking place well under OJ Howard four decades later • Michael Lewis Will End Up Turning 30 In Four Months ; Tim Brown Shares Three Amazing Facts about Joe Haden Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Greg McElruys helped solve one common flaw", Analyst Tony La Russa gave an analysis comparing New Orleans' game plan during Super Bowl XLIII by projecting teams based on their Week 9 rankings from previous weeks over which different quarterbacks would be used to prepare themselves as well in any given year like this one...The league's sixth divisional playoff position is actually quite even with Seattle since it hasn't yet been won or lost against other NFC East squads until now.. Last Saturday night was just another chance at home again after all those years past when Aaron Rodgers had four interceptions vs Pittsburgh last Sunday....I've said before what really matters today; you should never buy into anything above 50% probability if your best bet involves playing better than 33%. For them to make such drastic changes while keeping things so close isn´t necessarily very impressive though I can imagine many donating more points every week without needing stats coming out.....Also according To get 30+ NFL games starting righty versus 31 yrs old he will end up being 23th among tight ends running backs

In a twist not written by producers, Sam Wood had a crisis of conscience during the rose ceremony. 
 
The Melbourne fitness company owner began sweating as he deliberated giving away his last two roses and excused himself to speak with host Osher Gunsberg. 
 
""Tonight the seriousness of the whole situation has just dawned on me,"" he said. 
 
""I've got three girls up there and two roses and one of them (Rachel) I've hardly spent any time with.""

""This whole thing moves so fast,"" Wood said. 
 
""I'm making decisions all of the time, there's girls going all the time and amidst it all I'm trying to find love. 
 
""I guess I want to be fair to the girls."" 
 
The show's producers agreed to let Wood give all six women a rose, avoiding an elimination.

The 27-year-old went on a single date with the Bachelor, who admitted he was strongly attracted to her ""girl next door"" looks and personality. 
 
""She's come out of nowhere a week ago…. It really has knocked me sideways and made me think about where my heart is at,"" he said.

b1101b73-0179-442f-9a73-135a302f8682,How to Convert your TIG Torch to a Gas Lens,Blog,Eastwood Blog- Featuring 'Shop Talk' with Kevin Tetz,"In the quest for perfectly colored stack of dimes TIG welds there are a few ways you can give yourself an advantage. Two of them are to get optimal gas coverage and the ability to see the weld puddle better. Gas lens kits do just that. The design of the gas lens allows for more efficient gas coverage and lets you stick the tungsten electrode out from the cup further giving you better visibility when welding. We decided to show you how quick and easy it is to convert your torch over to one of these kits below. Above you can see the basic layout of the traditional torch parts and the gas lens parts are pretty similar. Some of the parts can be reused on your torch while some are specific to the gas lens kit. Start by loosening the back cap and removing the front cup and electrode. You can then remove the collet from the back of the torch. You can then remove the collet body from the front and set the collet body and nozzle to the side. In our gas lens kit pictured above we do include extra collets but you can also reuse your existing one if it is in good shape. Here you can see the inner workings of the gas lens and why it's better and different than the traditional torch parts. The gas lens has a wire mesh screen that ""fogs"" the shielding gas out of the torch and gives more coverage over the weld puddle.The collet body houses this screened portion and is larger in diameter than the traditional collets. Start by putting the gas lens insulator into the torch so it fits inside of the existing insulator. This allows the larger gas nozzle to seal onto the torch to avoid a shielding gas leak. You can then thread the collet body into the front of the torch to keep the insulator on the torch. The nozzle will compress it tightly onto the torch once tight. You can then load the backside of the torch with the collet and the tungsten electrode. Finally set your electrode stick-out and tighten your back cap until it is snug and the electrode is firmly held in position. You now have a fully converted gas lens setup on your TIG torch and you're ready to step up your welding game!",396,In the quest for perfectly colored stack of dimes TIG welds there are a few ways you can give yourself an advantage.

f1cfd14e-6307-4e8c-ba56-dddf32b5b1cb,An Exemplary Reception (1 Thessalonians 2:13-16),Blog,Park Baptist Church,"            How do you view the Bible? What place does the Bible hold in your life? It may be easy rattle off how important the Bible is, but what do your actual day to day activities reveal about your view of the Bible? Stop and really think about that question. A recent study commissioned by the American Bible Society reveals some interesting facts regarding how our society views the Bible[1]. The percentage of people who are skeptical of the Bible has doubled in the last three years. And of those who are skeptical of the Bible, 2/3 of them are under the age of 48. Of the Millennials, ages 18-29, surveyed nearly 40 % say they have never read the Bible. And even though skepticism of the Scriptures is on the rise, almost 80% still hold a favorable view of the Bible with almost 90% of homes owning a Bible. The average household owns more than 4 Bibles, but only 37% of Americans read the Bible more than once a week.             An interesting fact revealed in the survey that 62% of people surveyed want to read the Bible more, but admit that busyness with job, family, and activities continue to squeeze out their Bible reading. People are also finding communion with God outside of the Bible. Only 56% of those surveyed say that reading the Bible draws them closer to God. And only 30% of Millennials believe the Bible has too little influence in society. If you were surveyed and were honest, what would your answers reveal about your view of the Bible?             One of the most important marks of an exemplary church is how people receive the Bible. And I am not only considering what a church says they believe about the Bible, but what they actually believe about the Bible. There are many churches that would attest to a high view of Scripture, but in analyzing their practices the Bible may actually play a small part of their congregational life. As a pastor, I am constantly praying that the Word of God is more cherished and more loved by our congregation. All Christians should cherish and delight in God’s Word. If we are going to grow as an exemplary church, then we must grow in our knowledge and love of God’s Word.             The Thessalonians were praised because of how they received the Word. 1 Thessalonians 2:13, “And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the Word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as what it really is, the Word of God, which is at work in you believers.” The Thessalonians were defined in how they received the Word of God. Beloved, we will be defined in how we receive the Word so I pray that we will receive the Word as what it really is, the Word of God. Receive the Word as the Word of God             It would be beneficial for us to establish what we mean by the Word of God. There may be those who say they believe the Word of God, but may not believe the Word like the Thessalonians believed and like we are called to believe the Word. We are to receive the Word of God as True In developing our doctrine of Scripture, we begin with 2 Timothy 3:16-17, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.” There is much that can be cleaned from this verse, but I only want to establish that Scripture comes from God. If Scripture comes from God then it must be true.  Romans 3:4b, “Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, “That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged.” Paul begins his letter Titus affirming the truthfulness of God’s Word by connecting it to God’s Character. “Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior; (Titus 1:1-3). If God is true then God’s Word is true and therefore it is trustworthy. We are to receive the Word of God as Perfect             Psalm 19:7-9, “The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.” We can trust the Bible because it is true and it is perfect. The first article of the Baptist Faith & Message 2000 begins this way, “The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter.” We cannot waver on the perfection of the Bible. This does not mean that every translation is perfect. The Bible was written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic. Our English Bibles are mere translations. The Autograph, or the Original Manuscript, does not exist, but that does not mean we cannot trust the Bibles we hold in our hands. We can and we should. We should believe that even when we encounter things that are difficult and/or apparent contradictions that after all the facts are on the table the Bible will be perfect. J.I. Packer notes, ““One cannot doubt the Bible far-reaching loss, both of fullness of truth and of fullness of life. If therefore we have at heart spiritual renewal for society, for churches and for our own lives, we shall make much of the entire trustworthiness—that is, the inerrancy—of Holy Scripture as the inspired and liberating Word of God.[2] We are to receive the Word of God as Authoritative             We receive the Word of God as true and perfect and therefore we receive the Word as the supreme authority in our lives. The Bible is the final standard on which all opinions and behavior should be tried. Different churches place the final authority in different places. The Catholic Church places Scripture and Church Tradition at the same level. Liberal Protestant churches place Scripture and Human Reason at the same level. Conservative and Historic Christian churches place Scripture above all other authorities. Much of the division in the church is the result of how each church or denomination handles the Word of God. Conservative churches may disagree on interpretations, but we are all working off the same standard.             God speaks, we listen. God speaks, we obey. Sadly, many churches claim that Bible is the main authority in their church life, but their practical decisions are governed by pragmatic concerns. The question we should be constantly asking is, “What does the Bible say?” I know many bible-believing Baptist Churches that place tradition over Scripture. Remember the Bible is God’s Word. To ask, “What does the Bible say?” is to ask, “What does our Lord and Savior say?”             Pastors have been commissioned by God to declare His Word to His people. Titus 2:15, “Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.” Beloved, do you delight in God’s authority? The fall of humanity began with four little words, “Did God actually say…?” Rejecting God’s authoritative Word will bring nothing but pain and destruction in your life and the lives of those you love. We are to receive the Word of God as Sufficient             We all may want to say that the Bible is sufficient, but there have probably been times when we wanted a little more revelation from God. Listen to how Pastor Kevin DeYoung helps us diagnose our view of sufficiency, Have you ever wondered if the Bible is really able to help you with your deepest problems? Have you struggled to know what to do with your life, and wished you had some special word from the Lord? Have you ever thought to yourself that the biblical teaching on sexuality needs updating? Have you ever wished for a more direct, more personal revelation than what you get from slowly reading through the Bible? Have you ever secretly wanted to add something to the word of God—you know, just to make things safer? Have you ever wanted to take something away to make the Bible more palatable? Have you ever assumed that the Bible doesn’t say anything about how to worship God or how to order his church? Have you ever felt like the Bible just wasn’t enough for living a faithful life in today’s world? If you can answer yes to any of these questions—and we all will at times—then you are struggling with the sufficiency of Scripture. The Bible is sufficient as it is for all of life. Even the verse I quoted above, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.” The Bible is relevant and contains all that we need for life and godliness.             There is a growing movement of people desiring to hear a special revelation from God.  Many Christians put more stock in movies like Heaven is for Real and 90 minutes in Heaven than the book of Revelation. If you want a special word from God, read your Bible. I mean that with all seriousness. God’s word is sufficient for all. Do not look for a “special” word from God, but rather look to the “special” Word from God. We are to receive the Word of God as Good             A regular argument put forth in our culture is that the Bible is outdated. The common refrain repeated again and again is, “We are modern people and need to adopt modern views on life and sexuality.” It may sound sophisticated, but it is masking an attack on the goodness of God’s Word and the goodness of the God who gave the Word. People have denied sin and believe that God is withholding something good from them in telling them no. The argument is not new, for the same tactic was used in the Garden of Eden when, “the serpent said to the woman, ‘You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’ (Genesis 3:4-5) Satan wanted Eve to believe that God was withholding something good from her, attacking the goodness of God’s Word. We are so easily tempted to doubt God’s goodness.             The God’s Word is not withholding anything from us, but protecting us for God knows what is best for us. Listen to the voices of those who speak against God’s Word and notice the undercurrent of pride. They doubt the goodness of the Word, because they believe they know better way. We must hold fast to the goodness of God’s Word. We are to receive the Word of God as Active             The Word of God is powerful. It is powerful to save and it is powerful to sanctify. At the end of 1 Thessalonians 2:13 Paul adds a profound encouragement, “which is at work in you believers.” For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. (Hebrews 4:12) God’s Word changes us. God is actively working on us through His Word by His Spirit.             Do you ever feel stagnate in your Christian walk? Or maybe you have felt discouraged with particular sin struggle? Beloved, know that God’s Word is actively working in your life. There is a real, profound affect that happens to us when we read and meditate on the Word of God. We cannot comprehend the immediate and long term benefits that come from the Word. Psalm 1:1-3, “Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers.” The delight and meditation on God’s Word leads to prosperity and fruitful labor.               We do not fully understand or appreciate the importance of the Word of God for if we did we would make every effort to hear, read and meditate on it. The number one stated reason people don’t read the Bible is busyness.[3] The unstated reason is that we do not believe in its power in our lives. When you commit to a new activity how often do you ask the question, “How will this affect my or our family’s Bible intake?” God’s Word is life-changing and powerful. It actively changes us. It takes our eyes off of ourselves and fixes them on God’s glory. What in your life hinders you from reading the Word? We are to receive the Word as Christ-Exalting                         Under-girding our entire doctrine of Scripture is the motivation to exalt the living Christ. We live to make much of Jesus Christ. We proclaim Him. We desire to grow up into full maturity to be like Christ. When we receive and obey the Word, we make much of Jesus who has given us His Word. Jesus said, If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. (John 15:7-11) When we receive the Word of God, we receive Jesus. To deny the Word is to deny the Savior.                       We must receive the Word of God as what it really is: the Word of God. For if we do not receive the Word as the very living words of Almighty God we will not be ready for the trials that may be coming. Receive the Word as Worthy of Trials             Persecution comes in many ways. It may come with a raise of an eyebrow from your college professor, whispers from colleagues, denial of promotion at work, outright scorn and ridicule by a family member, jail time, or even death. Are you ready to receive the Word as worthy enough to hold on to regardless of what comes? The Thessalonians were. 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16, For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last! The Thessalonians faced physical persecution from their own countrymen. Those who were once their friends and family became their persecutors. And in the face of persecution, they remained steadfast because they had received the Word of God as the Word of God which was worthy of trials.              If the Bible is God’s Word then we must stand on it. And the best way we stand is to trust and obey God’s Word. We make reading God’s Word primary in our lives. We make the hearing of God’s Word primary in our lives. We make obeying God’s Word primary in our lives. An exemplary church delights in the Word and will stand in the face of persecution. Jesus shows us how of the word is sown on the soils of different hearts, And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. Beloved, persecution and tribulation will come more and more to Christians in America. The question is, “Will you endure?” The only way you will endure is if you count the Word of God as worthy of the trials they bring. Receive the Word as a Witness of War             We are in a war. We battle with the spiritual forces of darkness every day. And the battle is from without and within. First, it is clear from the text that there is a battle from outside the faith for those who oppose the message of the gospel. People want to silence Christians because the message of the gospel is the power of God for salvation. There is an active opposition to the gospel by real people, but our battle is not against them. Ephesians 6:10-12, Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. When people oppose the gospel, they are under the influence of the evil one captured to do his will. Satan is a deceiver. He opposes all mankind by hindering people from hearing the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. He may do it through national laws and company policies, but his aim is to hide the gospel remedy for the cancer of sin.             The gospel of Jesus Christ is the only hope for our world. We all have sin and need a Savior. Jesus Christ lived and died to destroy the works of the devil. The Word became flesh and dwelt among us to reverse the curse of sin and give us hope for eternal life. Faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is man’s only hope before God. Therefore to oppose the gospel is to oppose all mankind for it is our only hope. Do you know this hope? Do you believe in this hope with all your heart?             Those who oppose the gospel will one day bow. The text seems to imply that the Jews were facing some real life trouble. We do not know exactly what their trouble was, but Paul knew their trouble came from their opposition to the truth. The Word is a witness to the war of this world. There are those who work for the gospel and those who work against the gospel. The challenge is that there are things in our own heart that wage war against our soul. Peter writes, “Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.” (1 Peter 2:11) One of the passions of the flesh that wage war against our soul is the desire for the acceptance of the world. The battle rages every time you have the opportunity to share the gospel. How many times have we had the opportunity to share our faith only to let fear of judgment or awkwardness allow the opportunity to pass? Do not let the love of the world and the acceptance of those who stand opposed to God hinder you from sharing the gospel that others may be saved. Let us speak not to please man but to please God who tests our hearts.             Last year a missionary captured a video of Chinese believers receiving the Bible for the first time. As they were handed the Bible, they brought the bibles to their faces and wept. One of the Chinese believers said, “Thanks be to God, we need this book so much. When I see this book, I think of the brothers and sisters who have helped us and brought this to us with their blood and spirit. This is what our church needs so much right now.” Beloved, this book is what our church needs so much right now. Will we receive this Word as it really is, the Word of God?

When I first started as an angel investor I was excited to start investing in startups - but I didn't know much,"" says Gil Penchina, who now heads the highest-value syndicate on AngelList with more than $6 million (£4m) of backing. ""I couldn't tell the good ones from the bad, I didn't understand all these venture capital terms, so I  would invest somewhat blindly."" So, why go it alone? With a syndicate, you can invest alongside people with experience, better connections and access to deal flow - a higher rate of business transactions. 

""If you have the deal flow as an individual then that's great,"" says Nancy Fechnay, who heads Penchina's first UK syndicate, Flight.vc UK, alongside him. ""But usually, people can't possibly see every great deal that's in the market all by themselves."" Most syndicates have hundreds of thousands of dollars in backing, from anywhere between two and a few hundred backers - depending on their minimum-investment requirement. By joining a syndicate, investors can also invest sizably less than they would need to as an individual investor. So, if you're interested in making startup investments, but don't want to gamble as much money, here's how to get a piece of the action. 
Get accredited 
AngelList allows international investors to back American syndicates. Backers must meet American standards and either have a net worth of $1 million or have earned $200,000 in each of the previous two years. ""We ask investors to meet the accreditation standards because tech startups are not right for everyone,"" says Philipp Moehring, director of AngelList UK. ""We want them to be aware they can lose money too, because that's what startup investing is like."" 
Find a syndicate 
There are hundreds of syndicates, so don't be hasty. ""Look at the syndicate leads, their connections, what deals they've done before,"" advises Fechnay. ""And check what resources they have at their disposal, so they're getting the best deals and also providing their companies with support."" You can pick a syndicate dedicated to a certain area - from Bitcoin to the UK. ""You're looking for someone with a thesis that matches yours,"" says Penchina. 
Research the leads 
Leads are not limited to serial investors. They range from venture capitalists like Jenny Rooke (£325,000) to Stanford law professors such as Jeff Schox (£82,000). Many are entrepreneurs: Wayne Chang, whose startup Crashlytics had angel funding before being acquired by Twitter, raised £623,000. The majority don't invest often but some are active. Jason Calacanis' and the FG Angels syndicates have, since 2014, made 11 and 33 investments respectively.  
Get in on the action 
Once they've been accepted, backers are notified each time the lead investor syndicates a deal. They can choose to opt out if they don't wish to convert their backing into a reservation - an indication that the investor wants to invest. When enough reservations are confirmed, the investors will be invited to close. Converting a backing to a reservation is non-binding, but pulling out of a deal often may result in the lead removing them from the syndicate. 
Know the risks 
The companies backers invest in are just starting out; they are usually run by young teams and will have to overcome many challenges. ""Investing in this asset class is quite risky,"" says Penchina. ""Angel investments have a high likelihood of failure."" Because of this, backers should consider how much they could afford to lose and be cautious. Penchina's advice: ""Limit your exposure to five per cent of your portfolio, or a similar small amount."" 
Understand the deal 
When the lead investor syndicates a deal, they will provide a rationale for the investment, and will disclose any potential conflicts of interest. Only 99 accredited investors can invest in a syndicated deal at one time. This does not mean a syndicate cannot house more than 99 backers, but it means some may miss out if they do not act quickly. ""It typically takes five days to opt in or opt out,"" says Penchina. ""Although on some of the hot ones it can go faster than that."" 
  Don't miss   Remember the carry fee 
Because a syndicate allows investors to co-invest with other notable investors, they pay the lead investor a ""carry"" fee. This means the lead investor will earn an extra percentage of any profit for their involvement. The carry fee is similar to a performance fee, as it is assumed that the experience they bring will enhance the deal - though there is no guarantee that lead investors are experts here. A five per cent carry fee is also paid to AngelList. 
Close the deal 
 Backers don't sign the financing documents; instead, they sign documents to invest in a nominee structure or LLC fund, which is managed by the lead investor. The fund is created solely for the purpose of investing in the company (this is done so that the startup only has to deal with one fund, rather than with excessive amounts of investors). Then the investors are invited to close, which means signing the documents and wiring the capital to the fund. 
Make a profit (hopefully) 
The syndicate lead will advise the backers when to sell shares. Syndicate deals also have pro rata rights - if you buy a stake in a company and it releases another round of shares, you are given the option of buying more to maintain your ownership percentage. ""Investors like me value it because it's essentially a free chance to buy more stock in good companies,"" says Penchina. ""And because you get the same terms I get, you get the benefit of me negotiating for you.""

4347fbe3-fdd1-4b1b-977a-ee2fa07858c3,Four Australians on drug smuggling charges granted bail in Hong Kong court,News,ABC Online,"A Melbourne pensioner, a brain-damaged Western Australian mine worker and two other Australians who all claim they were duped into smuggling millions of dollars in drugs bound for Australia have been granted bail in a landmark Hong Kong court ruling. 

The Australians, aged between 49 and 82, are among nine Westerners whose cases were uncovered by the ABC's 7.30 program earlier this year and who have been locked up in Hong Kong for as long as 15 months on drug smuggling charges that could see them imprisoned for the rest of their lives. 

All nine alleged drug smugglers claim to have been lured by a West African crime syndicate which grooms vulnerable people online into taking an all-expenses-paid trip to Hong Kong on the lure of a financial deal, a romance, an inheritance or a humanitarian project. 

Once in Hong Kong, victims claim they were handed luggage to take to Australia which they did not know contained the drug ice, hidden in the lining or in items inside. 

Along with a tenth courier, the group of unlikely drug smugglers were caught at Hong Kong airport with a total of $36 million worth of the drug ice, weighing 29.5 kilograms, as they set off for Australia and New Zealand between April 2014 and March 2015. 
   
The fact that in every single instance it involved ice, I hate to think of the harm and damage it would have caused to the young in Australia [and] New Zealand. 
 
      Judge Kevin Zervos   
Scores of others targeted by such syndicates have been arrested in Australia and in countries where they face the death penalty, including China and Malaysia. 

Many of them are frail, elderly, brain-damaged, mentally ill or juvenile. 

Last month 7.30 revealed the Australian Government and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had made a series of high-level representations to China this year, troubled by the evidence the Australians detained there were duped or coerced into smuggling drugs. 

In the Hong Kong High Court this afternoon, bail was granted to eight of the nine co-accused, including four Australians: 49-year-old WA mine worker Kent Walsh, who suffered serious brain injuries in a car crash six years ago; Darwin warehouse worker James Clifford, 62; Melbourne woman Suong Thu Luu, 44; and 82-year-old Melbourne pensioner Joerg Ulitzka, an Australian resident and a German citizen. 

Also granted bail were Americans Bove Celia Gertrude Eberhard, 67, William Leon Moorman, 47, and Mark William Un, 55, as well as Brendan John Toner, 62, from the UK. 

Prosecutors did not oppose bail for any of the nine except for Dutchman Hendrikus Jakobus Teutscher, 75, who will face a bail hearing tomorrow. 

Judge Kevin Zervos, from Australia, said each of the accused had been caught with a significant quantity of drugs, including Australian Kent Walsh. 

""I understand [Walsh was caught with] 3 kilograms of ice, which really highlights that it's a very serious problem for Australia,"" he said. 

""The fact that in every single instance it involved ice, I hate to think of the harm and damage it would have caused to the young in Australia [and] New Zealand."" 

The group's high-profile international defence barrister, Gerard McCoy QC, told 7.30 the ruling set a precedent in Hong Kong, where many other accused drug smugglers claim to be the victims of scams. 
Australian Federal Police called into question 
In court, Dr McCoy questioned what role the Australian Federal Police (AFP) had played in the group's arrests. 

He revealed one of the Australians, James Clifford, had been warned by the AFP he may be the victim of a scam before he left Brisbane Airport for Hong Kong late last year. 

""The [Hong Kong] Customs in each case knew the individuals were coming to Hong Kong,"" he said. 

""We need to know what overseas organisations were involved, if this is not a one-off cynical drug trafficking but a wider case. In reference, Mr Clifford was spoken to by AFP and a Queensland constable. 

""How was it the AFP knew not to stop him? The awareness of the AFP goes way back in time, way before he decided to leave."" 

The court has previously heard Hong Kong Customs and Excise had been tipped off about all nine accused drug smugglers by overseas authorities. 

The drug mules are due to be released from jail later today. They have been ordered to report to police once a week and are barred from leaving Hong Kong. 

They face a maximum penalty of life in jail. 

Judge Zervos is yet to put his reasons for the bail ruling on the record. 
The NYC socialite caught up in a drug scam 
The cases gained momentum after one of the world's oldest and most well-connected drug mules, 83-year-old New York socialite Elizabeth Kummerfeld, had her drug smuggling charges dropped in Hong Kong in April . 

Ms Kummerfeld, the widow of former New York deputy mayor and News America president Donald Kummerfeld, was jailed for a year after being caught at Hong Kong airport en route to Australia with 2 kilograms of ice in the lining of a backpack. 

Her charges were dropped when an investigation by Hong Kong Customs found she was a victim of a West African drug scam. 

Ms Kummerfeld, who is legally blind, had already lost her vast life savings to Nigerian email scammers posing as fundraisers for humanitarian projects. 

In an elaborate email con, she was convinced by a man posing as a Nigerian banker to travel from New York to Hong Kong and onto Australia to collect and deliver what she was told would be contracts for a multi-million-dollar compensation payment, but was instead handed a backpack lined with drugs in Hong Kong. 
Wave of drug courier arrests in Australia 
In Australia, 40 people have been arrested in the past two years after allegedly being targeted by such syndicates. 

Two-thirds of those couriers, whose cases have been finalised in the Australian courts, were cleared of any wrongdoing. 
  
The AFP issued a warning to be aware of similar scams after the arrest of 91-year-old retired dentist Victor Twartz , who was detained at Sydney Airport in July with 4.5 kilograms of cocaine in his luggage. 

Several Australians in jail for drug smuggling in China also claim to be the victims of scams, including former Adelaide jockey Anthony Bannister, intellectually disabled Brisbane man Ibrahim Jalloh, and Bengali Sherriff. 

In June, 7.30 revealed that disability pensioner John Warwick died in a Chinese prison hospital last year , where he was detained on suspicion of smuggling drugs after being lured to the city of Guangzhou by online scammers. 

This year alone, Australia has made 11 representations to China on behalf of nine Australians facing the death penalty there on drugs charges. 

In Malaysia, Australian grandmother Maria Elvira Pinto Esposto was arrested at Kuala Lumpur Airport en route from China to Melbourne with more than a kilogram of ice last year.

Six-year-old Sarah Troupe just wants to help her brothers. 

“I want to get more money to help Isaac and Matthew,” Sarah said, as she made herself comfortable at the Knightsbridge Antique Mall on Seven Mile. 

Her brothers, Matthew, 13, and Issac, 3, suffer from CHARGE syndrome, a non-random pattern of congenital anomalies. Last week, Matthew had surgery, while Isaac requires 24/7 monitoring. CHARGE affects many areas of the body, but it also affects each person differently. 

Sarah’s first try to set up a table with her toys and clothes was in her garage at the family home in Hudsonville. “I did this since Matt broke his leg,” she said. 

Her aunt, Linda McKenzie who owns Knightsbridge, invited Sarah to move her garage sale to the antique mall, 2305 W. Seven Mile in Northville. “This is so unselfish of her,” McKenzie said of her niece. 

Helping Sarah last week with her sale was not only her aunt, but her grandmother, Mary Wilkinson. “She is my precious girl,” said Wilkinson who arrived from Holly to lend a hand. 

Sarah plans to return to the antique mall to sell her toys and some clothes on Oct. 10 and 11. 

“I want to get Isaac stuff and Matthew new legs,” said Sarah, who has two older sisters, Hannah, 20, and Megan, 19.

Remember Week 2 last year? Let me refresh your memory, as it looked a little something like this:

    





Needless to say, we're a lot better off this year. With the big league matchup of Oregon at MSU and the JV scrum between Oregon State and Michigan, there was a whole lot of air time spent in Michigan this week. Rarely have I felt so bad for sportscasters, but at least some of them got to stay in East Lansing.

The talking heads found plenty of time and made up plenty of reasons to pat Jim Harbaugh on the head for...coaching football at Michigan. Talk of Big House Magic and home openers abounded, but what about the rest of the conference? Did anything else happen with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind? Let's peek around the B1G in week 2...

14 B1G Things

1. Penn State may actually be worse than we thought, which is akin to admitting we underestimated the severity of the fire in a nursing home.

2. Time to stop laughing at PSU, Maryland.

3. I'm not sure which is more impressive: Jake Rudock's ability to throw a 4-yard incompletion on 3rd and 6, or Oregon State's high school playbook.

4. Illinois has outscored their opponents 96-3 this season. Last year's Illinois team needed four games to reach 96 points, and their opponents got there first.

5. Austin Appleby throws all his passes to guys in white helmets. Purdue was just dressed incorrectly last week.

6. Joel Stave looks to have spent the offseason in the Treadstone program, having his reflexes honed and enhanced. This has brought him up to the level of your average P5 QB.

7. Ohio State actually would've looked sharper if they'd decided the game with the coin toss.

8. Jerry Kill hates sunscreen, altitude, and losing.

9. Rutgers did everything possible to lose that game and still almost found a way to win, but they stuck to their guns and lost.

10. Did the Eastern Bloc come with a gift receipt? Or a warranty?

11. Northwestern held an opponent to a quarter's worth of offense for the entire game.

12. Kirk Ferentz was thankfully out-coached by Kirk Ferentz in the highly anticipated Cy-Hawk bout.

13. Indiana got their defensive starters back from suspension. Florida International didn't notice.

14. MSU's secondary can do two things: intercept the pass, or pat a ball carrier on the shoulders as he gets an extra seven yards.

14a. As an unabashed B1G homer, I took great joy in the booming ""Go Green! Go White!"" cheer that heralded the end of Oregon's last bid for victory in East Lansing.

 
Two Non-B1G Things

15. Notre Dame quarterback Malik Zaire is out for the year with a broken ankle. We wish him a recovery that is speedy and painless as possible. Also, folks can stop trying to make ND happen now.

16. LOL @ BERT. Corporal Klinger couldn't be happier.

 
The Nitty Gritty

Buffalo at Penn State // Penn State wins 27-14. This soggy mess of a gam threatened to push the panic level in Happy Valley to supercritical levels. For the first three quarters, the Nittany Lions looked scarcely less anemic on offense on their home turf than they did a week ago on the mean streets of Philadelphia. The best play prior to the 4th quarter was Anthony Zettell's swat and grab of a Buffalo pass in the backfield. That defensive effort actually served to highlight the impotence of the PSU offense. After the turnover the Nits couldn't move the ball 19 yards for a TD, settling instead for a field goal. Hackenberg showed flashes of his old self late, hitting a quick screen for a score to put Penn State up 20-7. The much-maligned QB benefited greatly from some retooling on the offensive line, as did RB Saquon Barkley. Barkley rung up 112 yards on the day and Hack was a better-but-not-good 14-of-127 for a paltry 128 yards.

More important, though, is the fact that Hackenberg was not the victim of repeated beatings he took at the hands of Temple. None of this means PSU will be any more competitive. In fact, the plethora of obvious bubble screens and ineffective plays may mean that PSU is actually worse than we thought (i.e., last week was not a first game fluke). An inability to move the ball to the endzone from 19 yards out against a MAC team isn't the sign of an offense led by a future first-round draft pick. At least the changes up front mean that Hack may survive until conference play. PSU next up: Rutgers...sigh.

Oregon State at Michigan // Michigan wins 35-7 You've got a lot of nerve walking in here, Gary Andersen. Just kidding...welcome back. Have a hotdish and get your ass-kicked. After a week of Harbaugh love that probably sent ESPN interns scrambling for bulk purchases of Chapstick, the Wolverines made good in their home opener. Oregon State was overmatched from the word go, scoring once on a perfectly placed long ball from freshman QB Seth Collins. Otherwise, it was the outcome Michigan fans have sworn we've had coming since the three Wise Men announced the birth of Harbaugh. Oregon State's offense had nothing going for it--save the aforementioned pass--all day. The blustery Ann Arbor weather backed up a Michigan defense that really pounded the Beavers, holding Oregon State to 138 yards of total offense.

The Beavers didn't have much in the way of answers on either side of the ball. Rudock, as is typical of the man, was his own worst enemy. More than once, third and 6 resulted in an off-the-mark strike to a receiver on a 4-yard drag route. No Rudock day would be complete without an interception, but on the whole his performance was a serviceable 18/26 for 180. Michigan couldn't find the endzone through the air and relied instead on De'Veon Smith and Derrick Green, who combined for 161 yards and 4 TDs on 31 carries. The game wasn't truly out of hand until aOSU launched a long snap over the punter's head, surrendering the ball to the Wolverines inside the 5 yard line. That play was a microcosm of the whole day for Oregon State. Run plays developed at the speed of smell, and the Michigan defense spent as much time in the offensive backfield as they did on the sidelines. Overall, it was the home opener win that Harbaugh needed...but it didn't answer many questions about who this Michigan team is. Michigan next up: UNLV.

Bowling Green at Maryland // BG wins 48-27  If you're afraid of pitchfork-wielding mobs, stay away from Testudo Times for the next, oh, I don't know...year? That sounds safe. Let it first be known that Perry Hills was a state champion wrestler. Secondly, this may have been the worst 4th-quarter meltdown in the history of Maryland football. Words fail to fully capture how ineffective the Maryland secondary was at stopping anything BG could throw at them. Literally. Bowling Green is easily the most potent offense in the MAC, as Tennessee found out last week. Now Maryland has fallen victim to QB Matt Johnson's wide open passing attack. The BG signal caller tallied up 491 yards passing and six TDs--a career high.

As the Terps foundered in the 4th quarter, Randy Edsall looked to breathe life into the flagging offense by pulling state champion wrestler Perry Hills (15-of-30 for 168 and an INT) in favor of non-wrestler Caleb Rowe. The latter QB attempted three passes, completing two of them to BG defenders. The Falcons capitalized on the turnovers in grad fashion, sealing the win with backbreaking TDs. The only bright spot for Maryland was Will Likely's TD return, though he dropped a punt before the half that put BG in scoring position. This game certainly generated some great blog reactions and reader mail. Wear your helmet. But not a Maryland helmet, because they're hideous. Maryland next up: South Florida.

""Is it too late to give Maryland back to the ACC?"" -Jim D., Chicago IL


Western Illinois at Illinois // Illinois wins 44-0. There actually isn't a whole lot to say about this game. Illinois wasn't perfect. Wes Lunt threw an INT. The Illini fumbled the ball away three times. And yet somehow, the boys in blue and orange manhandled the Leathernecks of Western Illinois like a JV squad. Wes Lunt and Chayce Crouch combined for 353 yards passing and QBRs in excess of 130 and 140 respectively. The Illini spread the love around on the runs, with three backs getting eight or more carries. This was a great win for the University of Chief Illiniwek, if only because it further served to exorcise the ghosts of last season's struggle against nearly everyone. If this performance keeps up, the biggest problem for Illinois going forward will be how they handle an interim coaching situation that is shaping up to be a reprisal of the Ed Orgeron/USC debacle. Illinois needs a real, program-building head coach. Whether Bill Cubit is that guy is anyone's guess, but next week could go a long way toward answering that question. Illinois next up: UNC.

Miami at Wisconsin // Wisconsin scores again, 58-0. Another game that's blessedly light on commentary, since the Badgers had this one in hand right around the second possession. On the personnel side, Corey Clement sat out on a day where his talents were clearly not needed. Joel Stave and Rob Wheelwright connected twice for TDs--part of Stave's 236-yard air campaign (19-of-30, 1 INT). On another happy front, Mike Caputo returned to the lineup and seemed to suffer no ill effects from having his bell rung pretty hard last week against Bama. Overall, the Badgers got a nice win in Chryst's home debut and gave some backups a chance to stretch their legs, especially Ogunbowale and Taiwan Deal. Wisconsin next up: Troy.

Indiana State at Purdue // Purdue wins 38-14. Larry Bird's alma mater might want to stick to basketball after Purdue exorcised the demons of Marshall in convincing fashion. Someone wiped Appleby's visor down and set his selector switch to ""completions."" The architect of drive-killing turnovers last week suddenly went 20/34 for four touchdowns this week. Perhaps he is a cyborg whose primitive viewfinder only allows him to see white helmets? It's quite possible that he is driven by the same logic module as a first generation Roomba. Nonetheless, Darrell Hazell's team managed to wake up for this tilt, though the defense leaves something to be desired. The Sycamores came within pissing distance of 400 yards of total offense. Though when we consider their 52 point destruction of the hapless Butler Bulldogs last week, it does seem that they're at least passably competent on some fronts. The Hazell Riddle will be unraveled further next week as the vaunted Hokies of VT sail into Purdue Harbor. Will the birds have any talons without Brewer? Is there any gobble left in the bear defense? Could this prose get any more strained? Stay tuned. Purdue next up: VPI&SU.

Hawaii at Ohio State // OSU wins 38-0. Can a team be the consensus number one and staunchly refuse to act like it? Urban Meyer's Buckeyes seem hell-bent on finding out. The Buckeyes, in a word, looked terrible yesterday. Was it the short week? The emotional vapors of coming off a big game? Some bad Papa John's? Hard to say exactly. Whatever the cause, the offense sputtered and stalled for most of the first half. Cardale Jones did his level best to make every bad throw possible, and should've been picked off at least twice. The super-sized cannon finished the day 12/18 for a measly 111  yards. Barrett hardly looked better, though his read-option moves were smarter and he seemed less harried in the pocket. Zeke Elliot preserved his 100+-yard-game streak by the slimmest of margins, finishing with 101 on the day.

The Buckeyes survived largely by making plays with superior athleticism, especially given the potency of the Hawaii defensive line against the Buckeyes' stalwart front five. That's all well and good against a middling Hawaii team, but it won't work against MSU. On the plus side, the defense looked potent, snagging two of USC-transfer Max Wittek's passes for themselves, and returning a fumble for a TD. Next week looks to be just as boring, though fits and starts on the offense for a second outing in a row will raise some hackles in Columbus. Ohio State next up: NIU.

WSU at Rutgers // Wazoo wins 37-34. It's safe to say that if anyone's coach should be named for a crippling disaster, it's Rutgers's's's's. Good god, what a debacle. I should preface my disdain for this outcome with the fact that WSU lost to an FCS school last week. Secondly, Rutgers managed to lose this game despite Janarion Grant scoring two TDs on special teams. Somehow, the Rutgers offense was only able to muster 20 points in four quarters against a defense that surrendered 24 points to Portland State in a game that was so rainy that passing was nigh impossible.

Rutgers held a lead late into the fourth when WSU QB Luke Falk marched the Cougs 90 yards in the waning moments to put his team up 37-34 with 13 ticks left. Rutgers couldn't stop him from connecting with River Cracraft in the endzone, despite having 12 men on the field at the time. That was Rutgers' 11th penalty of the day. Two of those yellow hankies brought back RU touchdowns. Combine that dismal stat with three turnovers (2 fumbles and a GaryTurnover) and you get an embarrassing home loss. Janarion Grant was so close to be the hero of the day. Now, he's just helping pick up the pieces. I suppose they're missing that secondary now, given the 478 that Wazoo found through the air. Rutgers next up: at PSU...the first piece of the Triforce of Stink. 

Minnesota at Colorado State // Minnie wins 23-20. This game was a defensive grinder for 59 of 60 minutes. Minnesota entered the 4th period with a 3-point lead on the back of two FGs and a TD. The Gopher offense had been misfiring all afternoon, but their defense held the Ram offense to only ten. Leidner converted on a 4th and 6 and took the Gophers ahead for the win with 55 seconds remaining. Then, just as quickly, the Rams found their rhythm and managed to tie the game with a late FG. CSU got the ball first in OT, and on the first play they attempted a dump pass to RB Dayle Dawkins. Dawkins was hit as he secured the ball, and it caromed into the arms of DT Scott Ekpe. Minnesota pounded the ball to the one with Rodney Smith, who picked up 24 yards in 5 carries. Smith finished the day with 21 carries for 108 yards. Leidner was a marginal 23/45 for 233 and two crucial TDs. The best highlight beyond the lineman interception was the redness of Jerry Kill's face. He may not be Minnesotan, but he burns like one. Jerry's team found a way to get it done against a CSU squad that will end up being very good this year. Ugly win, but a win nonetheless. Minnesota next up: Kent State.

Northwestern hosting Eastern Illinois // NU wins 41-0. This was just a laugher. Northwestern came to play, and play they did. Clayton Thorson threw his first career TD pass. He finished the day 11 of 16 for a respectable 156. The Cats didn't need to throw much, as the EIU defense couldn't stop much of anything. Of the Wildcats nearly 500 yards of offense, 344 came on the ground courtesy of Justin Jackson and Warren Long. The hilarity reached a crescendo when EIU QB Jalen Whitlow tried a horribly considered shovel pass as he scrambled to sideline. Northwestern's Matthew Harris made that his second INT of the day, and took it 71 yards the other direction to make sure everyone noticed. Watch out, B1G West...the Cats feel like playing football this year. NW next up: at Duuuuuke.

Iowa at Iowa State // Surprisingly, Iowa wins 31-17. The Cy-Hawk showdown was closer than the final score indicates. The various Iowas were locked at 17 when the Hawkeyes' Canzeri fumbled on the ISU ten yard line, killing the go-ahead drive. Iowa's defense held on the ensuing possession, forcing the Cyclones to kick. After teammate Desmond King returned the punt to the 50 yard line, C.J. Beathard found Riley McCarron in the endzone for the go-ahead TD. Iowa's defense held again. Desmond King decided to help out again with an interception, and Iowa drove to the endzone to seal the game with one final TD. An emotional week came to a close with the Hawkeyes, boasting #9 on the side of their helmets in honor of Tyler Sash's passing, hoisted the trophy in triumph. The passing of Sash and Roy Marble added some extra meaning to a win that has eluded Kirk Ferentz on more than one occasion. Beathard finished with 215 yards and three TDs, while the Hawkeye defenders stuffed ISU for only 63 on the ground. Overall, it was a great catharsis for a team in need of a big win in this game. Iowa next up: Pitt. 

Oregon at MSU // MSU wins 31-28. Our MSU ""writer"" will have a full recap of this phenomenal game this evening, but suffice it to say that whatever Dantonio did to prepare his offense and D-line, it worked. Spartan lineman were all over the backfield, swallowing up runners and making Vernon Adams Jr. run for his life. Sadly, he's pretty good at running for his life and he burned the Spartans on more than one occasion. Which brings us to the the Spartan secondary. In a word, eeesh. The Spartans either make an insane no-look interception, or let the receiver catch the ball unmolested and rumble for ten yards or more. They looked particularly vulnerable on the edge, unable to shed the blocks of Oregon receivers for much of the night. Connor Cook had a few miscues, but looked largely like the senior veteran he is. Nonetheless, it was the MSU defense that saved the day again, holding on 4th and goal in a defensive stand that conjured memories of the Rose Bowl. It was a complete victory for the Spartans over a team that manages to reload year in and year out. Stay tuned for an in-depth recap this evening. MSU next up: Air Force.

South Alabama at Nebraska // Nebby rolls 48-9. This was a case of what you can do versus what you can't. South Alabama actually bested the Huskers through the air, 313 yards to 303. Unfortunately, they could only muster 16 yards rushing against whatever version of the Black Shirts we're seeing now. Tommy Armstrong threw for two TDs and backup Ryker Fyfe added one for good measure. Another three TDs on the ground and a few FGs, and the Huskers enjoyed a nice emotional rebuilding after the heart-rending loss to BYU last week. Not much of a challenge, but then again, that's nice sometimes. UNL next up: at Miami of Florida. 

FIU at Indiana // Indiana wins 36-22. Oh, Hoosiers. With their defense back to mostly full strength, Indiana looked to show the rest of the B1G they can play with the big boys. So far...well, you be the judge. The Hoosiers spent the evening epitomizing a bend but don't break philosophy (because not bending it out of the question, one assumes). The Hoosiers held FIU to 409 yards, which doesn't sound great until last week's 659-yard performance against powerhouse Southern Illinois is considered. Any progress is good progress. The Hoosiers didn't put this one away until the waning minutes when, with his team clinging to a 29-22 lead, freshman Jameel Cook, Jr. intercepted a 4th and goal pass and took it 96 yards to seal the win. Indiana's offense will likely never be the same without Tevin Coleman, but Jordan Howard's 27 carries for 159 isn't bad, either. Indiana next up: Western Kentucky.",3371,"Welcome to Week 2, Where Beating the Beavers is a Statement and the MAC Ruins Everything Remember Week 2 last year? Let me refresh your memory, as it looked a little something like this: Needless to say, we're a lot better off this year.

I can guess people"," reasons why teams are more consistent on all three weekends -- just ask Tom Hoolahan's offensive line or how much extra defensive help Ohio did with their young secondary when they were struggling against Big Ten Conference opponents despite having quite an average defense (which certainly improved if not nearly by huge) versus top defenses over those two weeks together that allowed 20 points out-of 3 turnover margin vs No Man F*ck You In Football from ESPN Insider Michael Strauss...the Mizzou coach left us alone Monday morning thanks really good coaches because you know what he does; maybe our entire conference made him feel pretty important right before his return home after working hard towards himself coming back here...

916c6db7-778c-40c2-8089-51eb1f3f8b11,Carducci Quartet in Chichester,News,Mid Sussex Today,"The harmony is more than musical among the members of the Carducci Quartet who perform for the Chichester Chamber Concerts series on Thursday, October 1 at 7.30pm. 

		 
The quartet comprises two married couples. Matthew Denton (violin) is married to Emma Denton (cello); and Michelle Fleming (violin) is married to Eoin Schmidt-Martin (viola): “And the pros generally outweigh the cons,” laughs Michelle. “We know of only two quartets like that internationally, and it is great in the way that we travel so much it is really nice to be able to travel together and share so many new experiences together. And also obviously it is great from the diary point of view, co-ordinating our diaries and getting together. But the flip side to all that is that it makes child care rather expensive!” 
 
Both couples have got two children, aged six and three for Michelle, aged seven and nine for the other couple. 

			 
“But fortunately we have got very supportive families.” 



 
The quartet was founded in 1997 by Matt and Emma and performed in Italy in the birthplace of the poet Giosuè Carducci: “Apparently the mayor stood up and said ‘You should take the name Carducci!’ They thought they had better. Matt clearly got caught up in the occasion. He proposed to Emma!” 

Emma and Matt had met at the age of 12. Michelle and Eoin have also been playing together a long time. 

“When you know each other so well, sometimes things just come naturally, but actually sometimes within the couples you can be harder on each other if you were not so close, but then within the couples I suppose we know what the other one can take! But really the main thing is just not to take the work home with you, but actually that is much easier when you have got children. With the children, you are far too busy to think of other things!” 

The quartet is regarded as one of today’s most successful string quartets. Performing more than 90 concerts worldwide each year, they run their own recording label Carducci Classics and an annual festival in Gloucestershire. In 2014, they offered their first festival in Castagneto–Carducci in Tuscany, but for their big project for 2015 the Carducci has been presenting the complete cycle of Shostakovich quartets in Europe and North and South America.  They did their first at the Cheltenham Festival and then next at Shakespeare’s Globe. 

			 
“We did all 15 cycles in one day. It is about seven hours of music, but we did it as four concerts during the day. It had not been done before by us or anybody else in the UK. The Globe were hugely supportive of it. The staff were amazing. They decided that they would do just one ticket for the entire day so people could dip in and dip out, but it was great. Everybody really invested in it. There was a great atmosphere in there anyway, but the audience were wonderful. There was a real sense that the audience were participating in it.” 

The quartet will include Shostakovich’s String Quartet No 3 as part of their Chichester programme, alongside Haydn,  Arvo Pärt and Beethoven. The recital will be in the Assembly Room, Chichester Council House.

Violence against women is widely recognised as a global issue. It is an often invisible, but common form of violence, and an insidious violation of human rights. It has serious impacts on the health and wellbeing of those affected and exacts significant economic costs on communities and nations. Australia is not immune. 
 
The National Community Attitudes towards Violence Against Women Survey was developed by VicHealth in partnership with The University of Melbourne, the Social Research Centre and experts across Australia, and supported by the Australian Government Department of Social Services as part of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010–2022 . 
 
This is the third survey of its kind, with the first undertaken in 1995 and the second in 2009. 
 
The survey tells us that we have been able to challenge a culture that allows violence against women to occur. There have been sustained improvements since 1995 in a number of areas. However, there are other areas in which progress has been minimal, along with some concerning negative findings. 
 
This report focuses on the responses given by 1,923 young people aged between 16 – 22 years who participated in NCAS. These findings are compared with those aged 35 – 64 years of age, enabling results to be compared between two generations: young people and their parents.

Who is the next team to suffer a major scalp? The lowdown: Rugby World Cup 2015 Japan's upset of South Africa has justifiably been labelled the greatest upset in the history of the Rugby World Cup and probably the history of international rugby.

Could we see another upset at this World Cup? And who are the likely candidates?

There are another eight chances for a genuine minnow to knock over a top five team in pool play at this World Cup.

The next chance of a real boilover is probably when Australia face Fiji on Thursday morning (AEST). However, Fiji have never beaten a big five team and have just three wins in total against all tier 1 nations - one each against Argentina, Scotland and Wales. The latter came in the 2007 World Cup.

Fiji and Australia have met four times in the World Cup era and each has resulted in at least a 40-point win for Australia.

Even so, a win to Fiji here is probably more conceivable than Japan beating South Africa was prior to that game being played.

Three potential upsets will feature New Zealand against rank outsiders Namibia, Georgia and Tonga. Given New Zealand's bully boy record against minnow teams, it's virtually inconceivable that any of these games will result in an upset, however.

The All Blacks have won by an average of 60 points against teams outside of tier 1 in the World Cup era. Only twice has a minnow team got within 20 points of them in this period.

South African fans will be very nervous when their team faces Samoa. Traditionally the strongest of the non-tier 1 teams, Samoa beat Australia in Sydney in 2011 and have taken another 10 tier 1 scalps since 1991 - including Wales four times and Scotland (who they also meet in pool play) as recently as 2012.

Outside of games involving the traditional big five, a couple of other fixtures have upset potential. Argentina, who have improved since joining the Rugby Championship will have to overcome Tonga - who have a World Cup upset against France in their recent history - and Georgia who showed what a gutsy and difficult side they are to beat in their opening game.

Scotland are classified as a tier 1 side and they will have to overcome Japan and Samoa, although on the form of recent years a loss to either would not be considered a massive upset.
